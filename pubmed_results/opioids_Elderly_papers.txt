TI  - The Use of Opioids and Antipsychotics in Elderly with Dementia – Have Opioids
      Replaced Antipsychotics in Treating Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia?
PG  - 259-67
AB  - Background:: Opioids are used with increasing frequency. Elderly with dementia
      are prescribed opioids more frequent than elderly without. One possible
      explanation is that opioids may be used not only to treat pain but also
      behavioral symptoms. Objective:: To test the hypothesis that strong opioid use,
      especially transdermal formulations, had increased, especially in elderly with
      dementia, in parallel with a decrease in antipsychotic use. Methods::
      Population-based cross-sectional study conducted using nationwide Danish
      registers with data on Denmark’s entire elderly population age ≥65 (2000:
      n = 802,106; 2015: n = 1,056,476). The registers were used to identify elderly
      with and without dementia and filled prescriptions for opioids and
      antipsychotics. Annual prevalence of opioid and antipsychotic use from 2000–2015 
      was calculated. Results:: Prevalence of opioid use increased by 35% (24.2 to
      32.5%) among elderly with dementia and by 13% among elderly without (14.9 to
      16.8%) from 2000–2015. The disproportionate increase in opioid use among elderly 
      with dementia was mainly driven by an increase in strong opioids (dementia: 11.7 
      to 23.1%; without dementia: 5.9 to 7.4%). Use of antipsychotics decreased during 
      the same period (dementia: 31.3 to 19.3%; no dementia: 4.5 to 2.7%). Conclusion::
      From 2000–2015, use of opioids among the elderly increased with a
      disproportionately higher increase among elderly with dementia. The parallel
      decrease in the use of antipsychotics may suggest that opioids to some extent
      have replaced antipsychotics in managing behavioral symptoms, despite safety
      concerns and lack of evidence for effect of opioids. Future research should focus
      on potential risks associated with increased opioid use.

TI  - Consistency between anticholinergic burden scales in the elderly with fractures.
LID - e0228532
AB  - Objective: Falls and bone fractures are important causes of morbidity and
      mortality in the elderly. The objective of this study was to identify the degree 
      of consistency between the anticholinergic scales used for patients diagnosed
      with fractures. Methods: This was an analytical agreement study conducted in
      patients diagnosed with vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in Colombia. The
      quadratic-weighted kappa coefficient was used to identify the consistency between
      the Anticholinergic Drug Scale-ADS, Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale-ACB
      and Anticholinergic Risk Scale-ARS in assessing the prescriptions of fracture
      patients during the month prior to the fracture, during their stay as an
      inpatient and at discharge, according to Landis criteria. Results: 220 patients
      with fractures were included, with a mean age of 75.3±10.3 years, and 68.2% were 
      women. The ACB scale identified the highest anticholinergic burden (26.8%) in
      prescriptions made the month before the fracture, and the highest agreement was
      between ACB and ADS (0.717); during hospitalization and at discharge, the
      cholinergic antagonists were best identified with ADS (77.7% and 72.1%,
      respectively), with the best agreement between ACB and ARS (0.613 and 0.568,
      respectively). The prescription of tramadol was found in 64.1% of hospitalized
      patients and in 61.4% of patients at the time of discharge. Conclusions: The
      scales evaluated show marked discrepancies between them, with highly variable
      frequencies of anticholinergic drugs identified at the different prescription
      times, and with low agreement among them, which is why the scales are not
      interchangeable in patients with bone fractures.

TI  - Lumbar Erector Spinae Plane Block as a Main Anesthetic Method for Hip Surgery in 
      High Risk Elderly Patients: Initial Experience with a Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - Objective: Since initial description by Forero for thoracic region, ultrasound
      guided erector spinae plane (ESP) block has experienced several surgeries for
      postoperative pain management, chronic pain or surgical anesthesia. Although ESP 
      block has been reported to provide effective analgesia in the thoracic region,
      its effect in lumbar region still unclear. In this study we aimed to showed our
      successful experience with lumbar ESP block as a main anesthetic technique in
      fifteen high risk elderly patients undergoing hip surgery with mild propofol
      sedation. Materials and Methods: In this observational study high risk elderly
      fifteen patients received lumbar ESP block as a main anesthetic technique with
      mild propofol sedation. 40 mL of local anesthetic mixture (20 mL bupivacaine
      0.5%, 10 mL lidocaine 2%, and 10 mL normal saline) was administered between the
      erector spinae muscles and transverse process at the level of the 4th lumbar
      vertebra. Also we demonstrate magnetic resonance images and discuss the anatomic 
      basis of lumbar ESP block. Results: All patients’ surgeries were completed
      without requirement for general anesthesia or local anesthesia infiltration of
      the surgical site. All patients’ pain scores were <2/10 in the recovery room.
      Significant contrast spread was observed between the Th12 and L5 transverse
      process and erector spinae muscle and between multifidus muscle and iliocostal
      muscle at the L2–4 levels. Contrast material was observed at the anterior of the 
      transverse process spreading to the paravertebral, foraminal and partially
      epidural area/spaces and also in the areas where the lumbar nerves enter the
      psoas muscle. Conclusion: Lumbar ESP block when combined with mild sedoanalgesia 
      provides adequate and safe anesthesia in high risk elderly patients undergoing
      hip surgery.

TI  - The effectiveness of additional thoracic paravertebral block in improving the
      anesthetic effects of regional anesthesia for proximal humeral fracture surgery
      in elderly patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 204
AB  - Background: The innervation of the shoulder-upper-extremity area is complicated
      and unclear. Regional anesthesia with a brachial plexus and cervical plexus block
      is probably inadequate for the proximal humeral surgery. Missing blockade of the 
      T1–T2 nerves may be the reason. We conduct this prospective randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) to explore whether an additional T2 thoracic paravertebral block
      (TPVB) can improve the success rate of regional anesthesia for elderly patients
      in proximal humeral fracture surgery. Methods/design: The patients aged 65 years 
      or older, referred for anterior-approach proximal humeral fracture surgery, will 
      be enrolled. Each patient will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a combined
      interscalene brachial plexus with superficial cervical plexus block (IC)
      (combined interscalene brachial plexus with superficial cervical plexus block) or
      an IC block combined with thoracic paravertebral block (ICTP) block (combined
      thoracic paravertebral block with brachial plexus and superficial cervical plexus
      block). The primary outcome is the success rate of regional anesthesia without
      rescue analgesic methods. The secondary outcomes are as follows: sensory block at
      the surgical area, proportion of patients who need rescue anesthesia
      (intravenously administered remifentanil or conversion to general anesthesia),
      cumulative doses of intraoperative vasoactive medications and adverse events. The
      total sample size is estimated to be 80 patients. Discussion: This RCT aims to
      confirm whether an additional T2 TPVB can provide better anesthetic effects of
      regional anesthesia with brachial and cervical plexus block in elderly patients
      undergoing proximal humeral surgery. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: 
      NCT03919422. Registered on 19 April 2019.

TI  - EEG alpha activity increased in response to transcutaneous electrical nervous
      stimulation in young healthy subjects but not in the healthy elderly.
LID - e8330
AB  - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is used not only in the
      treatment of pain but also in the examination of sensory functions. With aging,
      there is decreased sensitivity to somatosensory stimuli. It is essential to
      examine the effect of TENS application on the sensory functions in the brain by
      recording the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and the effect of
      aging on the sensory functions of the brain during the application. The present
      study aimed to investigate the effect of the application of TENS on the brain’s
      electrical activity and the effect of aging on the sensory functions of the brain
      during application of TENS. A total of 15 young (24.2 ± 3.59) and 14 elderly
      (65.64 ± 4.92) subjects were included in the study. Spontaneous EEG was recorded 
      from 32 channels during TENS application. Power spectrum analysis was performed
      by Fast Fourier Transform in the alpha frequency band (8–13 Hz) for all subjects.
      Repeated measures of analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis (p < 
      0.05). Young subjects had increased alpha power during the TENS application and
      had gradually increased alpha power by increasing the current intensity of TENS
      (p = 0.035). Young subjects had higher alpha power than elderly subjects in the
      occipital and parietal locations (p = 0.073). We can, therefore, conclude that
      TENS indicated increased alpha activity in young subjects. Young subjects had
      higher alpha activity than elderly subjects in the occipital and somatosensory
      areas. To our knowledge, the present study is one of the first studies examining 
      the effect of TENS on spontaneous EEG in healthy subjects. Based on the results
      of the present study, TENS may be used as an objective method for the examination
      of sensory impairments, and in the evaluative efficiency of the treatment of pain
      conditions.

PG  - 54-60
AB  - Elderly patients suffering from chronic cardio-pulmonary diseases commonly
      experience acute respiratory failure. As in younger patients, a well-known
      therapeutic approach of noninvasive mechanical ventilation is able to prevent
      orotracheal intubation in a large number of severe scenarios in elderly patients.
      In addition, this type of ventilation is frequently applied in elderly patients
      who refuse intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. The rate of failure of
      noninvasive ventilation may be reduced by means of the integration of new
      technological devices (i.e., high-flow nasal cannula, extracorporeal CO2 removal,
      cough assistance and high-frequency chest wall oscillation, and fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy). Ethical issues with end-of-life decisions and the choice of the
      environment are not clearly defined in the treatment of elderly with acute
      respiratory insufficiency.
