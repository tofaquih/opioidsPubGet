TI  - The analgesic effects of buprenorphine (Vetergesic or Simbadol) in cats
      undergoing dental extractions: A randomized, blinded, clinical trial.
LID - e0230079
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of two dosage regimens using 
      two different concentrations of buprenorphine in cats undergoing dental
      extractions. Twenty-three cats with oral disease (8.2 ± 2.2 years old; 4.9 ± 0.9 
      kg) were included in a prospective, blinded, randomized clinical trial. Cats
      randomly received either Simbadol (1.8 mg/mL; 0.24 mg/kg, subcutaneously, every
      24h: SG, n = 11) or Vetergesic (0.3 mg/mL; 0.02 mg/kg, intramuscularly, every 8h:
      VG, n = 12) throughout the study. They were admitted at day 0, underwent oral
      examination/radiographs/treatment under general anesthesia
      (buprenorphine-propofol-isoflurane-meloxicam-local anesthetic blocks) at day 1
      and discharged at day 4. Sedation and pain were scored using the dynamic
      interactive visual analog scale (day 1) and the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain
      Scale-Feline (CMPS-F; up to postoperative 8 hours at day 1, 8 am, 4 pm and
      midnight at days 2 and 3, and 8 am at day 4), respectively. Rescue analgesia was 
      administered with hydromorphone (0.05 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 or 0.1 mg/kg
      intramuscularly after day 2) when CMPS-F ≥ 5. Resentment defined as any type of
      escape behavior associated with aversion to drug administration was recorded.
      Sedation and pain scores, the prevalence of rescue analgesia and resentment
      during drug administration were analyzed using linear mixed models and Fisher’s
      exact test, respectively (p < 0.05). Pain and sedation scores were not
      significantly different between groups. Sedation scores were significantly higher
      up to postoperative 2 hours in both groups. Pain scores in SG and VG were
      significantly higher up to postoperative 8 hours and 8 am of day 2, respectively,
      than baseline. Prevalence of rescue analgesia and resentment were not
      significantly different between groups (SG: 27.3%, VG: 33.3% and SG: 0%, VG: 25%,
      respectively). Simbadol produced similar analgesic effects to Vetergesic without 
      resentment during drug administration.

TI  - Effect of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Combined With
      Patient-Controlled Intravenous Morphine Analgesia on Analgesic Use and
      Post-Thoracotomy Pain. A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Sham-Controlled, 
      Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trial.
LID - 125
AB  - Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used for various
      chronic pain conditions, but experience with tDCS for acute postoperative pain is
      limited. This study investigated the effect of tDCS vs. sham stimulation on
      postoperative morphine consumption and pain intensity after thoracotomy. Methods:
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled
      trial in lung cancer patients undergoing thoracotomy under general anesthesia.
      All patients received patient-controlled (PCA) intravenous morphine and
      intercostal nerve blocks at the end of surgery. The intervention group (a-tDCS, n
      = 31) received anodal tDCS over the left primary motor cortex (C3-Fp2) for 20 min
      at 1.2 mA, on five consecutive days; the control group (n = 31) received sham
      stimulation. Morphine consumption, number of analgesia demands, and pain
      intensity at rest, with movement and with cough were recorded at the following
      intervals: immediately before (T1), immediately after intervention (T2), then
      every hour for 4 h (Т3–Т6), then every 6 h (Т7–Т31) for 5 days. We recorded
      outcomes on postoperative days 1 and 5 and conducted a phone interview inquiring 
      about chronic pain 1 year later (NCT03005548). Results: A total of 62 patients
      enrolled, but tDCS was prematurely stopped in six patients. Fifty-five patients
      (27 a-tDCS, 28 sham) had three or more tDCS applications and were included in the
      analysis. Cumulative morphine dose in the first 120 h after surgery was
      significantly lower in the tDCS [77.00 (54.00–123.00) mg] compared to sham group 
      [112.00 (79.97–173.35) mg, p = 0.043, Cohen’s d = 0.42]. On postoperative day 5, 
      maximum visual analog scale (VAS) pain score with cough was significantly lower
      in the tDCS group [29.00 (20.00–39.00) vs. 44.50 (30.00–61.75) mm, p = 0.018],
      and pain interference with cough was 80% lower [10.00 (0.00–30.00) vs. 50.00
      (0.00–70.00), p = 0.013]. One year after surgery, there was no significant
      difference between groups with regard to chronic pain and analgesic use.
      Conclusion: In lung cancer patients undergoing thoracotomy, three to five tDCS
      sessions significantly reduced cumulative postoperative morphine use, maximum VAS
      pain scores with cough, and pain interference with cough on postoperative day 5, 
      but there was no obvious long-term benefit from tDCS.

TI  - Effect of postoperative Trendelenburg position on shoulder pain after
      gynecological laparoscopic procedures: a randomized clinical trial.
LID - 27
AB  - Background: Laparoscopic surgery has become a standard of care for many
      gynecological surgeries due to its lower morbidity, pain and cost compared to
      open techniques. Unfortunately, the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) to insufflate the
      abdomen is the main contributor to post-operative shoulder pain. Methods: We aim 
      to assess the effect of postoperative Trendelenburg position on shoulder pain
      after gynecological laparoscopic procedures. We hypothesize that maintaining the 
      patient in Trendelenburg for 24 h postoperatively will significantly decrease
      postoperative shoulder pain and analgesic consumption. After obtaining written
      informed consent, 108 patients were prospectively randomized into two groups. In 
      the control group, patients underwent standard gynecologic laparoscopic
      procedures; then after passive deflation of the pneumoperitoneum at the end of
      the surgery, the patients were placed in supine head up position in the post
      anesthesia care unit (PACU) and received our institution’s common postoperative
      care. Patients in the intervention group were subjected to the same maneuver but 
      were positioned in a Trendelenburg position (20 °) once fully awake and
      cooperative in the PACU and retained this position for the first 24 h. Numerical 
      rating scale (NRS) was used to assess shoulder pain and nausea upon patient
      arrival to the PACU, at 4, 6, 12 (primary outcome) and 24 h postoperatively. Time
      to first rescue pain medication, total rescue pain medications and overall
      satisfaction with pain control were recorded. 101 patients were included in the
      final data analysis. Results: Both groups were comparable in terms of baseline
      characteristics. NRS pain scores were significantly lower in the intervention
      group at 12 h compared to the control group (0 [0–1] versus 5 [1–4], p < 0.001), 
      furthermore improvement in postoperative shoulder pain between time of arrival to
      PACU (time zero) and 12 h postoperatively was significantly higher in patients
      allocated to the experimental group compared to the control group. Pain scores
      were significantly lower in patients allocated to the experimental group versus
      the control group (0 [0–1] versus 5 [1–4], p < 0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion,
      Trendelenburg position is an easy non-pharmacologic intervention that is
      beneficial in reducing postoperative shoulder pain following gynecologic
      laparoscopic surgery. Trial registration: Retrospectively registered at

TI  - Effect of preemptive analgesia with ibuprofen in the control of postoperative
      pain in dental implant surgeries: A randomized, triple-blind controlled clinical 
      trial.
PG  - e71-8
AB  - Background: Preemptive analgesia has as its basic principle the administration of
      analgesics before the onset of painful stimuli, in order to reduce or prevent
      postoperative pain, but this question is little explored in implantology. Thus,
      this study was conducted in order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ibuprofen 
      in pain prevention after unit implant surgery. Material and Methods: For this
      triple-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trial, 54
      insertion surgeries of unitary implants were performed. Two groups have received 
      two different protocols 1 hour before surgery: Ibuprofen group (IBU) 600 mg of
      ibuprofen; and (2) placebo group (maize starch). The intensity of the pain was
      evaluated through the visual analogue scale (VAS) in 6 times (1, 6, 12, 24, 48
      and 72 hours after the surgery). Patients were instructed to take 750 mg of
      paracetamol as rescue medication, if necessary. The occurrence and the intensity 
      of pain were analyzed by means of an analysis of variance ANOVA with repeated
      measurements using the general linear model procedure. Results: The IBU group had
      significantly lower VAS scores overall (IBU = 0.30, ± 0.57; placebo = 1.14, ±
      1.07; p<0.001) and at all times in the intra, intergroup comparisons and
      time/group interaction than the placebo group (p<0.001). The use of rescue
      medication was significantly lower and the postoperative time was longer in the
      IBU group compared to placebo (p = 0.002). Conclusions: The single use of
      ibuprofen was found to be significantly superior in reducing pain after unit
      implant surgery compared to placebo. Key words:Analgesia, dental implants, pain, 
      surgery, oral.

TI  - Effects of ultrasound-guided paravertebral block on MMP-9 and postoperative pain 
      in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
LID - 59
AB  - Background: Local anesthesia can reduce the response to surgical stress and
      decrease the consumption of opioids, which may reduce immunosuppression and
      potentially delay postoperative tumor recurrence. We compared paravertebral block
      (PVB) combined with general anesthesia (GA) and general anesthesia regarding
      their effects on postoperative pain and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) after 
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Methods: 54 patients
      undergoing elective VATS lobectomy at a single tertiary care, teaching hospital
      located in Qingdao between May 2, 2018 and Sep 28, 2018 were randomised by
      computer to either paravertebral block combined with general anesthesia or
      general anesthesia. The primary outcomes were pain scores at rest and on cough at
      1, 4, 24, and 48 h after surgery. The secondary outcome were plasma
      concentrations of MMP-9, complications, and length of postoperative hospital
      stay. Results: 75 were enrolled to the study, of whom 21 were excluded before
      surgery. We analyzed lobectomy patients undergoing paravertebral block combined
      with general anesthesia (n = 25) or general anesthesia (n = 24). Both groups were
      similar regarding baseline characteristics. Pain scores at rest at 4 h and 24 h, 
      on cough at 4 h were lower in PVB/GA group, compared with GA group (P < 0.05).
      There were no difference in pain scores at rest at 1 h, 48 h and on cough at 1 h,
      24 h, and 48 h between groups. Patients in the PVB/GA group showed a greater
      decrease in plasma MMP-9 level at T1 and T2 after VATS lobectomy (P < 0.05).
      Postoperative complications and length of stay did not differ by anesthetic
      technique. Conclusions: The paravertebral block/general anesthesia can provide
      statistically better pain relief and attenuate MMP-9 response to surgery and
      after VATS lobectomy. This technique may be beneficial for patients to recover
      rapidly after lung surgery and reduce postoperative tumor recurrence. Trial

TI  - General anesthesia technique and perception of quality of postoperative recovery 
      in women undergoing cholecystectomy: A randomized, double-blinded clinical trial.
LID - e0228805
AB  - Background: The two most common general anesthesia techniques are total
      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and venous/inhalation balanced general anesthesia
      (BGA). It is unclear whether any of these two techniques affect patient
      perception of the quality of recovery. The aim of this randomized, double-blinded
      clinical trial was to assess the quality of postoperative recovery of women
      undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. We compared
      patients who received TIVA with those who received BGA. We also evaluated the
      factors that may decrease patient-perceived quality of postoperative recovery.
      Methods: We prospectively recruited 121 women aged 18–65 years who were scheduled
      for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis. These patients
      were randomized to receive TIVA (target-controlled infusion of propofol and
      remifentanil) or BGA (continuous remifentanil infusion and sevoflurane
      inhalation). To measure the quality of postanesthetic and postoperative recovery,
      we administered the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) questionnaire 24 hours after 
      the patient awoke from anesthesia. Results: All 60 patients in the TIVA group
      responded to QoR-40 (median, 188 points; minimum 128; maximum 200). Sixty-one
      patients in the BGA group had a mean QoR-40 score of 186 points (median, 188
      points; minimum 146; maximum 200). There was no significant difference in the
      QoR-40 score between the two groups (p = 0.577). The patients who presented
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain had worse perception of the
      quality of postoperative recovery. Conclusions: Both TIVA and BGA had a similar
      effect on the perception of the quality of postoperative recovery in women
      undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. PONV and pain may negatively
      affect patient perception of the quality of postoperative recovery.

TI  - Effect of Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Pain Intensity, Functional 
      Efficiency, and Postural Control Parameters in Patients with Chronic Low Back
      Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
LID - 568
AB  - Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide, placing a
      significant economic burden on healthcare systems. Radial extracorporeal shock
      wave therapy (rESWT) is useful in the rehabilitation of orthopedic diseases;
      however, there is still limited evidence for patients with LBP. The aim of this
      study was to assess the effect of rESWT on pain level, functional efficiency, and
      parameters of postural control in patients with LBP. Participants were randomized
      into group A (n = 20) treated with rESWT and group B (n = 20) treated with sham
      rESWT (placebo). Both groups received conventional physiotherapy, including core 
      stability exercises. The following tests were performed: the Laitinen Pain Scale 
      (LPS), the Roland–Morris Questionnaire (RMQ), the original Schober Test (OST),
      and a stabilometric platform for the assessment of postural sway, including total
      sway path (TSP). We found that the analgesic effect was higher after rESWT,
      especially in the follow-up’s (p < 0.05). Similar results were found for
      functional efficiency and range of motion (p < 0.05). The improved posture
      stability in placebo group B was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The
      stabilometric parameters in group A were still gradually improved and
      statistically significant, even in follow-ups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the
      rESWT had a significant effect on the reduction of pain and the improvement of
      functional condition compared to a conventional physiotherapy program. Also,
      rESWT with core stability exercises led to significant improvements in postural
      sway compared with conventional physiotherapy in patients with LBP.

TI  - Photobiomodulation therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on
      chronic neck pain patients: Study protocol clinical trial (SPIRIT Compliant).
LID - e19191
AB  - Introduction:: Chronic neck pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder that is
      associated with functional disability and decreased of quality of life.
      Electrophysical agents are commonly used to relieve pain, however the effects of 
      combined use of these agents are little studied. The objective is to investigate 
      the efficacy of photobiomodulation and electrical stimulation to relieve pain,
      both in isolation and combined. Materials and methods:: This a 4-arm randomized
      placebo-controlled trial with patient and evaluator blinded. This study will be
      performed in Department of Physical Therapy at Federal University of São Carlos, 
      São Carlos/SP, Brazil. One hundred and forty-four patients with chronic neck pain
      will be randomized into 4 groups: active photobiomodulation therapy with active
      electrical stimulation, active photobiomodulation therapy, active electrical
      stimulation, or placebo treatment. They will receive 10 sessions of treatment.
      Primary outcome: pain intensity (measured by pain numerical rating scale)
      posttreatment. Secondary outcomes: pain during movement, neck disability, range
      of motion, pressure pain threshold, temporal summation, conditioned pain
      modulation, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, quality of life, analgesic
      intake, and global perceived effect at posttreatment (10 sessions). Pain
      intensity and global perceived effect will also be measured after 6 weeks
      randomization. Discussion:: The findings of this study might clarify the
      importance of using the photobiomodulation therapy and transcutaneous electrical 
      nerve stimulation for patients with chronic neck pain. Trial registration::
      NCT04020861.

TI  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for the Management of Multiple Sclerosis–Related
      Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 8-14
AB  - Background:: Pain is a common and often debilitating symptom in persons with
      multiple sclerosis (MS). Besides interfering with daily functioning, pain in MS
      is associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Although cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain has been found to be an effective treatment in 
      other populations, there has been a dearth of research in persons with MS.
      Methods:: Persons with MS with at least moderate pain severity (N = 20) were
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: CBT plus standard care or MS-related
      education plus standard care, each of which met for 12 sessions. Changes in pain 
      severity, pain interference, and depressive symptom severity from baseline to
      15-week follow-up were assessed using a 2×2 factorial design. Participants also
      rated their satisfaction with their treatment and accomplishment of personally
      meaningful behavioral goals. Results:: Both treatment groups rated their
      treatment satisfaction as very high and their behavioral goals as largely met,
      although only the CBT plus standard care group's mean goal accomplishment ratings
      represented significant improvement. Although there were no significant
      differences between groups after treatment on the three primary outcomes, there
      was an overall improvement over time for pain severity, pain interference, and
      depressive symptom severity. Conclusions:: Cognitive behavioral therapy or
      education-based programs may be helpful adjunctive treatments for persons with MS
      experiencing pain.

TI  - Intravenous calcium Gluconate alleviates Lead-induced abdominal pain, a
      randomized clinical trial.
LID - 23
AB  - Background: In 2016, in a lead poisoning outbreak in Iran, physicians reported
      thousands of opium users who presented to emergency departments (EDs) with
      intractable severe abdominal pain which did not respond to any narcotic
      medication. During the same period of time, we investigated the efficacy of
      intravenous calcium gluconate in alleviating lead-induced abdominal pain.
      Methods: In a single-center, single blinded, randomized controlled trial, a
      convenient sample of adult opium-addicted patients who presented to an academic
      ED with abdominal pain and had an initial diagnosis of lead poisoning were
      included and randomly subjected to two treatment groups receiving conventional
      treatment (morphine 0.1 mg/kg + normal saline; group 1) and conventional
      treatment plus 1 g of intravenous calcium gluconate (group 2) to alleviate their 
      abdominal pain. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was determined by each patient (0
      to 100 mm) before treatment, and 15, 30, and 60 min after intervention. Results: 
      A total of 50 patients (25 in each group) were enrolled. Blood lead levels, VAS
      scores before treatment, and mean administered dose of morphine were similar
      between the two groups. After treatment, mean VAS score dropped to 64.7± 10.4 vs.
      67.1± 10.9 at 15 min (P = 0.437), 64.6± 10.9 vs. 58.0 ± 11.2 at 30 min
      (P = 0.041), and 63.8± 10.7 vs. 53.6± 10.9 at 60 min (P = 0.002) in groups 1 and 
      2, respectively. Conclusion: Intravenous calcium gluconate administration along
      with morphine can improve abdominal pain in lead poisoning due to the ingestion
      of lead-contaminated opium. Further interventional studies are recommended to see
      if response to calcium salts in suspected lead-induced abdominal pain can rule in
      lead toxicity. Trial registration: IRCT20171009036661N2. Registered 27 May 2018 -

TI  - PrEvention of posttraumatic contractuRes with Ketotifen 2 (PERK 2) – protocol for
      a multicenter randomized clinical trial.
LID - 123
AB  - Background: Injuries and resulting stiffness around joints, especially the elbow,
      have huge psychological effects by reducing quality of life through interference 
      with normal daily activities such as feeding, dressing, grooming, and reaching
      for objects. Over the last several years and through numerous research results,
      the myofibroblast-mast cell-neuropeptide axis of fibrosis had been implicated in 
      post-traumatic joint contractures. Pre-clinical models and a pilot randomized
      clinical trial (RCT) demonstrated the feasibility and safety of using Ketotifen
      Fumarate (KF), a mast cell stabilizer to prevent elbow joint contractures. This
      study aims to evaluate the efficacy of KF in reducing joint contracture severity 
      in adult participants with operately treated elbow fractures and/or dislocations.
      Methods/design: A Phase III randomized, controlled, double-blinded multicentre
      trial with 3 parallel groups (KF 2 mg or 5 mg or lactose placebo twice daily
      orally for 6 weeks). The study population consist of adults who are at least
      18 years old and within 7 days of injury. The types of injuries are distal
      humerus (AO/OTA type 13) and/or proximal ulna and/or proximal radius fractures
      (AO/OTA type 2 U1 and/or 2R1) and/or elbow dislocations (open fractures with or
      without nerve injury may be included). A stratified randomization scheme by
      hospital site will be used to assign eligible participants to the groups in a
      1:1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is change in elbow flexion-extension range of
      motion (ROM) arc from baseline to 12 weeks post-randomization. The secondary
      outcomes are changes in ROM from baseline to 6, 24 & 52 weeks, PROMs at 2, 6, 12,
      24 & 52 weeks and impact of KF on safety including serious adverse events and
      fracture healing. Descriptive analysis for all outcomes will be reported and
      ANCOVA be used to evaluate the efficacy KF over lactose placebo with respect to
      the improvement in ROM. Discussion: The results of this study will provide
      evidence for the use of KF in reducing post-traumatic joint contractures and
      improving quality of life after joint injuries. Trial registration: This study
      was prospectively registered (July 10, 2018) with ClinicalTrials.gov reference:
      NCT03582176.

TI  - Effects of combined warmed preoperative forced-air and warmed perioperative
      intravenous fluids on maternal temperature during cesarean section: a
      prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
LID - 48
AB  - Background: Preventing the frequent perioperative hypothermia incidents that
      occur during elective caesarean deliveries would be beneficial. This trial aimed 
      at evaluating the effect of preoperative forced-air warming alongside
      perioperative intravenous fluid warming in women undergoing cesarean sections
      under spinal anesthesia. Methods: We randomly allocated 135 women undergoing
      elective cesarean deliveries to either the intervention group (preoperative
      forced-air and intravenous fluid warming, n = 69) or the control group (no active
      warming, n = 66). The primary outcome measure was the core temperature change
      between groups from baseline to the end of the surgical procedure. Secondary
      outcomes included thermal comfort scores, the incidences of shivering and
      hypothermia (< 36 °C), the core temperature on arrival at the post-anesthesia
      care unit, neonatal axillary temperature at birth, and Apgar scores. Results:
      Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significantly different core temperature
      changes (from the pre-spinal temperature to that at the end of the procedure)
      between groups (F = 13.022, P < 0.001). The thermal comfort scores were also
      higher in the intervention group than in the control group (F = 9.847,
      P = 0.002). The overall incidence of perioperative hypothermia was significantly 
      lower in the intervention group than in the control group (20.6% vs. 51.6%,
      P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Warming preoperative forced-air and perioperative
      intravenous fluids may prevent maternal hypothermia, reduce maternal shivering,
      and improve maternal thermal comfort for patients undergoing cesarean sections
      under spinal anesthesia. Trial registration: The study was registered with the
      Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR1800019117) on
      October26, 2018.

TI  - Effectiveness of supervised early exercise program in patients with arthroscopic 
      rotator cuff repair: Study protocol clinical trial.
LID - e18846
AB  - Background:: Based on the available evidence, it is difficult to make a clinical 
      decision about the best exercise program and to establish the most favorable time
      to start postoperative treatment after rotator cuff (RC) repair. The aim of this 
      trial is to evaluate the effects of adding a supervised early exercise program to
      standard treatment for functional improvement and pain relief compared with
      standard treatment alone in patients with arthroscopic RC repair. Method/design::
      A total of 118 patients between the ages of 18 and 50 years with arthroscopic RC 
      repair will be randomized to 2 treatment arms. The control group will receive a
      standard exercise program based on a consensus statement on shoulder
      rehabilitation developed by the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow
      Therapists. The intervention group will receive a supervised early exercise
      program in combination with standard treatment. This supervised exercise program 
      will be based on electromyographic evidence. Three evaluations will be performed:
      before surgery, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be 
      the shoulder function by the Constant–Murley questionnaire, and the secondary
      outcome measures will be the upper limb function by the disabilities of the arm, 
      shoulder, and hand questionnaire; pain by the visual analog scale; and the
      shoulder range of motion by a goniometer. Discussion:: We hypothesize that
      patients who receive a supervised early exercise program in combination with
      standard treatment will benefit more in respect to shoulder function, pain
      reduction, and range of motion than those who receive a standard exercise
      program. If this is confirmed, our study can be used clinically to enhance the
      recovery of patients with arthroscopic RC repair. Trial registration:: Brazilian 
      registry of clinical trials UTN number U1111-1224-4143. Registered December 18,

TI  - Enhanced External Counterpulsation Efficacy on Exercise Endurance in COPD
      Patients and Healthy Subjects: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - Purpose: Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is popular in China for the
      treatment of coronary heart diseases, but it may be an effective treatment for
      other populations. This study aimed to explore the effect of EECP on exercise
      endurance of healthy people and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      patients and provide intervention measures to improve their physical condition.
      Patients and methods: Patients were enrolled in this pilot randomized controlled 
      trial at Jiangbin Hospital, China, between March 1st and May 30th, 2018. They
      were randomly divided into the EECP and non-EECP groups. According to their
      maximal oxygen uptake, the volunteers were also sub-grouped into the normal, low 
      exercise endurance, and COPD subgroups. Differences in exercise endurance were
      evaluated between the EECP and non-EECP groups before and after treatment.
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testng included anaerobic threshold oxygen uptake
      (AT-VO2Kg), maximum oxygen uptake (Max-VO2Kg), anaerobic threshold pulse
      (AT-O2puls), anaerobic threshold metabolic equivalent (AT-Mets), and maximum
      metabolic equivalent (Max-Mets). Results: 72 volunteers were enrolled. The EECP
      and non-EECP groups were similar in terms of age, sex, body mass index, blood
      pressure, heart rate, breathing frequency, AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg, AT-O2puls,
      AT-Mets, and Max-Mets (P > 0.05) before treatment. EECP significantly improved
      AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg, AT-O2puls, AT-Mets, and Max-Mets compared with the non-EECP 
      group (P<0.05). When analyzed according to sub-groups, the AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg,
      AT-O2puls, AT-Mets, and Max-Mets of the normal, low exercise endurance, and COPD 
      subgroups were all significantly increased after EECP (P<0.05). Conclusion: EECP 
      significantly improved the exercise endurance of normal adults, low endurance
      adults, and COPD patients. Registration number: ChiCTR1900021993.

TI  - A cluster randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      Implementation of Infant Pain Practice Change (ImPaC) Resource to improve pain
      practices in hospitalized infants: a study protocol.
LID - 16
AB  - Background: Hospitalized infants undergo multiple painful procedures daily.
      Despite the significant evidence, procedural pain assessment and management
      continues to be suboptimal. Repetitive and untreated pain at this vital
      developmental juncture is associated with negative behavioral and
      neurodevelopmental consequences. To address this knowledge to practice gap, we
      developed the web-based Implementation of Infant Pain Practice Change (ImPaC)
      Resource to guide change in healthcare professionals’ pain practice behaviors.
      This protocol describes the evaluation of the intervention effectiveness and
      implementation of the Resource and how organizational context influences
      outcomes. Methods: An effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 design, blending
      a cluster randomized clinical trial and a mixed-methods implementation study will
      be used. Eighteen Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) across Canada will be
      randomized to intervention (INT) or standard practice (SP) groups. NICUs in the
      INT group will receive the Resource for six months; those in the SP group will
      continue with practice as usual and will be offered the Resource after a
      six-month waiting period. Data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. To
      address the intervention effectiveness, the INT and SP groups will be compared on
      clinical outcomes including the proportion of infants who have procedural pain
      assessed and managed, and the frequency and nature of painful procedures. Data
      will be collected at baseline (before randomization) and at completion of the
      intervention (six months). Implementation outcomes (feasibility, fidelity,
      implementation cost, and reach) will be measured at completion of the
      intervention. Sustainability will be assessed at six and 12 months following the 
      intervention. Organizational context will be assessed to examine its influence on
      intervention and implementation outcomes. Discussion: This mixed-methods study
      aims to determine the effectiveness and the implementation of a multifaceted
      online strategy for changing healthcare professionals’ pain practices for
      hospitalized infants. Implementation strategies that are easily and effectively
      implemented are important for sustained change. The results will inform
      healthcare professionals and decision-makers on how to address the challenges of 
      implementing the Resource within various organizational contexts. Trial
