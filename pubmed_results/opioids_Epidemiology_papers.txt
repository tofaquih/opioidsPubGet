TI  - Incidence of Opioid Overdose Among Patients Using ER/LA Opioid Analgesics Before 
      and After Implementation of the Class-Wide Opioid Risk Evaluation and Mitigation 
      Strategy.
PG  - 157-69
AB  - Introduction: The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required 
      a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and
      long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics on 09 July 2012. Methods: This study
      compared the incidence of opioid overdose before (July 2010-June 2012) and after 
      (July 2013-September 2016) the initiation of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
      Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics.
      We identified patients with ≥1 ER/LA opioid dispensing in either time period in
      national data from the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and in
      United States (US) Medicaid claims data from four states. We described each
      population, calculated the incidence rate (IR) of opioid overdose, and assessed
      crude and propensity score adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing the
      overdose rate after vs before implementation of the REMS. Results: A total of
      121,229 commercially insured and 11,488 Medicaid patients were included in the
      analysis. Rates of overdose were substantially higher in Medicaid patients than
      in the commercially insured patients (IR 192.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      162.60–225.18 versus 102.60, 95% CI 93.0–112.93 in the active period). The IRRs
      for opioid overdose were 1.01 (95% CI 0.87–1.17) in the commercially insured
      population and 0.70 (95% CI 0.52–0.93) in Medicaid. Conclusion: This leveling off
      of overdose rates among commercially insured patients and decline among Medicaid 
      patients is encouraging, but it is difficult to disentangle the specific impact
      of the REMS from many other ongoing initiatives with similar goals.

TI  - Association between opioid analgesic therapy and initiation of buprenorphine
      management: An analysis of prescription drug monitoring program data.
LID - e0227350
AB  - Background: In the US, medication assisted treatment, particularly with
      office-based buprenorphine, has been an important component of opioid dependence 
      treatment among patients with iatrogenic addiction to opioid analgesics. The
      predictors of initiating buprenorphine for addiction among opioid analgesic
      patients have not been well-described. Methods: We conducted a time-to-event
      analysis using data from the North Carolina (NC) Prescription Drug Monitoring
      Program (PDMP). Our outcome of interest was time-to-initiation of sublingual
      buprenorphine. Our study population was a prospective cohort of all state
      residents receiving a full-agonist opioid analgesic between 2011 and 2015.
      Predictors of initiation of sublingual buprenorphine examined included: age,
      gender, cumulative pharmacies and prescribers utilized, cumulative opioid
      intensity (defined as cumulative opioid exposure divided by duration of opioid
      exposure), and benzodiazepine dispensing. Findings: Of 4.3 million patients
      receiving opioid analgesics in NC between 2011 and 2015 (accumulated 8.30 million
      person-years of follow-up), and a total of 28,904 patients initiated
      buprenorphine formulations intended for addiction treatment (overall rate 3.48
      per 1,000 person-years). In adjusted multivariate models, the utilization of 3 or
      more pharmacies (HR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.82, 3.05) or 6 or more controlled substance 
      prescribers (HR: 12.09; 95% CI: 10.76, 13.57) was associated with buprenorphine
      initiation. A dose-response relationship was observed for cumulative opioid
      intensity (HR in highest decile relative to lowest decile: 5.05; 95% CI: 4.70,
      5.42). Benzodiazepine dispensing was negatively associated with buprenorphine
      initiation (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.65). Conclusions: Opioid analgesic patients
      utilizing multiple prescribers or pharmacies are more likely to initiate
      sublingual buprenorphine. This finding suggests that patients with multiple
      healthcare interactions are more likely to be treated for high-risk opioid use,
      or may be more likely to be identified and treated for addiction. Future research
      should utilize prescription monitoring program data linked to electronic health
      records to include diagnosis information in analytic models.

TI  - Sex Differences in Associations Between CYP2D6 Phenotypes and Response to Opioid 
      Analgesics.
PG  - 71-9
AB  - Background: Several small studies have previously investigated associations
      between the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolism and response to opioids. We
      used a large sample of patients to study associations between CYP2D6 phenotypes
      and estimated CYP2D6 enzymatic activity scores with pain control and adverse
      reactions related to codeine and tramadol use. We conducted additional analyses
      to determine whether our results were consistent among men and women. Methods: We
      used data from 2,877 participants in the RIGHT Protocol who were prescribed
      codeine and/or tramadol between 01/01/2005 and 12/31/2017 and who were not
      prescribed CYP2D6 inhibitors within 1 year prior to the opioid prescription.
      CYP2D6 phenotype categories were condensed into four groups: (1) Ultra-rapid and 
      Rapid (n = 61), (2) Normal and Intermediate to Normal (n = 1,448), (3)
      Intermediate and Intermediate to Poor (n = 1,175), and (4) Poor metabolizer
      status (n = 193). Opioid-related outcomes included indications of poor pain
      control or adverse reactions related to medication use. We modeled the risk of
      each outcome using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, race, and
      ethnicity. Results: The results revealed a trend from poor to ultra-rapid and
      rapid CYP2D6 phenotypes in which the risk of adverse reactions incrementally
      increased and the risk of poor pain control incrementally decreased. This trend
      reached statistical significance among female (but not male) participants. Among 
      normal and intermediate to normal metabolizers, a larger proportion of women
      experienced adverse reactions relative to men. Discussion: We replicated and
      extended the findings of previous research indicating associations between CYP2D6
      phenotypes and response to opioids. In addition, the observed associations were
      stronger in women than in men. We recommend sex differences to be factored in
      future research investigating associations between pharmacogenomics and response 
      to medications.

TI  - Predicting Opioid Use Following Discharge After Cesarean Delivery.
PG  - 118-26
AB  - PURPOSE: Although cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure in the 
      United States, postoperative opioid prescribing varies greatly. We hypothesized
      that patient characteristics, procedural characteristics, or both would be
      associated with high vs low opioid use after discharge. This information could
      help individualize prescriptions. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we
      quantified opioid use for 4 weeks following hospital discharge after cesarean
      delivery. Predischarge characteristics were obtained from health records, and
      patients self-reported total opioid use postdischarge on weekly questionnaires.
      Opioid use was quantified in milligram morphine equivalents (MMEs). Binomial and 
      Poisson regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of opioid use
      after discharge. RESULTS: Of the 233 patients starting the study, 203 (87.1%)
      completed at least 1 questionnaire and were included in analyses (86.3% completed
      all 4 questionnaires). A total of 113 patients were high users (>75 MMEs) and 90 
      patients were low users (≤75 MMEs) of opioids postdischarge. The group reporting 
      low opioid use received on average 44% fewer opioids in the 24 hours before
      discharge compared with the group reporting high opioid use (mean = 33.0 vs 59.3 
      MMEs, P <.001). Only a minority of patients (11.4% to 15.8%) stored leftover
      opioids in a locked location, and just 31 patients disposed of leftover opioids. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of predischarge opioid use can be useful as a tool to
      inform individualized opioid prescriptions, help optimize nonopioid analgesia,
      and reduce opioid use. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the impact of
      implementing such measures on prescribing practices, pain, and functional
      outcomes.

TI  - Association of Formulary Exclusions and Restrictions for Opioid Alternatives With
      Opioid Prescribing Among Medicare Beneficiaries.
LID - e200274
AB  - Question: Are Medicare Part D formulary exclusions and restrictions for opioid
      alternatives associated with increases in opioid prescribing? Findings: Using
      county-level panel data throughout the United States, it was found that for each 
      additional opioid alternative not covered in a county, the rate of opioid
      prescribing increased by 2.2% to 3.7% relative to the mean opioid prescribing
      rate. Formulary restrictions in the form of utilization management strategies and
      high-cost tier placements for opioid alternatives were not associated with
      increases in opioid prescribing. Meaning: The findings of this study suggest that
      lack of coverage of opioid alternatives may encourage higher rates of opioid
      prescribing.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Opioid Cessation.
LID - 180
AB  - The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) and
      overdose-related deaths. However, the genetic basis for the ability to
      discontinue opioid use has not been investigated. We performed a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) of opioid cessation (defined as abstinence from illicit 
      opioids for >1 year or <6 months before the interview date) in 1130 African
      American (AA) and 2919 European ancestry (EA) participants recruited for genetic 
      studies of substance use disorders and who met lifetime Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for OUD.
      Association tests performed separately within each ethnic group were combined by 
      meta-analysis with results obtained from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study.
      Although there were no genome-wide significant associations, we found suggestive 
      associations with nine independent loci, including three which are biologically
      relevant: rs4740988 in PTPRD (pAA + EA = 2.24 × 10−6), rs36098404 in MYOM2 (pEA =
      2.24 × 10−6), and rs592026 in SNAP25-AS1 (pEA = 6.53 × 10−6). Significant
      pathways identified in persons of European ancestry (EA) are related to vitamin D
      metabolism (p = 3.79 × 10−2) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (p =
      2.39 × 10−2). UK Biobank traits including smoking and drinking cessation and
      chronic back pain were significantly associated with opioid cessation using
      GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores. These results provide evidence for genetic
      influences on opioid cessation, suggest genetic overlap with other relevant
      traits, and may indicate potential novel therapeutic targets for OUD.

TI  - PRESCRIPTION OPIOID MISUSE MOTIVE LATENT CLASSES: OUTCOMES FROM A NATIONALLY
      REPRESENTATIVE US SAMPLE.
PG  - e97
AB  - Aims:: Prescription opioid misuse (POM) contributes to a larger opioid crisis in 
      the US and Canada, with over 17,000 US POM-related overdose deaths in 2017. Our
      aims were to 1) identify specific profiles of respondents based on POM motives
      using the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and 2) compare
      profile respondents on sociodemographics, substance use and mental and physical
      health outcomes. Methods:: Analyses included 2017-18 NSDUH respondents with data 
      on POM motives (n= 4,810). POM was defined as prescription opioid use in a way
      not intended by the prescriber, including use without a prescription, in larger
      amounts or more frequently. Nine POM motives for the most recent episode were
      assessed, including “to relieve physical pain” and “to get high”. Latent classes,
      based on POM motives, were estimated. Classes were compared on sociodemographics,
      substance use, physical and mental health outcomes. Results:: Eight latent
      classes were identified (in order of prevalence): pain relief only, relax-pain
      relief, sleep-pain relief, multi-motive, high, experimenter, emotional coping,
      and dependent/hooked. Compared to the pain relief only group, the high and
      multi-motive classes had higher odds of all substance use outcomes, with the
      dependent/hooked class having higher odds on all but one outcome. Six of the
      eight classes had higher odds of past-year mental health treatment and suicidal
      ideation than the pain relief only class. Conclusions:: Screening for pain, pain 
      conditions, problematic substance use and psychopathology are recommended in
      those with any POM. While those in the dependent/hooked, multi-motive, and
      emotional coping classes are most likely to have prescription opioid use
      disorder, screening for opioid use disorder symptoms in all individuals with POM 
      is also warranted.

      Conditions in an Urban Emergency Department.
LID - e200802
AB  - Question: Have emergency department clinicians responded to the opioid epidemic
      through altering opioid prescription rates? Findings: In this cross-sectional
      study of 556 176 emergency department patient encounters and 70 218 opioid
      prescriptions within a single emergency department, yearly prescriptions
      decreased by 66.3% between 2013 and 2018. This decrease was associated with a
      71.1% reduction in the number of opioid prescriptions for musculoskeletal pain
      (back, limb, joint, and neck pain) and lesser, but still marked, decreases for
      fractures and kidney stones. Meaning: Reductions in yearly opioid prescriptions
      across varying indications appear to be aligned with recognition of the opioid
      crisis in addition to national, state, and departmental education guidelines.

TI  - Socioeconomic risk factors for fatal opioid overdoses in the United States:
      Findings from the Mortality Disparities in American Communities Study (MDAC).
LID - e0227966
AB  - Background: Understanding relationships between individual-level demographic,
      socioeconomic status (SES) and U.S. opioid fatalities can inform interventions in
      response to this crisis. Methods: The Mortality Disparities in American Community
      Study (MDAC) links nearly 4 million 2008 American Community Survey responses to
      the 2008–2015 National Death Index. Univariate and multivariable models were used
      to estimate opioid overdose fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). Results: Opioid overdose was an overrepresented cause of death
      among people 10 to 59 years of age. In multivariable analysis, compared to
      Hispanics, Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives had elevated risk (HR =
      2.52, CI:2.21–2.88) and (HR = 1.88, CI:1.35–2.62), respectively. Compared to
      women, men were at-risk (HR = 1.61, CI:1.50–1.72). People who were disabled were 
      at higher risk than those who were not (HR = 2.80, CI:2.59–3.03). Risk was higher
      among widowed than married (HR = 2.44, CI:2.03–2.95) and unemployed than employed
      individuals (HR = 2.46, CI:2.17–2.79). Compared to adults with graduate degrees, 
      those with high school only were at-risk (HR = 2.48, CI:2.00–3.06). Citizens were
      more likely than noncitizens to die from this cause (HR = 4.62, CI:3.48–6.14).
      Compared to people who owned homes with mortgages, those who rented had higher
      HRs (HR = 1.36, CI:1.25–1.48). Non-rural residents had higher risk than rural
      residents (HR = 1.46, CI:1.34, 1.59). Compared to respective referent groups,
      people without health insurance (HR = 1.30, CI:1.20–1.41) and people who were
      incarcerated were more likely to die from opioid overdoses (HR = 2.70,
      CI:1.91–3.81). Compared to people living in households at least five-times above 
      the poverty line, people who lived in poverty were more likely to die from this
      cause (HR = 1.36, CI:1.20–1.54). Compared to people living in West North Central 
      states, HRs were highest among those in South Atlantic (HR = 1.29, CI:1.11, 1.50)
      and Mountain states (HR = 1.58, CI:1.33, 1.88). Discussion: Opioid fatality was
      associated with indicators of low SES. The findings may help to target
      prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts to vulnerable groups.

TI  - The Complex Balance between Analgesic Efficacy, Change of Dose and Safety Profile
      Over Time, in Cancer Patients Treated with Opioids: Providing the Clinicians with
      an Evaluation Tool.
LID - 502
AB  - Background: Scanty data exist on the integration between the analgesic effect of 
      opioids, dose changes, and adverse events in cancer patients. Methods: To provide
      further information on this issue, we analysed data on 498 advanced-stage cancer 
      patients treated with strong opioids. At baseline and three visits (at days 7,
      14, and 21), pain intensity, oral morphine-equivalent daily dose, and the
      prevalence of major adverse events were measured. The proportion of responders
      (pain intensity decrease ≥30% from baseline) and non-responders, as well as of
      patients with low or high dose escalation, was calculated. Results: Pain
      intensity strongly decreased from baseline (pain intensity difference −4.0 at day
      7 and −4.2 at day 21) in responders, while it was quite stable in non-responders 
      (pain intensity difference −0.8 at day 7 and −0.9 at day 21). In low dose
      escalation patients (82.4% at final visit), daily dose changed from 52.3 to 65.3 
      mg; in high dose escalation patients (17.6%), it varied from 94.1 to 146.7 mg.
      Among responders, high dose escalation patients experienced significantly more
      frequent adverse events compared to low or high dose escalation patients, while
      no differences were observed in non-responders. Conclusions: The response to
      opioids results from the combination of three clinical aspects, which are
      strongly interrelated. These results provide some thoughts to help clinical
      evaluations and therapeutic decisions regarding opioid use.

TI  - Prescription Drug Misuse: Taking a Lifespan Perspective.
LID - 1178221820909352
AB  - Prescription drug misuse (PDM), or medication use without a prescription or in
      ways not intended by the prescriber, is a notable public health concern,
      especially in the United States. Accumulating research has characterized PDM
      prevalence and processes, but age-based or lifespan changes in PDM are
      understudied. Given age-based differences in the medical or developmental
      concerns that often underlie PDM, it is likely that PDM varies by age. This
      review summarizes the literature on PDM across the lifespan, examining lifespan
      changes in prevalence, sources, motives and correlates for opioid, stimulant, and
      tranquilizer/sedative (or benzodiazepine) PDM. In all, prevalence rates, sources 
      and motives vary considerably by age group, with fewer age-based differences in
      correlates or risk factors. PDM prevalence rates tend to decline with aging, with
      greater use of physician sources and greater endorsement of self-treatment
      motives in older groups. Recreational motives (such as to get high) tend to peak 
      in young adulthood, with greater use of peer sources or purchases to obtain
      medication for PDM in younger groups. PDM co-occurs with other substance use and 
      psychopathology, including suicidality, across age groups. The evidence for
      lifespan variation in PDM is strongest for opioid PDM, with a need for more
      research on tranquilizer/sedative and stimulant PDM. The current literature is
      limited by the few studies of lifespan changes in PDM within a single sample, a
      lack of longitudinal research, little research addressing PDM in the context of
      polysubstance use, and little research on minority groups, such as sexual and
      gender minorities.

      factors.
LID - e03471
AB  - Interventions are urgently needed to reduce prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors, including anxiety and concomitant use of sedatives. However, only a
      limited number of randomized controlled opioid intervention trials have been
      conducted. We sought to determine whether an online behavior change/support
      community, compared to a control Facebook group, could reduce anxiety and opioid 
      misuse among chronic pain patients. 51 high-risk non-cancer chronic pain patients
      were randomly assigned to either a Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE)
      peer-led online behavior change intervention or a control group (no peer leaders)
      on Facebook for 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria were: 18 years or older, a UCLA
      Health System patient, prescribed an opioid for non-cancer chronic pain between 3
      and 12 months ago, and a score of ≥9 on the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) 
      and/or concomitant use of benzodiazepines. Participation in the online community 
      was voluntary. Patients completed baseline and follow-up assessments on
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder screener (GAD-7), COMM, and frequency of social
      media discussions about pain and opioid use. Compared to control group
      participants, intervention participants showed a baseline-to-follow-up decrease
      in anxiety, and more frequently used social media to discuss pain, prescription
      opioid use, coping strategies, places to seek help, and alternative therapies for
      pain. Both groups showed a baseline to follow-up decrease in COMM score.
      Preliminary results support the use an online community interventions as a
      low-cost tool to decrease risk for prescription opioid misuse and its
      complications.

      USA: Variations in buprenorphine and methadone treatment by geography,

LID - e0229787
AB  - Objective: To identify the geographic, organisational, and payment correlates of 
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment among substance abuse treatment (SAT)
      providers. Methods: Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Substance Abuse 
      Treatment Services (NSSATS) from 2007–16 were conducted. We provide bivariate
      descriptive statistics regarding substance abuse treatment services which offered
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment from 2007–16. Using multiple logistic
      regression, we regressed geographic, organisational, and payment correlates on
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment. Results: Buprenorphine is increasingly
      offered at SAT facilities though uptake remains comparatively low outside of the 
      northeast. SAT facilities run by tribal governments or Indian Health Service
      which offer buprenorphine remain low compared to privately operated SAT
      facilities (AOR = 0.528). The odds of offering buprenorphine among facilities
      offering free or no charge treatment (AOR = 0.838) or a sliding fee scale (AOR = 
      0.464) was lower. SAT facilities accepting Medicaid payments showed higher odds
      of offering methadone treatment (AOR = 2.035). Conclusions: Greater attention
      towards the disparities in provision of opioid agonist therapies is warranted,
      especially towards the reasons why uptake has been moderate among civilian
      providers. Additionally, the care needs of Native Americans facing opioid-related
      use disorders bears further scrutiny.

AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is characterized by compulsive drug taking despite
      adverse life consequences. Here, we sought to identify neurobiological
      consequences associated with the behavioral effects of contingent footshocks
      administered after escalation of oxycodone self-administration. To reach these
      goals, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer oxycodone for 4 weeks 
      and were then exposed to contingent electric footshocks. This paradigm helped to 
      dichotomize rats into two distinct behavioral phenotypes: (1) those that reduce
      lever pressing (shock-sensitive) and (2) others that continue lever pressing
      (shock-resistant) for oxycodone during contingent punishment. The rats were
      euthanized at 2-h after the last oxycodone plus footshock session. The dorsal
      striata and prefrontal cortices were dissected for use in western blot and
      RT-qPCR analyses. All oxycodone self-administration rats showed significant
      decreased expression of Mu and Kappa opioid receptor proteins only in the dorsal 
      striatum. However, expression of Delta opioid receptor protein was decreased in
      both brain regions. RT-qPCR analyses documented significant decreases in the
      expression of c-fos, fosB, fra2, junB, egr1, and egr2 mRNAs in the dorsal
      striatum (but not in PFC) of the shock-sensitive rats. In the PFC, junD
      expression was reduced in both phenotypes. However, egr3 mRNA expression was
      increased in the PFC of only shock-resistant rats. These results reveal that,
      similar to psychostimulants and alcohol, footshocks can dichotomize rats that
      escalated their intake of oxycodone into two distinct behavioral phenotypes.
      These animals also show significant differences in the mRNA expression of
      immediate early genes, mainly, in the dorsal striatum. The increases in PFC egr3 
      expression in the shock-resistant rats suggest that Egr3 might be involved in the
      persistence of oxycodone-associated memory under aversive conditions. This
      punishment-driven model may help to identify neurobiological substrates of
      persistent oxycodone taking and abstinence in the presence of adverse
      consequences.

TI  - Chronic Non-Malignant Pain in Patients with Cancer Seen at a Timely Outpatient
      Palliative Care Clinic.
LID - 214
AB  - Palliative care is seeing cancer patients earlier in the disease trajectory with 
      a multitude of chronic issues. Chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) in cancer
      patients is under-studied. In this prospective study, we examined the prevalence 
      and management of CNMP in cancer patients seen at our supportive care clinic for 
      consultation. We systematically characterized each pain type with the Brief Pain 
      Inventory (BPI) and documented current treatments. The attending physician made
      the pain diagnoses according to the International Association for the Study of
      Pain (IASP) task force classification. Among 200 patients (mean age 60 years, 69%
      metastatic disease, 1-year survival of 77%), the median number of pain diagnosis 
      was 2 (IQR 1–2); 67 (34%, 95% CI 28–41%) had a diagnosis of CNMP; 133 (67%) had
      cancer-related pain; and 52 (26%) had treatment-related pain. In total, 12/31
      (39%) patients with only CNMP and 21/36 (58%) patients with CNMP and other pain
      diagnoses were on opioids. There was a total of 94 CNMP diagnoses among 67
      patients, including 37 (39%) osteoarthritis and 20 (21%) lower back pain; 30
      (32%) were treated with opioids. In summary, CNMP was common in the timely
      palliative care setting and many patients were on opioids. Our findings highlight
      the need to develop clinical guidelines for CNMP in cancer patients to
      standardize its management.

TI  - Stratified analyses of genome wide association study data reveal haplotypes for a
      candidate gene on chromosome 2 (KIAA1211L) is associated with opioid use in
      patients of Arabian descent.
LID - 41
AB  - Background: Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been conducted to
      identify genes and pathways involved in development of opioid use disorder. This 
      study extends the first GWAS of substance use disorder (SUD) patients from the
      United Arab Emirates (UAE) by stratifying the study group based on opioid use,
      which is the most common substance of use in this cohort. Methods: The GWAS
      cohort consisted of 512 (262 case, 250 controls) male participants from the UAE. 
      The samples were genotyped using the Illumina Omni5 Exome system. Data was
      stratified according to opioid use using PLINK. Haplotype analysis was conducted 
      using Haploview 4.2. Results: Two main associations were identified in this
      study. Firstly, two SNPs on chromosome 7 were associated with opioid use
      disorder, rs118129027 (p-value = 1.23 × 10 − 8) and rs74477937
      (p-value = 1.48 × 10 − 8). This has been reported in Alblooshi et al. (Am J Med
      Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet 180(1):68–79, 2019). Secondly, haplotypes on
      chromosome 2 which mapped to the KIAA1211L locus were identified in association
      with opioid use. Five SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (rs2280142,
      rs6542837, rs12712037, rs10175560, rs11900524) were arranged into haplotypes. Two
      haplotypes GAGCG and AGTTA were associated with opioid use disorders (p-value
      3.26 × 10− 8 and 7.16 × 10− 7, respectively). Conclusion: This is the first GWAS 
      to identify candidate genes associated with opioid use disorder in participants
      from the UAE. The lack of other genetic data of Arabian descent opioid use
      patients has hindered replication of the findings. Nevertheless, the outcomes
      implicate new pathways in opioid use disorder that requires further research to
      assess the role of the identified genes in the development of opioid use
      disorder.

TI  - Mobile Peer-Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine
      Learning Tool.
LID - e200001
AB  - Background:: The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not
      receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access 
      to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs
      turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related 
      information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and
      during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery
      programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as
      reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and 
      scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content
      moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or “trolling”); and lack
      common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care. Methods:: This 
      present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile 
      treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure,
      technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. Forty adults
      receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked to pilot a
      smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the “Marigold App”, for a
      duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study to
      obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative
      interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform.
      Anticipated findings and future directions:: The Marigold mobile platform will
      allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to
      different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and
      constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the
      emotional sentiment in messages, automatically “flagging” critical or clinically 
      relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools 
      by adapting them to catch OUD-specific “flags” in peer messages while also
      examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.

TI  - A Review of Scientific Evidence for THC:CBD Oromucosal Spray (Nabiximols) in the 
      Management of Chronic Pain.
PG  - 399-410
AB  - The 20% prevalence of chronic pain in the general population is a major health
      concern given the often profound associated impairment of daily activities,
      employment status, and health-related quality of life in sufferers. Resource
      utilization associated with chronic pain represents an enormous burden for
      healthcare systems. Although analgesia based on the World Health Organization’s
      pain ladder continues to be the mainstay of chronic pain management, aside from
      chronic cancer pain or end-of-life care, prolonged use of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids to manage chronic pain is rarely sustainable. 
      As the endocannabinoid system is known to control pain at peripheral, spinal, and
      supraspinal levels, interest in medical use of cannabis is growing. A proprietary
      blend of cannabis plant extracts containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
      and cannabidiol (CBD) as the principal cannabinoids is formulated as an
      oromucosal spray (USAN name: nabiximols) and standardized to ensure quality,
      consistency and stability. This review examines evidence for THC:CBD oromucosal
      spray (nabiximols) in the management of chronic pain conditions. Cumulative
      evidence from clinical trials and an exploratory analysis of the German Pain
      e-Registry suggests that add-on THC:CBD oromucosal spray (nabiximols) may have a 
      role in managing chronic neuropathic pain, although further precise clinical
      trials are required to draw definitive conclusions.

TI  - Unintentional Drug-related Deaths in Cambridgeshire: A Retrospective
      Observational Study.
LID - e6750
AB  - Background: Drug-related deaths are a growing public health problem in the United
      Kingdom, overtaking road fatalities and homicides in terms of annual deaths. In
      this study, we investigated the causes and circumstances of unintentional
      drug-related deaths occurring in the county of Cambridgeshire, with the objective
      of identifying the prevalence of physical, mental, and social health problems
      within this cohort.Methods: We collected data on the demographics and mental and 
      physical health of, and drugs contributing to, 30 consecutive unintentional
      drug-related deaths recorded by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough County
      Council Coroners in 2017. A retrospective observational study was used, and data 
      were collected by manual extraction from coroners’ files.Results: Social
      isolation was identified as a recurring theme amongst the decedents, although
      homelessness was found in very few cases. Pharmacologically, multiple drug
      toxicity and opioid toxicity were highly prevalent, whilst prescription opioids
      were implicated in more cases than heroin. Chronic pain was also highly prevalent
      amongst the decedents, and a history of mental illness was found to occur in the 
      majority of cases.Discussion: Our findings show that reports from the coronial
      system provide a rich narrative to understand the causes of drug-related deaths. 
      We have identified that individuals who die from drug-related deaths frequently
      have multiple adverse physical, mental, and social problems. This implies that
      any attempt to reduce drug-related deaths requires a multi-faceted and
      multi-disciplinary approach.

TI  - Mining and visualizing high-order directional drug interaction effects using the 
      FAERS database.
LID - 50
AB  - Background: Adverse drug events (ADEs) often occur as a result of drug-drug
      interactions (DDIs). The use of data mining for detecting effects of drug
      combinations on ADE has attracted growing attention and interest, however, most
      studies focused on analyzing pairwise DDIs. Recent efforts have been made to
      explore the directional relationships among high-dimensional drug combinations
      and have shown effectiveness on prediction of ADE risk. However, the existing
      approaches become inefficient from both computational and illustrative
      perspectives when considering more than three drugs. Methods: We proposed an
      efficient approach to estimate the directional effects of high-order DDIs through
      frequent itemset mining, and further developed a novel visualization method to
      organize and present the high-order directional DDI effects involving more than
      three drugs in an interactive, concise and comprehensive manner. We demonstrated 
      its performance by mining the directional DDIs associated with myopathy using a
      publicly available FAERS dataset. Results: Directional effects of DDIs involving 
      up to seven drugs were reported. Our analysis confirmed previously reported
      myopathy associated DDIs including interactions between fusidic acid with
      simvastatin and atorvastatin. Furthermore, we uncovered a number of novel DDIs
      leading to increased risk for myopathy, such as the co-administration of
      zoledronate with different types of drugs including antibiotics (ciprofloxacin,
      levofloxacin) and analgesics (acetaminophen, fentanyl, gabapentin, oxycodone).
      Finally, we visualized directional DDI findings via the proposed tool, which
      allows one to interactively select any drug combination as the baseline and zoom 
      in/out to obtain both detailed and overall picture of interested drugs.
      Conclusions: We developed a more efficient data mining strategy to identify
      high-order directional DDIs, and designed a scalable tool to visualize high-order
      DDI findings. The proposed method and tool have the potential to contribute to
      the drug interaction research and ultimately impact patient health care.

      retrospective cohort study.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Pain is a common and burdensome complication in patients with acute
      stroke. We assessed the impact of impaired communication in stroke patients on
      pain assessment and treatment. Methods: We included 909 (507 male, mean age
      71.8 years) patients admitted to our stroke unit from 01/2015 to 12/2015 in the
      analysis. Patients were assigned to four groups: able to communicate (AC), not
      able to communicate prior to index stroke (P-NAC), due to focal symptoms of index
      stroke (S-NAC), due to a reduced level of consciousness (C-NAC). Pain prevalence,
      documentation of pain and use of analgesics were evaluated. C-NAC patients were
      excluded from analyses regarding analgesic treatment due to relevant differences 
      in patient characteristics. Results: 746 patients (82.1%) were classified as AC, 
      25 (2.8%) as P-NAC, 90 (9.9%) as S-NAC and 48 (5.3%) as C-NAC. Pain was
      documented on the Numeric Rating Scale and in form of free text by nurses and
      physicians. Nurses documented pain more frequently than physicians (p < 0.001).
      Pain prevalence was 47.0% (n.s. between groups). The use of analgesic medication 
      increased from 48.7% in the AC group, to 76.0% in the P-NAC group, and 77.8% in
      the S-NAC group (p < 0.001). Opioid use was significantly more frequent in NAC
      patients (p < 0.001). The response to the treatment was poorly documented with
      significantly lowest rates in S-NAC patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study 
      suggests that post-stroke pain in patients with inability to communicate is not
      attended enough, not systematically assessed and therefore not sufficiently
      treated.

TI  - The National Ambulance Surveillance System: A novel method for monitoring acute
      alcohol, illicit and pharmaceutical drug related-harms using coded Australian
      ambulance clinical records.
LID - e0228316
AB  - Although harmful consumption of alcohol and other drugs (both illicit and
      pharmaceutical) significantly contribute to global burden of disease, not all
      harms are captured within existing morbidity data sources. Indeed, harms
      occurring in the community may be missed or under-reported. This paper describes 
      the National Ambulance Surveillance System, a unique Australian system for
      monitoring and mapping acute harms related to alcohol and other drug consumption.
      Data are sourced from paramedic electronic patient care records provided by
      ambulance services from across Australia. Coding occurs in a purpose-built
      system, by a team of specialised research assistants. Alcohol, and specific
      illicit and pharmaceutical drugs, rather than broad drug classes, are manually
      coded and the dataset is reviewed and cleaned prior to analysis. The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an ongoing, dynamic surveillance system of
      alcohol and other drug-related harms across Australia. The data includes more
      than 140 output variables per attendance, including individual substances,
      demographics, temporal, geospatial, and clinical data (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale
      score, naloxone provision and response, outcome of attendance). The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an internationally unique population-level
      surveillance system of acute harms arising from alcohol and other drug
      consumption. Dissemination of National Ambulance Surveillance System data has
      been used to inform and evaluate policy approaches and potential points of
      intervention, as well as guide workforce development needs and clinical practice 
      at the local and national level. This methodology could be replicated in other
      countries.

TI  - The effect of gestational diabetes mellitus on sufentanil consumption after
      cesarean section: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown that patients with long-term diabetes
      require more opioids after surgery than patients without diabetes. Gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) normally only lasts for a brief period; nevertheless, its
      effect on sufentanil consumption after cesarean section is unknown. Methods: This
      prospective cohort study included two groups: a GDM group (n = 32) and a matched 
      non-GDM (NGDM) group (n = 32). All patients underwent routine combined
      spinal-epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Sufentanil consumption through 
      an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, the frequency of PCA
      requests, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores 6 and 24 h after surgery were
      compared between groups. Results: Sufentanil consumption (μg) 6 h after surgery
      was higher in the GDM group than in the NGDM group (24.0 ± 6.6 vs 20.1 ± 5.7,
      P = 0.023). PCA was used more frequently 6 and 24 h after surgery by the GDM
      group than by the NGDM group (1[0–2] vs 0[0–1], P = 0.001; 6 [1–5] vs 3 [1, 2,
      6–8], P = 0.001, respectively). The VAS score during activity 24 h after surgery 
      was higher in the GDM group than in the NGDM group (5 [2, 3] vs 5 [1, 2],
      respectively, P = 0.03). Conclusion: Pregnant women with GDM require more opioids
      during the immediate postoperative period after cesarean section than those
      without GDM. Clinical trials registration: No. ChiCTR1800016014, ChenYang, May

TI  - 10-kHz High-Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation for Adults With Chronic Noncancer
      Pain: A Health Technology Assessment.
PG  - 1-109
AB  - Background: Chronic pain is costly for patients and for the health care system.
      It negatively affects people's physical, emotional, social, and mental health. We
      conducted a health technology assessment of 10-kHz high-frequency spinal cord
      stimulation (SCS) in adults with chronic noncancer pain that was refractory to
      medical management, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety,
      cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency
      SCS, and patient preferences and values. Methods: We performed a systematic
      literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each 
      included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias and ROBINS-I tools and the quality
      of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
      Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a
      systematic economic literature search. We analyzed the 5-year budget impact of
      publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in Ontario for adults with chronic
      noncancer pain who had already tried other available SCS therapies (up to 1.2
      kHz). To contextualize the potential value of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS, we spoke
      with people who had chronic noncancer pain. Results: We included 5 studies (7
      publications) in the clinical evidence review. Overall, 10-kHz high-frequency SCS
      likely provides reductions in pain intensity and functional disability, and
      improvements in quality of life in people with chronic noncancer pain (GRADE:
      Moderate). As well, patients may reduce their opioid consumption with 10-kHz
      high-frequency SCS (GRADE: Low). The two included economic evaluations found that
      10-kHz high-frequency SCS was cost-saving compared with conventional SCS, but
      neither was applicable to the Ontario context. Owing to limited evidence about
      the effectiveness of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in people who have first tried and
      failed SCS at lower frequencies (up to 1.2 kHz), we did not conduct a
      cost-effectiveness analysis comparing this pathway of care and 10-kHz
      high-frequency SCS for Ontario. Publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS (using
      the Freedom SCS system) in Ontario over the next 5 years would lead to a total
      net cost savings of $0.73 million (ranging from about $0.10 million in year 1 to 
      about $0.21 million in year 5). However, if the province outsourced this therapy 
      using the Senza HF10 SCS system, the total 5-year budget impact would be about
      $8.76 million. The people we spoke with who had chronic noncancer pain reported
      that their pain had a substantial negative impact on their activities and
      emotional well-being. Their direct knowledge of different pain therapies allowed 
      them to provide context and comparisons when they discussed the impact of SCS on 
      their chronic pain. Conclusions: For adults with chronic noncancer pain that was 
      refractory to medical management, 10-kHz high-frequency SCS was effective in
      relieving pain, reducing disability, and improving quality of life. Because there
      was limited evidence about the effectiveness of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in
      people who had first tried and failed SCS at lower frequencies (up to 1.2 kHz),
      we were unable to determine whether 10-kHz high-frequency SCS is cost-effective
      in the Ontario context. We estimate that publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency
      SCS in Ontario would result in cost savings of about $0.10 million to $0.21
      million per year, for a potential total 5-year net cost savings of about $0.73
      million. Although people with chronic noncancer pain knew little about SCS before
      they received it, they reported that it reduced their level of chronic pain,
      leading to improvements in function and their ability to perform activities of
      daily living.

TI  - Prolonged-Release (PR) Oxycodone/Naloxone Improves Bowel Function Compared with
      Oxycodone PR and Provides Effective Analgesia in Chinese Patients with
      Non-malignant Pain: A Randomized, Double-Blind Trial.
PG  - 1188-202
AB  - Introduction: Prolonged-release oxycodone/naloxone (OXN PR), combining an opioid 
      analgesic with selective blockade of enteric µ-opioid receptors, provided
      effective analgesia and improved bowel function in patients with
      moderate-to-severe pain and opioid-induced constipation in clinical trials
      predominantly conducted in Western countries. This double-blind randomized
      controlled trial investigated OXN PR (N = 116) versus prolonged-release oxycodone
      (OXY PR, N = 115) for 8 weeks at doses up to 50 mg/day in patients with
      moderate-to-severe, chronic, non-malignant musculoskeletal pain and
      opioid-induced constipation recruited in China. Methods: A total of 234 patients 
      at least 18 years of age with non-malignant musculoskeletal pain for more than
      4 weeks that was moderate-to-severe in intensity and required round-the-clock
      opioid therapy were randomized (1:1) to OXN PR or OXY PR. The primary endpoint
      was bowel function using the Bowel Function Index (BFI). Secondary endpoints
      included safety, Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), use of analgesic and
      laxative rescue medication, and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D). Results: 
      While BFI scores were comparable at baseline, at week 8 improvements were greater
      with OXN PR vs OXY PR (least squares mean [LSM] difference (95% CI) − 9.1
      (− 14.0, − 4.2); P < 0.001. From weeks 2 to 8, mean BFI scores were in the range 
      of normal bowel function (≤ 28.8) with OXN PR but were in the range of
      constipation (> 28.8) at all timepoints with OXY PR. Analgesia with OXN PR was
      similar and non-inferior to OXY PR on the basis of modified BPI-SF average 24-h
      pain scores at week 8: LSM difference (95% CI) − 0.3 (− 0.5, − 0.1); P < 0.001.
      The most frequent treatment-related AEs were nausea (OXN PR 5% vs OXY PR 6%) and 
      dizziness (4% vs 4%). Conclusion: OXN PR provided clinically meaningful
      improvements in bowel function and effective analgesia in Chinese patients with
      moderate-to-severe musculoskeletal pain and pre-existing opioid-induced
      constipation. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01918098.

TI  - “Dr. Google, I am in Pain”—Global Internet Searches Associated with Pain: A
      Retrospective Analysis of Google Trends Data.
LID - 954
AB  - We aimed to rank the most common locations of pain among Google users globally
      and locally and analyze secular and seasonal trends in pain-related searches in
      the years 2004–2019. We used data generated by Google Trends (GT) to identify and
      analyze global interest in topics (n = 24) related to locations of pain and how
      these progressed over time. We analyzed secular trends and time series
      decomposition to identify seasonal variations. We also calculated the interest in
      all topics with reference to the relative search volume (RSV) of “Abdominal
      pain”. Google users were most commonly interested in “Headache” (1.30 [times more
      frequently than “Abdominal pain”]), “Abdominal pain” (1.00), and “Back pain”
      (0.84). “Headache” was the most frequent search term in n = 41 countries, while
      “Abdominal pain” was the most frequent term in n = 27 countries. The interest in 
      all pain-related topics except “Dyspareunia” increased over time. The sharpest
      increase was observed for “Abdominal pain” (5.67 RSV/year), and “Toothache” (5.52
      RSV/year). Most of the topics revealed seasonal variations. Among pain-related
      topics, “Headache,” “Abdominal pain,” and “Back pain” interested most Google
      users. GT is a novel tool that allows retrospective investigation of complaints
      among Internet users.

TI  - Current Pharmacological Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: A Narrative
      Review.
LID - 25
AB  - Background and Objectives: Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) is one of the
      most common chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. Although it is usually
      characterized by progressive sensory loss, some patients may develop chronic
      pain. Assessment of DSPN is not difficult, but the biggest challenge is making
      the correct diagnosis and choosing the right treatment. The treatment of DSPN has
      three primary objectives: glycemic control, pathogenic mechanisms, and pain
      management. The aim of this brief narrative review is to summarize the current
      pharmacological treatment of painful DSPN. It also summarizes knowledge on
      pathogenesis-oriented therapy, which is generally overlooked in many publications
      and guidelines. Materials and Methods: The present review reports the relevant
      information available on DSPN treatment. The search was performed on PubMed,
      Cochrane, Semantic Scholar, Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases,
      including among others the terms “distal symmetrical polyneuropathy”,
      “neuropathic pain treatment”, “diabetic neuropathy”, “diabetes complications”,
      ”glycaemic control”, “antidepressants”, “opioids”, and “anticonvulsants”.
      Results: First-line drugs include antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) and pregabalin. Second- and third-line 
      drugs include opioids and topical analgesics. While potentially effective in the 
      treatment of neuropathic pain, opioids are not considered to be the first choice 
      because of adverse reactions and addiction concerns. Conclusions: DSPN is a
      common complication in patients with diabetes, and severely affects the quality
      of life of these patients. Although multiple therapies are available, the
      guidelines and recommendations regarding the treatment of diabetic neuropathy
      have failed to offer a unitary consensus, which often hinders the therapeutic
      options in clinical practice.

TI  - Risk factors for pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations in long-term care
      facility residents: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 47
AB  - Background: Older adults who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at
      particularly high risk for infection, morbidity and mortality from pneumonia and 
      influenza (P&I) compared to individuals of younger age and those living outside
      institutional settings. The risk factors for P&I hospitalizations that are
      specific to LTCFs remain poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the
      incidence of P&I hospitalization and associated person- and facility-level
      factors among post-acute (short-stay) and long-term (long-stay) care residents
      residing in LTCFs from 2013 to 2015. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study,
      we used Medicare administrative claims linked to Minimum Data Set and LTCF-level 
      data to identify short-stay (< 100 days, index = admission date) and long-stay
      (100+ days, index = day 100) residents who were followed from the index date
      until the first of hospitalization, LTCF discharge, Medicare disenrollment, or
      death. We measured incidence rates (IRs) for P&I hospitalization per 100,000
      person-days, and estimated associations with baseline demographics, geriatric
      syndromes, clinical characteristics, and medication use using Cox regression
      models. Results: We analyzed data from 1,118,054 short-stay and 593,443 long-stay
      residents. The crude 30-day IRs (95% CI) of hospitalizations with P&I in the
      principal position were 26.0 (25.4, 26.6) and 34.5 (33.6, 35.4) among short- and 
      long-stay residents, respectively. The variables associated with P&I varied
      between short and long-stay residents, and common risk factors included: advanced
      age (85+ years), admission from an acute hospital, select cardiovascular and
      respiratory conditions, impaired functional status, and receipt of antibiotics or
      Beers criteria medications. Facility staffing and care quality measures were
      important risk factors among long-stay residents but not in short-stay residents.
      Conclusions: Short-stay residents had lower crude 30- and 90-day incidence rates 
      of P&I hospitalizations than long-stay LTCF residents. Differences in risk
      factors for P&I between short- and long-stay populations suggest the importance
      of considering distinct profiles of post-acute and long-term care residents in
      infection prevention and control strategies in LTCFs. These findings can help
      clinicians target interventions to subgroups of LTCF residents at highest P&I
      risk.

TI  - Pain relief and improvement in quality of life with 10 kHz SCS therapy: Summary
      of clinical evidence.
PG  - 403-15
AB  - Objective: Chronic pain is a prevalent condition which has a significant effect
      on the lives of those it impacts. High‐frequency 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation
      (10 kHz SCS) has been shown to provide paresthesia‐free pain relief for a wide
      variety of pain indications. This article summarizes the current and emerging
      data as they relate to the clinical use of the therapy in various pain syndromes.
      Methods: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed electronic database
      using keywords related to 10 kHz SCS. The database was queried from 2013 to May
      2019. Articles reporting clinical studies that included human subjects
      permanently treated with 10 kHz SCS (Senza® system) were included in the review. 
      Recent and relevant conference proceedings known to the authors were also
      included. Results: The selected literature demonstrated significant evidence for 
      the efficacy of 10 kHz SCS in treating chronic back and leg pain (CBLP),
      including a randomized, controlled trial as well as prospective and retrospective
      studies. One‐year follow‐up responder rates (pain relief ≥50%) ranged from 60% to
      80%. Other studies and case series showed promising outcomes in specific
      conditions, including nonsurgical refractory back pain, neuropathic limb pain,
      complex regional pain syndrome, chronic widespread pain, chronic pelvic pain, and
      intractable headache. Subgroup analyses also pointed toward the potential of
      10 kHz SCS being successful when low‐frequency SCS has failed. The vast majority 
      of these studies reported improved quality of life (QOL) metrics and/or reduced
      opioid consumption. Conclusions: Level I evidence already exists for the efficacy
      of 10 kHz SCS in treating CBLP, supported by real‐world clinical experience.
      Other studies demonstrate the potential of the therapy across a range of chronic 
      pain etiologies, although larger confirmatory studies are recommended. Overall,
      the literature suggests that the therapy is associated with improved QOL as well 
      as reduced opioid consumption.

TI  - Adjunct low-dose ketamine infusion vs standard of care in mechanically ventilated
      critically ill patients at a Tertiary Saudi Hospital (ATTAINMENT Trial): study
      protocol for a randomized, prospective, pilot, feasibility trial.
LID - 288
AB  - Background: A noticeable interest in ketamine infusion for sedation management
      has developed among critical care physicians for critically ill patients. The
      2018 Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep disruption
      guideline suggested low-dose ketamine infusion as an adjunct to opioid therapy to
      reduce opioid requirements in post-surgical patients in the intensive care unit
      (ICU). This was, however, rated as conditional due to the very low quality of
      evidence. Ketamine has favorable characteristics, making it an especially viable 
      alternative for patients with respiratory and hemodynamic instability. The
      Analgo-sedative adjuncT keTAmine Infusion iN Mechanically vENTilated ICU patients
      (ATTAINMENT) trial aims to assess the effect and safety of adjunct low-dose
      continuous infusion of ketamine as an analgo-sedative compared to standard of
      care in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) for ≥ 24 h.
      Methods/design: This trial is a prospective, randomized, active controlled,
      open-label, pilot, feasibility study of adult ICU patients (> 14 years old) on
      MV. The study will take place in the adult ICUs in the King Faisal Specialist
      Hospital and Research Center (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and will enroll 80 
      patients. Patients will be randomized post-intubation into two groups: the
      intervention group will receive an adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of
      ketamine plus standard of care. Ketamine will be administered over a period of
      48 h at a fixed infusion rate of 2 μg/kg/min (0.12 mg/kg/h) in the first 24 h
      followed by 1 μg/kg/min (0.06 mg/kg/h) in the second 24 h. The control group will
      receive standard of care in the ICU (propofol and/or fentanyl and/or midazolam)
      according to the KFSH&RC sedation and analgesia protocol as clinically
      appropriate. The primary outcome is MV duration until ICU discharge, death,
      extubation, or 28 days post-randomization, whichever comes first. Discussion: The
      first patient was enrolled on 1 September 2019. As of 10 October 2019, a total of
      16 patients had been enrolled. We expect to complete the recruitment by 31
      December 2020. The findings of this pilot trial will likely justify further
      investigation for the role of adjunct low-dose ketamine infusion as an
      analgo-sedative agent in a larger, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.
      Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04075006. Registered on 30 August
      2019. Current controlled trials: ISRCTN14730035. Registered on 3 February 2020.

TI  - The Prevalence and Clinical Implications of Comorbid Back Pain in Shoulder
      Instability: A Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder
      Instability Cohort Study.
LID - 2325967119894738
AB  - Background:: Understanding predictors of pain is critical, as recent literature
      shows that comorbid back pain is an independent risk factor for worse functional 
      and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as well as increased opioid dependence after
      total joint arthroplasty. Purpose/Hypothesis:: The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate whether comorbid back pain would be predictive of pain or self-reported 
      instability symptoms at the time of stabilization surgery. We hypothesized that
      comorbid back pain will correlate with increased pain at the time of surgery as
      well as with worse scores on shoulder-related PRO measures. Study Design::
      Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods:: As part of the Multicenter
      Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder Instability cohort, patients
      consented to participate in pre- and intraoperative data collection. Demographic 
      characteristics, injury history, preoperative PRO scores, and radiologic and
      intraoperative findings were recorded for patients undergoing surgical shoulder
      stabilization. Patients were also asked, whether they had any back pain.
      Results:: The study cohort consisted of 1001 patients (81% male; mean age, 24.1
      years). Patients with comorbid back pain (158 patients; 15.8%) were significantly
      older (28.1 vs 23.4 years; P < .001) and were more likely to be female (25.3% vs 
      17.4%; P = .02) but did not differ in terms of either preoperative imaging or
      intraoperative findings. Patients with self-reported back pain had significantly 
      worse preoperative pain and shoulder-related PRO scores (American Shoulder and
      Elbow Surgeons score, Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index) (P < .001),
      more frequent depression (22.2% vs 8.3%; P < .001), poorer mental health status
      (worse scores for the RAND 36-Item Health Survey Mental Component Score, Iowa
      Quick Screen, and Personality Assessment Screener) (P < .01), and worse
      preoperative expectations (P < .01). Conclusion:: Despite having similar physical
      findings, patients with comorbid back pain had more severe preoperative pain and 
      self-reported symptoms of instability as well as more frequent depression and
      lower mental health scores. The combination of disproportionate shoulder pain,
      comorbid back pain and mental health conditions, and inferior preoperative
      expectations may affect not only the patient’s preoperative state but also
      postoperative pain control and/or postoperative outcomes.

TI  - Significant Quantitative Differences in Orexin Neuronal Activation After Pain
      Assessments in an Animal Model of Sickle Cell Disease.
LID - 5
AB  - Sickle cell disease is a hemoglobinopathy that causes sickling of red blood
      cells, resulting in vessel blockage, stroke, anemia, inflammation, and extreme
      pain. The development and treatment of pain, in particular, neuropathic pain in
      sickle cell disease patients is poorly understood and impedes our progress toward
      the development of novel therapies to treat pain associated with sickle cell
      disease. The orexin/hypocretin system offers a novel approach to treat chronic
      pain and hyperalgesia. These neuropeptides are synthesized in three regions:
      perifornical area (PFA), lateral hypothalamus (LH), and dorsomedial hypothalamus 
      (DMH). Data suggest that orexin–A neuropeptide has an analgesic effect on
      inflammatory pain and may affect mechanisms underlying the maintenance of
      neuropathic pain. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are
      neuronal activation differences in the orexin system as a result of neuropathic
      pain testing in a mouse model of sickle cell disease. Female transgenic sickle
      mice that express exclusively (99%) human sickle hemoglobin (HbSS-BERK) and
      age-/gender-matched controls (HbAA-BERK mice; n = 10/group, 20–30 g) expressing
      normal human hemoglobin A were habituated to each test protocol and environment
      before collecting baseline measurements and testing. Four measures were used to
      assess pain-related behaviors: thermal/heat hyperalgesia, cold hyperalgesia,
      mechanical hyperalgesia, and deep-tissue hyperalgesia. Hypothalamic brain
      sections from HbAA-BERK and HbSS-BERK mice were processed to visualize orexin and
      c-Fos immunoreactivity and quantified. The percentage of double labeled neurons
      in the PFA was significantly higher than the percentage of double labeled neurons
      in the LH orexin field of HbAA-BERK mice (*p < 0.05). The percentages of double
      labeled neurons in PFA and DMH orexin fields are significantly higher than those 
      neurons in the LH of HbSS-BERK mice (*p < 0.05). These data suggest that DMH
      orexin neurons were preferentially recruited during neuropathic pain testing and 
      a more diverse distribution of orexin neurons may be required to produce
      analgesia in response to pain in the HbSS-BERK mice. Identifying specific orexin 
      neuronal populations that are integral in neuropathic pain processing will allow 
      us to elucidate mechanisms that provide a more selective, targeted approach in
      treating of neuropathic pain in sickle cell disease.

TI  - Is marijuana use associated with decreased use of prescription opioids?
      Toxicological findings from two US national samples of drivers.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: State governments in the United States are increasingly viewing
      marijuana legalization as a policy option for controlling the opioid epidemic
      under the premise that marijuana is a less harmful substitute for opioids. The
      purpose of this study is to assess whether marijuana use is associated with
      decreased odds of prescription opioid use. Methods: A cross-sectional study
      design was applied to toxicological testing data from two national samples of
      drivers: 1) the 2011–2016 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and 2) the
      2013–2014 National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers (NRS).
      Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated from
      multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of 
      marijuana use with prescription opioid use and alcohol use. Results: Among the
      47,602 drivers from the FARS, 15.7% tested positive for marijuana and 6.9%
      positive for prescription opioids. Compared with drivers testing negative for
      marijuana, those testing positive for marijuana were 28% more likely to test
      positive for prescription opioids (adjusted OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.15–1.42). Among
      the 7881 drivers from the NRS, 7.9% tested positive for marijuana and 4.5%
      positive for prescription opioids. Relative to drivers testing negative for
      marijuana, those testing positive for marijuana were twice as likely to test
      positive for prescription opioids (adjusted OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.29–3.20). In
      both study samples, marijuana use was associated with significantly increased
      odds of alcohol positivity. Conclusions: Drivers who test positive for marijuana 
      are significantly more likely to test positive for prescription opioids.
      Longitudinal studies with rigorous designs and toxicological testing data are
      needed to further address the substitution hypothesis between marijuana and
      prescription opioids.

TI  - Role of Oxycodone Hydrochloride in Treating Radiotherapy-Related Pain.
LID - 7565962
AB  - Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat cancer patients. Besides the curable
      effect, radiotherapy also could relieve the pain of cancer patients. However,
      cancer pain is gradually alleviated about two weeks after radiotherapy. In
      addition, cancer patients who receive radiotherapy may also suffer from pain
      flare or radiotherapy-induced side effects such as radiation esophagitis,
      enteritis, and mucositis. Pain control is reported to be inadequate during the
      whole course of radiotherapy (before, during, and after radiotherapy), and
      quality of life is seriously affected. Hence, radiotherapy is suggested to be
      combined with analgesic drugs in clinical guidelines. Previous studies have shown
      that radiotherapy combined with oxycodone hydrochloride can effectively alleviate
      cancer pain. In this review, we firstly presented the necessity of analgesia
      during the whole course of radiotherapy. We also sketched the role of oxycodone
      hydrochloride in radiotherapy of bone metastases and radiotherapy-induced oral
      mucositis. Finally, we concluded that oxycodone hydrochloride shows good efficacy
      and tolerance and could be used for pain management before, during, and after
      radiotherapy.

TI  - Design of a randomized controlled trial to Link Infectious and Narcology Care
      (LINC-II) in St. Petersburg, Russia.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: If Russia is to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 HIV targets, better
      approaches to engage, effectively treat, and retain patients in care are needed. 
      This paper describes the protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing 
      the effectiveness of LINC-II, a strength-based case management program for
      HIV-positive people who inject drugs (PWID) to increase rates of HIV viral
      suppression, ART initiation, and opioid abstinence. Methods: This RCT will enroll
      and randomize 240 participants, recruited from a narcology (addiction care)
      hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. Participants are randomized to the
      intervention or control arms. Those in the intervention arm receive: (1)
      strengths-based HIV case management supporting coordinated care; (2) rapid ART
      initiation; and (3) pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder. We will evaluate the
      intervention’s effectiveness compared to standard of care on the following
      outcomes: (1) undetectable HIV viral load at 12 months (primary); (2) initiation 
      of ART within 28 days of randomization; (3) change in CD4 count from baseline to 
      12 months; (4) retention in HIV care (i.e., ≥ 1 visit to medical care in 2
      consecutive 6 month periods); (5) undetectable HIV viral load at 6 months; and
      (6) past 30-day opioid abstinence (at 6 and at 12 months). Discussion: This RCT
      will assess the LINC-II intervention in an urban Russian setting. If effective,
      it will offer a new approach for increasing the uptake of both HIV and opioid use
      disorder treatment and coordination of these modalities in standard Eastern
      European clinical settings.Trial registration This study was registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov through the National Institutes of Health, NCT03290391.

TI  - Applying the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
      framework to determine the predictors of falls and fractures in people with
      osteoarthritis or at high risk of developing osteoarthritis: data from the
      Osteoarthritis Initiative.
LID - 138
AB  - Background: Falls are a major cause of injury and death among older people.
      Evidence suggests that people with osteoarthritis (OA) are at a higher risk of
      falls and fall-related injuries including fractures. While studies demonstrate a 
      link between OA and falls, little is known about the pathways that link falls
      with demographic factors, OA impairments, activity limitations and participation 
      restrictions. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for falls and
      fractures among people with OA or at high risk of developing OA using the
      International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)
      framework. Methods: A longitudinal analysis of data from the Osteoarthritis
      Initiative (OAI) dataset was undertaken. Participants were considered to have OA 
      if they reported they had been diagnosed with knee or hip OA by a medical
      practitioner. Outcomes were self-reported falls and fractures. Potential
      predictors were classified using the ICF framework. Poisson regression models
      were used to determine the risk factors for falls and fractures. Results: Of the 
      4796 participants, 2270 (47%) were diagnosed with knee and/or hip OA. A higher
      proportion of participants with OA reported having had falls (72% vs 63%;
      p < 0.0001) and fractures (17% vs 14%; p = 0.012) than those without OA. Personal
      factors were found to be stronger predictors of falls and fractures compared to
      OA impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions in this
      sample of participants. After adjusting for potential covariates, self-reported
      history of falls was a significant predictor of both increased falls (incidence
      rate ratio [IRR] 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40, 4.60) and fracture risk
      (IRR 1.38; 95% CI 1.13, 1.69). Conclusions: By applying the ICF framework, we
      have shown that personal factors were more likely to predict falls and fractures 
      rather than OA impairments, environmental factors, activity limitations and
      participation restrictions in people with OA or at high risk of developing OA.
      This highlights the importance of questioning patients about their previous falls
      and past medical history, and using this information to focus our assessment and 
      clinical decision-making processes.

TI  - The burden of headache following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a
      prospective single-center cross-sectional analysis.
PG  - 893-903
AB  - Background: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as a serious type of stroke 
      is frequently accompanied by a so-called initial thunderclap headache. However,
      the occurrence of burdensome long-term headache following SAH has never been
      studied in detail so far. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence
      and characteristics of long-term burdensome headache in good-grade SAH patients
      as well as its relation to health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Methods: All 
      SAH cases treated between January 2014 and December 2016 with preserved
      consciousness at hospital discharge were prospectively interviewed regarding
      burdensome headache in 2018. Study participants were subsequently scrutinized by 
      means of a standardized postal survey comprising validated pain and HR-QOL
      questionnaires. A retrospective chart review provided data on the initial
      treatment. Results: A total of 93 out of 145 eligible SAH patients participated
      in the study (62 females). A total of 41% (38/93) of subjects indicated
      burdensome headache at follow-up (mean 32.6 ± 9.3 months). Comparison between
      patients with (HA+) and without long-term headache (HA-) revealed significantly
      younger mean age (47.9 ± 11.8 vs. 55.6 ± 10.3 years; p < .01) as well as more
      favorable neurological conditions (WFNS I/II: 95% vs. 75%; p = .03) in HA+ cases.
      The mean average headache of the HA+ group was 3.7 ± 2.3 (10-point numeric rating
      scale), and the mean maximum headache intensity was 5.7 ± 2.9. Pain and HR-QOL
      scores demonstrated profound alterations in HA+ compared to HA- patients.
      Conclusions: Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of SAH patients
      suffers from burdensome headache even years after the hemorrhage. Moreover,
      long-term headache is associated with reduced HR-QOL in these cases. Electronic

TI  - Pain Assessment in Hemodialysis Patients.
LID - e6903
AB  - BackgroundPain is a common complaint among hemodialysis (HD) patients; however,
      most patients are not assessed for this aspect and are not sufficiently treated. 
      In these patients, pain is reported to be associated with a range of parameters
      like increased depression and disrupted quality of life (QOL). Previously
      residual renal function (RRF) was not assessed for associations with pain. The
      primary aim of the study is to evaluate the pain frequency in the Turkish HD
      patient population. In addition, the type, origin, and severity of chronic pain, 
      the pain treatment ratio, and the relationship between pain, QOL, and RRF were
      investigated during the study.MethodsThis study included 328 HD patients. Pain
      assessment used the McGill Pain Questionnaire and neuropathic pain assessment
      used the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) scale. The
      correlation of pain and quality of life was evaluated with the Short Form 36
      (SF-36) quality of life scale.ResultsOf patients, 244 experienced pain (74.4%),
      and this pain had a neuropathic character in 61.8% of these patients. Patients
      with pain had a longer dialysis duration than those without pain (4.00
      (2.00-8.00), 3.00 (2.00-4.75), p=0.01). The most common site of pain was the
      lower extremities. Pain was observed more often among females and with increasing
      age. Only 36.4% of patients used analgesics. The quality of life of patients with
      pain was found to be lower. The incidence of pain was higher among patients
      without RRF and had more neuropathic character.ConclusionsPain is a significant
      problem for the majority of HD patients and is not effectively managed. To
      increase the quality of life of patients, the care team should regularly question
      pain symptoms, and it should be treated effectively. In this context, RRF should 
      be regularly monitored and efforts should be made to preserve it.

TI  - Compliance of private pharmacies in Uganda with controlled prescription drugs
      regulations: a mixed-methods study.
LID - 16
AB  - Background: Controlled prescription drug use disorders are a growing global
      health challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. Effective supply chain regulations on
      dispensing and stock control are important for controlling this epidemic. Since
      compliance with these regulations in resource-limited countries is poor, there is
      need to understand its predictors in order to reduce the risk of prescription
      drug use disorders. Methods: A mixed-methods study utilizing a structured
      questionnaire and a simulated client guide was undertaken in Kampala and Mbale
      towns in Uganda. The questionnaire recorded self-reported dispensing and verified
      stock control practices and their covariates from 101 private pharmacies. The
      guide recorded actual dispensing practices from 27 pharmacies. Snowball sampling 
      was done to enrich the sample with pharmacies that stock opioids. The mean
      compliance with good dispensing and stock control practices was calculated.
      Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of 
      compliance. Results: The mean compliance with dispensing and stock control
      requirements was 82.9% and 23%, respectively. Twenty percent and 40% of the
      pharmacies dispensed pethidine without a prescription and with invalid
      prescriptions, respectively. Having a pharmacist on duty (OR = 5.17; p = 0.02),
      prior in-service training on narcotics regulations (OR = 3.51; p = 0.04), and
      previous narcotics audits by the regulator (OR = 5.11; p = 0.01) were independent
      predictors of compliance with stock control requirements. Pharmacies with a
      previous history of poor compliance with dispensing requirements were less likely
      to demonstrate good compliance (OR = 0.21; p = 0.01). Conclusions: There is
      suboptimal compliance to controlled prescription drug regulations among Uganda’s 
      pharmacies. A previous history of poor compliance to dispensing requirements
      predicted low compliance in subsequent assessments. Training and regulatory
      audits increased compliance in stock control but not dispensing. Expansion of
      training and audits to more pharmacies and/or incentives for compliance are
      necessary.

TI  - Results of genicular nerve ablation by radiofrequency in osteoarthritis-related
      chronic refractory knee pain.
PG  - 86-95
AB  - Background/aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the medium- to long-term
      effects of radiofrequency (RF) ablation of genicular nerves for chronic
      refractory knee pain due to osteoarthritis (OA). Materials and methods:
      Forty-eight patients who underwent RF ablation of the genicular nerves were
      evaluated retrospectively. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Western Ontario
      and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC index), opioid and
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use score, quality of life score, and 
      treatment satisfaction score were examined at 1, 3, and 6 months after the
      procedure. Results: The mean VAS scores were significantly lower at the 1-, 3-,
      and 6-month evaluations compared with the preoperative values (P < 0.001). A
      significant decrease was observed in the WOMAC index compared with preoperative
      values (P < 0.001). It was found that 66.7% of opioid users and 56.3% of NSAID
      users stopped using medication. No serious complications were encountered during 
      or after the procedure. Conclusion: In chronic refractory knee pain due to OA,
      the application of RF ablation to the genicular nerve is an effective and safe
      treatment option in the medium to long term.

TI  - Cannabis and Cannabinoids in the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases.
LID - e0007
AB  - Chronic pain is a common complaint among patients, and rheumatic diseases are a
      common cause for chronic pain. Current pharmacological interventions for chronic 
      pain are not always useful or safe enough for long-term use. Cannabis and
      cannabinoids are currently being studied due to their potential as analgesics. In
      this review we will discuss current literature regarding cannabinoids and
      cannabis as treatment for rheumatic diseases. Fibromyalgia is a prevalent
      rheumatic disease that causes diffuse pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.
      Treatment of this syndrome is symptomatic, and it has been suggested that
      cannabis and cannabinoids could potentially alleviate some of the symptoms
      associated with fibromyalgia. In this review we cite some of the evidence that
      supports this claim. However, data on long-term efficacy and safety of
      cannabinoid and cannabis use are still lacking. Cannabinoids and cannabis are
      commonly investigated as analgesic agents, but in recent years more evidence has 
      accumulated on their potential immune-modulatory effect, supported by results in 
      animal models of certain rheumatic diseases. While results that demonstrate the
      same effect in humans are still lacking, cannabinoids and cannabis remain
      potential drugs to alleviate the pain associated with rheumatic diseases, as they
      were shown to be safe and to cause limited adverse effects.

TI  - Identifying appropriate outcomes to help evaluate the impact of the Canadian
      Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for Non-Cancer Pain.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: The Canadian Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for
      Chronic Non-Cancer Pain (COG) was developed in response to increasing rates of
      opioid-related hospital visits and deaths in Canada, and uncertain benefits of
      opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Following publication, we developed a
      list of evaluable outcomes to assess the impact of this guideline on practice and
      patient outcomes. Methods: A working group at the National Pain Centre at
      McMaster University used a modified Delphi process to construct a list of
      clinical and patient outcomes important in assessing the uptake and application
      of the COG. An advisory group then reviewed this list to determine the relevance 
      and feasibility of each outcome, and identified potential data sources. This
      feedback was reviewed by the National Faculty for the Guideline, and a National
      Advisory Group that included the creators of the COG, resulting in the final list
      of 5 priority outcomes. Results: Five outcomes were judged clinically important
      and feasible to measure: 1) Effects of opioids for CNCP on quality of life, 2)
      Assessment of patient’s risk of addiction before starting opioid therapy, 3)
      Monitoring patients on opioid therapy for aberrant drug-related behaviour, 4)
      Mortality rates associated with prescription opioid overdose and 5) Use of
      treatment agreements with patients before initiating opioid therapy for CNCP.
      Data sources for these outcomes included patient’s medical charts, e-Opioid
      Manager, prescription monitoring programs and administrative databases.
      Conclusion: Measuring the impact of best practice guidelines is infrequently
      done. Future research should consider capturing the five outcomes identified in
      this study to evaluate the impact of the COG in promoting evidence-based use of
      opioids for CNCP.

      depression in the United States: 2014 through 2019.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: Understanding how patients are treated in the real-world is vital to 
      identifying potential gaps in care. We describe the current pharmacologic
      treatment patterns for the treatment of depression. Methods: Patients with
      depression were identified from four large national claims databases during
      1/1/2014–1/31/2019. Patients had ≥2 diagnoses for depression or an inpatient
      hospitalization with a diagnosis of depression. Patients were required to have
      enrollment in the database ≥1 year prior to and 3 years following their first
      depression diagnosis. Treatment patterns were captured at the class level and
      included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, other
      antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics/sedatives, and antipsychotics. Treatment 
      patterns were captured during all available follow-up. Results: We identified
      269,668 patients diagnosed with depression. The proportion not receiving any
      pharmacological treatment during follow-up ranged from 29 to 52%. Of the treated,
      approximately half received ≥2 different classes of therapy, a quarter received
      ≥3 classes and more than 10% received 4 or more. SSRIs were the most common
      first-line treatment; however, many patients received an anxiolytic,
      hypnotic/sedative, or antipsychotic prior to any antidepressive treatment.
      Treatment with a combination of classes ranged from approximately 20% of
      first-line therapies to 40% of fourth-line. Conclusions: Many patients diagnosed 
      with depression go untreated and many others receive a non-antidepressant
      medication class as their first treatment. More than half of patients received
      more than one type of treatment class during the study follow up, suggesting that
      the first treatment received may not be optimal for most patients.

TI  - Challenges and Opportunities in Preclinical Research of Synthetic Cannabinoids
      for Pain Therapy.
LID - 24
AB  - Cannabis has been used in pain management since 2900 BC. In the 20th century,
      synthetic cannabinoids began to emerge, thus opening the way for improved
      efficacy. The search for new forms of synthetic cannabinoids continues and, as
      such, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive tool for the research 
      and development of this promising class of drugs. Methods for the in vitro
      assessment of cytotoxic, mutagenic or developmental effects are presented,
      followed by the main in vivo pain models used in cannabis research and the
      results yielded by different types of administration (systemic versus intrathecal
      versus inhalation). Animal models designed for assessing side-effects and
      long-term uses are also discussed. In the second part of this review,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of synthetic cannabinoid
      biodistribution, together with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometric
      identification of synthetic cannabinoids in biological fluids from rodents to
      humans are presented. Last, but not least, different strategies for improving the
      solubility and physicochemical stability of synthetic cannabinoids and their
      potential impact on pain management are discussed. In conclusion, synthetic
      cannabinoids are one of the most promising classes of drugs in pain medicine, and
      preclinical research should focus on identifying new and improved alternatives
      for a better clinical and preclinical outcome.

TI  - Cannabis and Pain Treatment—A Review of the Clinical Utility and a Practical
      Approach in Light of Uncertainty.
LID - e0002
AB  - Over the past decade the phenomenon of cannabis as a legitimate form of treatment
      for pain has overwhelmed the medical community, especially in the field of pain. 
      From a status of a schedule 1 substance having no currently accepted medical use 
      and being considered to have high potential for abuse, its use has mushroomed to 
      over 50,000 legal medical users per year in Israel alone. There appear to be many
      reasons behind this phenomenon—medical, sociological, and economical. Thus, what 
      is cannabis? An abusive substance or a medication? Should it be incorporated into
      current biomedical practice, and how should it be administered? Finally, what is 
      the evidence for the beneficial and detrimental effects of cannabis? This article
      reviews and discusses the current literature regarding the beneficial and the
      detrimental effects of medical cannabis in the treatment of pain. We further
      discuss the problems and challenges facing the medical community in this domain
      and offer a practical approach to deal with these challenges.

TI  - Using four different clinical tools as predictors for pain after total hip
      arthroplasty: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 57
AB  - Background: Treatment of postoperative pain remains a significant clinical
      problem, and prediction of patients with a risk of higher postoperative pain
      levels is an important focus. We aimed to identify patients undergoing total hip 
      arthroplasty (THA) with risk of higher pain levels at 24 h postoperatively by
      using four simple and easily available clinical tools. Methods: This prospective 
      observational cohort study included 102 patients having THA at Zealand University
      Hospital in Denmark. The following predictive tools were investigated for
      identifying patients with higher postoperative pain levels at 24 h
      postoperatively, both at rest and during mobilization: preoperative pain by
      peripheral venous cannulation (PVC) (dichotomized according to numerical rating
      scale pain ≤ 2/> 2 (PVC-Low/PVC-High) (primary outcome); the post anesthesia care
      unit (PACU) nurses’ expectations of patients pain levels; patients early pain
      levels at the PACU; and patients own forecast of postoperative pain levels. The
      Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze comparisons between prediction groups.
      For the primary outcome we considered a p-value < 0.01 as statistically
      significant and for other outcomes a p-value of 0.05. Results: We found no
      significant differences between the PVC groups for pain during mobilization at
      24-h postoperatively: PVC-Low: 6 (4–8) (median, (IQR)) versus PVC-High: 7 (5–8)
      (median, (IQR)), p = 0.10; and for pain at rest: PVC-Low 2 (0–3) (median, (IQR)) 
      versus PVC-High 3 (2–5) (median, (IQR)), p = 0.12. Other comparisons performed
      between predictive groups did not differ significantly. Conclusions: In this
      prospective cohort study of 102 THA patients, we did not find that preoperative
      pain by PVC, when using a cut-off point of NRS ≤ 2, were able to predict
      postoperative pain at 24 h postoperatively. Neither did PACU nurses’ prediction
      of pain, patients forecast of pain, nor did maximum pain levels at the PACU.
      Trial registration: Retrospectively registered 20th February 2018 at
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03439566).

TI  - Prevalence and Correlates of Caffeine Use Disorder Symptoms Among a United States
      Sample.
PG  - 4-11
AB  - Background: The DSM-5 recognizes caffeine use disorder as a condition for further
      study, but there is a need to better understand its prevalence and clinical
      significance among the general population.Methods: A survey was conducted among
      an online sample of 1006 caffeine-consuming adults using demographic quotas to
      reflect the U.S. population. Caffeine consumption, DSM-proposed criteria for
      caffeine use disorder, sleep, substance use, and psychological distress were
      assessed.Results: Eight percent of the sample fulfilled DSM-proposed criteria for
      caffeine use disorder. These individuals consumed more caffeine, were younger,
      and were more likely to be cigarette smokers. Fulfilling caffeine use disorder
      criteria was associated with caffeine-related functional impairment, poorer
      sleep, some substance use, as well as greater depression, anxiety, and
      stress.Conclusions: The prevalence of caffeine use disorder among the present
      sample suggests that the proposed diagnostic criteria would identify only a
      modest percentage of the general population, and that identified individuals
      experience significant caffeine-related distress.

TI  - Identification of Serious Adverse Events in Patients with Traumatic Brain
      Injuries, from Prehospital Care to Intensive-Care Unit, Using Early Warning
      Scores.
LID - 1504
AB  - Traumatic brain injuries are complex situations in which the emergency medical
      services must quickly determine the risk of deterioration using minimal
      diagnostic methods. The aim of this study is to analyze whether the use of early 
      warning scores can help with decision-making in these dynamic situations by
      determining the patients who need the intensive care unit. A prospective,
      multicentric cohort study without intervention was carried out on traumatic brain
      injury patients aged over 18 given advanced life support and taken to the
      hospital. Our study included a total of 209 cases. The total number of
      intensive-care unit admissions was 50 cases (23.9%). Of the scores analyzed, the 
      National Early Warning Score2 was the best result presented with an area under
      the curve of 0.888 (0.81–0.94; p < 0.001) and an odds ratio of 25.4 (95%
      confidence interval (CI):11.2–57.5). The use of early warning scores (and
      specifically National Early Warning Score2) can help the emergency medical
      services to differentiate traumatic brain injury patients with a high risk of
      deterioration. The emergency medical services should use the early warning scores
      routinely in all cases for the early detection of high-risk situations.

TI  - Fluoroscopy-Guided Percutaneous Sacroplasty for Painful Metastases at the Sacral 
      Ala.
PG  - 151-6
AB  - Objective: Percutaneous sacroplasty (PSP) is widely used in the clinic for
      osteoporotic sacral insufficiency fractures; however, few reports have described 
      the safety and effectiveness of PSP for painful sacral metastases at the sacral
      ala under fluoroscopy alone. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      fluoroscopy-guided PSP for painful metastases at the sacral ala. Patients and
      Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients (median age, 60.74 ± 12.74 years), with
      a total of 41 metastatic lesions at the sacral ala, were treated with PSP. The
      patients were followed up for periods ranging from 1 month to 30 months (average,
      8.23 ± 6.75 months). The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index
      (ODI), and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) were used to evaluate pain,
      mobility, and quality of life before the procedure and at 3 days and 1, 3, 6, 12,
      and 18 months after the procedure. Results: Technical success was achieved in all
      patients. The minimum follow-up duration was 1 month. The mean VAS scores
      declined significantly from 7.20 ± 0.93 before the procedure to 3.43 ± 1.38 by
      day 3 after the procedure, and was 3.13 ± 1.07 at 1 month, 3.17 ± 1.15 at 3
      months, 2.91± 1.38 at 6 months, and 2.57 ± 1.51 at 12 months after the procedure 
      (P < 0.001). After PSP, analgesic drug administration had been discontinued in 31
      of 35 patients (88.57%). The ODI and KPS also changed after PSP, with significant
      differences between the baseline scores and those at each follow-up examination
      (P < 0.001). Extraosseous cement leakage occurred in 12 cases without any major
      clinical complications. Conclusion: PSP is a safe and effective technique for the
      palliative treatment of painful metastases involving the sacral ala under
      fluoroscopic guidance alone. It can relieve pain, reduce disability, and improve 
      function, and is associated with minimal complications.

TI  - Adaptation for Regulatory Application: A Content Analysis of FDA Risk Evaluation 
      and Mitigation Strategies Assessment Plans (2014–2018) Using RE-AIM.
LID - 43
AB  - Background: Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) are safety programs 
      that U.S. Food and Drug Administration can require to ensure a drug's benefits
      outweigh its risks and can be considered public health interventions. FDA's 2019 
      draft Guidance for Industry on REMS Assessments encourages the development of
      “novel methods for assessing REMS [to] help advance the science of post-market
      assessment of effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies.”Objective: To
      characterize REMS assessment plans using RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, 
      Implementation, Maintenance) framework and identify areas for advancing methods
      for evaluating REMS programs. RE-AIM was selected for its wide application
      evaluating the translation of scientific advances into practice for public health
      impact.Methods: A content analysis of REMS assessment plans (N = 18) and
      measures(n = 540) was conducted for REMS programs approved by FDA between
      1/1/2014–12/31/2018. Eligibility criteria were: a new drug application or
      biologic license application, included FDA-mandated mitigation strategies called 
      elements to assure safe use (ETASU), and represented a single product REMS
      program. Assessment plans were collected from publicly available regulatory
      approval letters from REMS@FDA website. Blinded reviewers categorized each REMS
      assessment measure to a RE-AIM dimension, adjudicated their application (average 
      IRR 75%), and refined the adapted dimensions' definitions. Dimensions were also
      mapped to REMS Assessment guidance categories.Results: The median number of
      assessment measures per REMS assessment plan was 31 (IQR: 21–36). Frequency of
      measures per RE-AIM criteria per REMS program was: Reach (median = 2; IQR: 2–4); 
      Effectiveness (median = 2.5; IQR:1–4); Adoption (median = 3.5; IQR: 2–5);
      Implementation (median = 18; IQR: 15–24); Maintenance (median = 0; IQR: 0–1).
      Adoption (among prescriber, health system agents of implementation) was more
      commonly assessed than Reach (population-attributable number of patients
      affected). Assessment of heterogeneity of Adoption and Reach was generally
      absent. Implementation assessment measures were most common among drugs requiring
      evidence of safe-use conditions before dispensing or administering the drug.
      Patient-level Effectiveness and Maintenance assessments were most common among
      drugs requiring patient monitoring.Discussion: Implementation science frameworks,
      such as RE-AIM, can be applied to characterize REMS assessment measures and
      identify opportunities for standardizing and strengthening their evaluation.
      Methods to measure Maintenance are needed to provide real-world evidence of REMS 
      integration into the healthcare system.

TI  - Relationship Between Pain Reduction and Improvement in Health-Related Quality of 
      Life in Patients with Knee Pain Due to Osteoarthritis Receiving Duloxetine:
      Exploratory Post Hoc Analysis of a Japanese Phase 3 Randomized Study.
PG  - 181-91
AB  - Purpose: This post hoc analysis of a Japanese phase 3 randomized study
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02248480) investigated relationships between
      changes in pain severity and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in
      duloxetine-treated patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Patients and Methods: 
      Patients with knee OA and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average pain score ≥4
      received duloxetine 60 mg/day or placebo for 14 weeks. Spearman rank correlation 
      coefficients were calculated for change in pain severity, as assessed by the BPI,
      and change in HRQoL, as assessed by the items of the (i) 36-item Short-Form
      Health Survey (SF-36; a generic measure of HRQoL) and (ii) Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC; an OA-specific measure of
      HRQoL). Results: After 14 weeks of treatment, there was a significantly greater
      improvement (p<0.001) for duloxetine (n=177) vs placebo (n=176) in BPI average
      pain severity score and significantly greater improvements (p<0.01) for
      duloxetine vs placebo for 5 of the 8 SF-36 domains (including the Role-Physical, 
      Bodily Pain, and Physical Functioning domains) and all 24 individual WOMAC items.
      The correlation between BPI change from baseline and SF-36 item change from
      baseline was statistically significant (p<0.05) for 2 of the 8 SF-36 items
      (Bodily Pain, Physical Functioning) in duloxetine-treated patients. The
      correlation between BPI change from baseline and WOMAC item change from baseline 
      was statistically significant for 22 of the 24 WOMAC items in duloxetine-treated 
      patients. Conclusion: This post hoc analysis suggested that the pain reduction
      observed in duloxetine-treated patients with knee OA was associated with
      improvements in OA-specific aspects of HRQoL, ie, pain and physical functioning.

TI  - Chronotherapy of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs May Enhance Postoperative 
      Recovery.
LID - 468
AB  - Postoperative pain relief is crucial for full recovery. With the ongoing opioid
      epidemic and the insufficient effect of acetaminophen on severe pain;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are heavily used to alleviate this
      pain. However, NSAIDs are known to inhibit postoperative healing of connective
      tissues by inhibiting prostaglandin signaling. Pain intensity, inflammatory
      mediators associated with wound healing and the pharmacological action of NSAIDs 
      vary throughout the day due to the circadian rhythm regulated by the clock genes.
      According to this rhythm, most of wound healing mediators and connective tissue
      formation occurs during the resting phase, while pain, inflammation and tissue
      resorption occur during the active period of the day. Here we show, in a murine
      tibia fracture surgical model, that NSAIDs are most effective in managing
      postoperative pain, healing and recovery when drug administration is limited to
      the active phase of the circadian rhythm. Limiting NSAID treatment to the active 
      phase of the circadian rhythm resulted in overexpression of circadian clock
      genes, such as Period 2 (Per2) at the healing callus, and increased serum levels 
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-13 (IL-13), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and
      vascular endothelial growth factor. By contrast, NSAID administration during the 
      resting phase resulted in severe bone healing impairment.

TI  - Predicting Opioid Use Following Discharge After Cesarean Delivery.
PG  - 118-26
AB  - PURPOSE: Although cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure in the 
      United States, postoperative opioid prescribing varies greatly. We hypothesized
      that patient characteristics, procedural characteristics, or both would be
      associated with high vs low opioid use after discharge. This information could
      help individualize prescriptions. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we
      quantified opioid use for 4 weeks following hospital discharge after cesarean
      delivery. Predischarge characteristics were obtained from health records, and
      patients self-reported total opioid use postdischarge on weekly questionnaires.
      Opioid use was quantified in milligram morphine equivalents (MMEs). Binomial and 
      Poisson regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of opioid use
      after discharge. RESULTS: Of the 233 patients starting the study, 203 (87.1%)
      completed at least 1 questionnaire and were included in analyses (86.3% completed
      all 4 questionnaires). A total of 113 patients were high users (>75 MMEs) and 90 
      patients were low users (≤75 MMEs) of opioids postdischarge. The group reporting 
      low opioid use received on average 44% fewer opioids in the 24 hours before
      discharge compared with the group reporting high opioid use (mean = 33.0 vs 59.3 
      MMEs, P <.001). Only a minority of patients (11.4% to 15.8%) stored leftover
      opioids in a locked location, and just 31 patients disposed of leftover opioids. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of predischarge opioid use can be useful as a tool to
      inform individualized opioid prescriptions, help optimize nonopioid analgesia,
      and reduce opioid use. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the impact of
      implementing such measures on prescribing practices, pain, and functional
      outcomes.

TI  - Applying the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
      framework to determine the predictors of falls and fractures in people with
      osteoarthritis or at high risk of developing osteoarthritis: data from the
      Osteoarthritis Initiative.
LID - 138
AB  - Background: Falls are a major cause of injury and death among older people.
      Evidence suggests that people with osteoarthritis (OA) are at a higher risk of
      falls and fall-related injuries including fractures. While studies demonstrate a 
      link between OA and falls, little is known about the pathways that link falls
      with demographic factors, OA impairments, activity limitations and participation 
      restrictions. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for falls and
      fractures among people with OA or at high risk of developing OA using the
      International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)
      framework. Methods: A longitudinal analysis of data from the Osteoarthritis
      Initiative (OAI) dataset was undertaken. Participants were considered to have OA 
      if they reported they had been diagnosed with knee or hip OA by a medical
      practitioner. Outcomes were self-reported falls and fractures. Potential
      predictors were classified using the ICF framework. Poisson regression models
      were used to determine the risk factors for falls and fractures. Results: Of the 
      4796 participants, 2270 (47%) were diagnosed with knee and/or hip OA. A higher
      proportion of participants with OA reported having had falls (72% vs 63%;
      p < 0.0001) and fractures (17% vs 14%; p = 0.012) than those without OA. Personal
      factors were found to be stronger predictors of falls and fractures compared to
      OA impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions in this
      sample of participants. After adjusting for potential covariates, self-reported
      history of falls was a significant predictor of both increased falls (incidence
      rate ratio [IRR] 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40, 4.60) and fracture risk
      (IRR 1.38; 95% CI 1.13, 1.69). Conclusions: By applying the ICF framework, we
      have shown that personal factors were more likely to predict falls and fractures 
      rather than OA impairments, environmental factors, activity limitations and
      participation restrictions in people with OA or at high risk of developing OA.
      This highlights the importance of questioning patients about their previous falls
      and past medical history, and using this information to focus our assessment and 
      clinical decision-making processes.

TI  - ALDH2 Gene: Its Effects on the Neuropsychological Functions in Patients with
      Opioid Use Disorder Undergoing Methadone Maintenance Treatment.
PG  - 136-44
AB  - Objective: Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) have impaired attention,
      inhibition control, and memory function. The aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2 )
      gene has been associated with OUD and ALDH2 gene polymorphisms may affect
      aldehyde metabolism and cognitive function in other substance use disorder.
      Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether ALDH2 genotypes have significant
      effects on neuropsychological functions in OUD patients undergoing methadone
      maintenance therapy (MMT). Methods: OUD patients undergoing MMT were investigated
      and followed-up for 12 weeks. ALDH2 gene polymorphisms were genotyped. Connors’
      Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R)
      were administered at baseline and after 12 weeks of MMT. Multivariate linear
      regressions and generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to examine the 
      correlation between the ALDH2 genotypes and performance on the CPTs and WMS-R.
      Results: We enrolled 86 patients at baseline; 61 patients completed the
      end-of-study assessments. The GEE analysis showed that, after the 12 weeks of
      MMT, OUD patients with the ALDH2 *1/*2+*2/*2 (ALDH2 inactive) genotypes had
      significantly higher commission error T-scores (p = 0.03), significantly lower
      hit reaction time T-scores (p = 0.04), and significantly lower WMS-R visual
      memory index scores (p = 0.03) than did patients with the ALDH2 1 */*1 (ALDH2
      active) genotype. Conclusion: OUD patients with the ALDH2 inactive genotypes
      performed worse in cognitive domains of attention, impulse control, and memory
      than did those with the ALDH2 active genotype. We conclude that the ALDH2 gene is
      important in OUD and is associated with neuropsychological performance after MMT.

TI  - Motivations for crystal methamphetamine-opioid co-injection/co-use amongst
      community-recruited people who inject drugs: a qualitative study.
LID - 14
AB  - Aims: We report on motivations for crystal methamphetamine-opioid
      co-use/co-injection through narratives of people who inject drugs during a period
      of increased crystal methamphetamine use reporting in Australia. Methods:
      Fourteen in-depth interviews were undertaken with selected participants (12 male,
      2 female) from the Melbourne Injecting Drug User Cohort Study, including those in
      and out of opioid substitution therapy (OST). Results: The main motivations for
      co-use reported by participants were as follows: (1) that heroin could be used to
      reduce the negative side effects of heavy crystal methamphetamine use,
      particularly during the ‘comedown’ phase; (2) that small quantities of crystal
      methamphetamine used with heroin could prolong the intoxication effect of heroin,
      and hence the time before opioid withdrawal; (3) that co-injection of crystal
      methamphetamine and heroin produced a more desirable intoxication effect than
      using either substance on its own and; (4) that crystal methamphetamine provided 
      a substitute ‘high’ for heroin after commencing OST treatment. Conclusions:
      Co-use of methamphetamine and opioids has been used by people who inject drugs to
      facilitate intoxication, sometimes as the result of ineffective opioid
      substitution therapy (OST) treatment and perceived lack of pleasure after
      stabilisation on OST treatment.

TI  - Promoting Reproducible Research for Characterizing Nonmedical Use of Medications 
      Through Data Annotation: Description of a Twitter Corpus and Guidelines.
LID - e15861
AB  - Background: Social media data are being increasingly used for population-level
      health research because it provides near real-time access to large volumes of
      consumer-generated data. Recently, a number of studies have explored the
      possibility of using social media data, such as from Twitter, for monitoring
      prescription medication abuse. However, there is a paucity of annotated data or
      guidelines for data characterization that discuss how information related to
      abuse-prone medications is presented on Twitter. Objective: This study discusses 
      the creation of an annotated corpus suitable for training supervised
      classification algorithms for the automatic classification of medication
      abuse–related chatter. The annotation strategies used for improving
      interannotator agreement (IAA), a detailed annotation guideline, and machine
      learning experiments that illustrate the utility of the annotated corpus are also
      described. Methods: We employed an iterative annotation strategy, with
      interannotator discussions held and updates made to the annotation guidelines at 
      each iteration to improve IAA for the manual annotation task. Using the grounded 
      theory approach, we first characterized tweets into fine-grained categories and
      then grouped them into 4 broad classes—abuse or misuse, personal consumption,
      mention, and unrelated. After the completion of manual annotations, we
      experimented with several machine learning algorithms to illustrate the utility
      of the corpus and generate baseline performance metrics for automatic
      classification on these data. Results: Our final annotated set consisted of
      16,443 tweets mentioning at least 20 abuse-prone medications including opioids,
      benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, central nervous system stimulants, and 
      gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs. Our final overall IAA was 0.86 (Cohen kappa),
      which represents high agreement. The manual annotation process revealed the
      variety of ways in which prescription medication misuse or abuse is discussed on 
      Twitter, including expressions indicating coingestion, nonmedical use,
      nonstandard route of intake, and consumption above the prescribed doses. Among
      machine learning classifiers, support vector machines obtained the highest
      automatic classification accuracy of 73.00% (95% CI 71.4-74.5) over the test set 
      (n=3271). Conclusions: Our manual analysis and annotations of a large number of
      tweets have revealed types of information posted on Twitter about a set of
      abuse-prone prescription medications and their distributions. In the interests of
      reproducible and community-driven research, we have made our detailed annotation 
      guidelines and the training data for the classification experiments publicly
      available, and the test data will be used in future shared tasks.

TI  - Identification and Management of Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity After
      Traumatic Brain Injury.
LID - 81
AB  - Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) has predominantly been described after
      traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is associated with hyperthermia,
      hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, dystonia (hypertonia or
      spasticity), and even motor features such as extensor/flexion posturing. Despite 
      the pathophysiology of PSH not being completely understood, most researchers
      gradually agree that PSH is driven by the loss of the inhibition of excitation in
      the sympathetic nervous system without parasympathetic involvement. Recently,
      advances in the clinical and diagnostic features of PSH in TBI patients have
      reached a broad clinical consensus in many neurology departments. These advances 
      should provide a more unanimous foundation for the systematic research on this
      clinical syndrome and its clear management. Clinically, a great deal of attention
      has been paid to the definition and diagnostic criteria, epidemiology and
      pathophysiology, symptomatic treatment, and prevention and control of secondary
      brain injury of PSH in TBI patients. Potential benefits of treatment for PSH may 
      result from the three main goals: eliminating predisposing causes, mitigating
      excessive sympathetic outflow, and supportive therapy. However, individual
      pathophysiological differences, therapeutic responses and outcomes, and precision
      medicine approaches to PSH management are varied and inconsistent between
      studies. Further, many potential therapeutic drugs might suppress manifestations 
      of PSH in the process of TBI treatment. The purpose of this review is to present 
      current and comprehensive studies of the identification of PSH after TBI in the
      early stage and provide a framework for symptomatic management of TBI patients
      with PSH.

TI  - Adaptation for Regulatory Application: A Content Analysis of FDA Risk Evaluation 
      and Mitigation Strategies Assessment Plans (2014–2018) Using RE-AIM.
LID - 43
AB  - Background: Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) are safety programs 
      that U.S. Food and Drug Administration can require to ensure a drug's benefits
      outweigh its risks and can be considered public health interventions. FDA's 2019 
      draft Guidance for Industry on REMS Assessments encourages the development of
      “novel methods for assessing REMS [to] help advance the science of post-market
      assessment of effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies.”Objective: To
      characterize REMS assessment plans using RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, 
      Implementation, Maintenance) framework and identify areas for advancing methods
      for evaluating REMS programs. RE-AIM was selected for its wide application
      evaluating the translation of scientific advances into practice for public health
      impact.Methods: A content analysis of REMS assessment plans (N = 18) and
      measures(n = 540) was conducted for REMS programs approved by FDA between
      1/1/2014–12/31/2018. Eligibility criteria were: a new drug application or
      biologic license application, included FDA-mandated mitigation strategies called 
      elements to assure safe use (ETASU), and represented a single product REMS
      program. Assessment plans were collected from publicly available regulatory
      approval letters from REMS@FDA website. Blinded reviewers categorized each REMS
      assessment measure to a RE-AIM dimension, adjudicated their application (average 
      IRR 75%), and refined the adapted dimensions' definitions. Dimensions were also
      mapped to REMS Assessment guidance categories.Results: The median number of
      assessment measures per REMS assessment plan was 31 (IQR: 21–36). Frequency of
      measures per RE-AIM criteria per REMS program was: Reach (median = 2; IQR: 2–4); 
      Effectiveness (median = 2.5; IQR:1–4); Adoption (median = 3.5; IQR: 2–5);
      Implementation (median = 18; IQR: 15–24); Maintenance (median = 0; IQR: 0–1).
      Adoption (among prescriber, health system agents of implementation) was more
      commonly assessed than Reach (population-attributable number of patients
      affected). Assessment of heterogeneity of Adoption and Reach was generally
      absent. Implementation assessment measures were most common among drugs requiring
      evidence of safe-use conditions before dispensing or administering the drug.
      Patient-level Effectiveness and Maintenance assessments were most common among
      drugs requiring patient monitoring.Discussion: Implementation science frameworks,
      such as RE-AIM, can be applied to characterize REMS assessment measures and
      identify opportunities for standardizing and strengthening their evaluation.
      Methods to measure Maintenance are needed to provide real-world evidence of REMS 
      integration into the healthcare system.

TI  - Music Use for Sedation in Critically ill Children (MUSiCC trial): study protocol 
      for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
LID - 31
AB  - Background: Stress induced by pain and anxiety is common in pediatric intensive
      care unit (PICU) patients. Sedation/analgesia in PICU is usually achieved through
      various analgesics and sedatives. Excessive use of these drugs can put patients
      at risk for hemodynamic/respiratory instability, prolonged ventilation,
      withdrawal, delirium, and critical illness polyneuromyopathy.The use of
      non-pharmacologic interventions has been recommended by sedation guidelines.
      However, non-pharmacological measures in PICU, including music and noise
      reduction, have been inadequately studied. Methods: The Music Use for Sedation in
      Critically ill Children (MUSiCC trial) pilot study is an investigator-initiated, 
      three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the use of music for sedation in 
      PICU. The main goal of the study is to demonstrate feasibility of a music trial
      in PICU and to obtain the necessary information to plan a larger trial. The study
      compares music versus noise cancelation versus control in sedated and
      mechanically ventilated children admitted to PICU. In the music group, children
      receive the music (modified classical music) three times a day for 30 min at a
      time. Music is delivered with noise cancelation headphones. The noise cancelation
      group receives the same intervention but with a no music (sham playlist). The
      control group receives usual care with no specific intervention. Children remain 
      in the study until extubation or a maximum of 7 days. The primary outcomes of the
      study are feasibility and sedation/analgesia requirements. Secondary outcomes
      include change in vital signs before and during the intervention, ICU delirium,
      and adverse effects related to the intervention. The estimated sample size is 20 
      subjects per group for a total of 60 children. Discussion: Despite being
      recommended by current guidelines, evidence to support the use of music in PICU
      is lacking. Music has the potential to reduce sedation requirements and their
      negative side effects. This pilot RCT will demonstrate feasibility and provide
      the necessary information to plan a larger trial focusing on the effectiveness of
      the intervention. Trial registration: The study was registered at
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03497559) on April 13, 2018.

TI  - PrEvention of posttraumatic contractuRes with Ketotifen 2 (PERK 2) – protocol for
      a multicenter randomized clinical trial.
LID - 123
AB  - Background: Injuries and resulting stiffness around joints, especially the elbow,
      have huge psychological effects by reducing quality of life through interference 
      with normal daily activities such as feeding, dressing, grooming, and reaching
      for objects. Over the last several years and through numerous research results,
      the myofibroblast-mast cell-neuropeptide axis of fibrosis had been implicated in 
      post-traumatic joint contractures. Pre-clinical models and a pilot randomized
      clinical trial (RCT) demonstrated the feasibility and safety of using Ketotifen
      Fumarate (KF), a mast cell stabilizer to prevent elbow joint contractures. This
      study aims to evaluate the efficacy of KF in reducing joint contracture severity 
      in adult participants with operately treated elbow fractures and/or dislocations.
      Methods/design: A Phase III randomized, controlled, double-blinded multicentre
      trial with 3 parallel groups (KF 2 mg or 5 mg or lactose placebo twice daily
      orally for 6 weeks). The study population consist of adults who are at least
      18 years old and within 7 days of injury. The types of injuries are distal
      humerus (AO/OTA type 13) and/or proximal ulna and/or proximal radius fractures
      (AO/OTA type 2 U1 and/or 2R1) and/or elbow dislocations (open fractures with or
      without nerve injury may be included). A stratified randomization scheme by
      hospital site will be used to assign eligible participants to the groups in a
      1:1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is change in elbow flexion-extension range of
      motion (ROM) arc from baseline to 12 weeks post-randomization. The secondary
      outcomes are changes in ROM from baseline to 6, 24 & 52 weeks, PROMs at 2, 6, 12,
      24 & 52 weeks and impact of KF on safety including serious adverse events and
      fracture healing. Descriptive analysis for all outcomes will be reported and
      ANCOVA be used to evaluate the efficacy KF over lactose placebo with respect to
      the improvement in ROM. Discussion: The results of this study will provide
      evidence for the use of KF in reducing post-traumatic joint contractures and
      improving quality of life after joint injuries. Trial registration: This study
      was prospectively registered (July 10, 2018) with ClinicalTrials.gov reference:
      NCT03582176.

TI  - Trajectory of migraine-related disability following long-term treatment with
      lasmiditan: results of the GLADIATOR study.
LID - 20
AB  - Background: Migraine is recognized as the second leading cause of disability
      globally. Lasmiditan is a novel, selective serotonin 5-HT1F receptor agonist
      developed for acute treatment of migraine. Here we analyzed effects of lasmiditan
      on migraine disability assessed with the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS)
      scale for interim data from a long-term safety study. Methods: Completers of two 
      single-attack parent studies were offered participation in the 1 year GLADIATOR
      study, that randomized participants to treatment with lasmiditan 100 mg or 200 mg
      taken as needed for migraine attacks of at least moderate severity. Changes in
      MIDAS were modeled using a mixed model repeated measures analysis. Results: The
      sample included 1978 patients who received ≥1 lasmiditan dose and were followed
      for a median of 288 days. Baseline mean MIDAS scores for the lasmiditan 100-mg
      and 200-mg groups were 29.4 and 28.9, respectively, indicating severe
      migraine-related disability. Relative to baseline, MIDAS total scores were
      significantly lower at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months for both dose groups. At 12 months,
      changes in MIDAS scores were − 12.5 and − 12.2 for lasmiditan 100 mg and 200 mg, 
      respectively, with 49% and 53% of patients, respectively, achieving at least a
      50% decrease in MIDAS total score. Statistically significant improvements were
      also seen for work and/or school absenteeism and presenteeism, monthly headache
      days, and mean headache pain intensity at all time points up to 1 year. Findings 
      for patients who completed all visits versus those dropping out early were
      similar. Responses were generally similar for the lasmiditan 100 mg or 200 mg
      doses, between subgroups defined based on the number of baseline monthly migraine
      attacks (≤5 vs. >5), and also between subgroups defined by pain-free response
      (yes/no) during initial attacks. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with lasmiditan
      was associated with significant reductions in migraine-related disability,
      including both work or school absenteeism and presenteeism. The similarity of
      responses in completers and those who dropped out suggests that selective
      attrition does not account for the improvements. Benefits were significant at
      3 months and maintained through 12 months. Trial registration:

TI  - Benzodiazepines in the oral fluid of Spanish drivers.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Driving under the influence of alcohol, illicit drugs and certain
      medicines is not allowed worldwide. Roadside drug testing is considered an
      important tool for determining such behavior. In Spain, mandatory roadside oral
      fluid drug testing is carried out regularly. The aim of this study was to
      determine the prevalence of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepines in combination
      with other drugs in drivers, examine benzodiazepine concentrations in drivers,
      and analyze the association of these factors with age and sex. Methods: This
      study assessed data on Spanish drivers with confirmed drug-positive results
      recorded by the Spanish National Traffic Agency (Dirección General de Tráfico)
      between 2011 and 2016, accounting for 179,645 tests and 65,244 confirmed
      drug-positive tests. Results: Benzodiazepines were confirmed in 4.3% of all
      positive roadside drug tests. In most of those cases (97.1%), other substances
      were also detected, particularly cocaine (75.3%) and cannabis (64.0%). The
      frequency of benzodiazepine-positive drivers (OR, 1.094; 95% CI, 1.088–1.100)
      increased with age, while the frequency of drivers who tested positive for
      benzodiazepines in conjunction with other substances, compared with drivers who
      tested positive for benzodiazepines alone, decreased with age (OR, 0.903; 95% CI,
      0.825–0.988). Nordiazepam (54.8%) and alprazolam (46.9%) were the most common
      benzodiazepines detected. Conclusion: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and
      other psychoactive substances was found to be a common behavior among drivers who
      tested positive on the road. It is important to raise awareness of all those
      involved in the consumption of driving-impairing substances (authorities,
      healthcare providers, patients and their families, etc.): roadside detection of
      driving-impairing substances is suggested, in addition to promoting the use of
      fewer driving-impairing medications and the provision of clear information to
      patients.

TI  - Pain relief and improvement in quality of life with 10 kHz SCS therapy: Summary
      of clinical evidence.
PG  - 403-15
AB  - Objective: Chronic pain is a prevalent condition which has a significant effect
      on the lives of those it impacts. High‐frequency 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation
      (10 kHz SCS) has been shown to provide paresthesia‐free pain relief for a wide
      variety of pain indications. This article summarizes the current and emerging
      data as they relate to the clinical use of the therapy in various pain syndromes.
      Methods: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed electronic database
      using keywords related to 10 kHz SCS. The database was queried from 2013 to May
      2019. Articles reporting clinical studies that included human subjects
      permanently treated with 10 kHz SCS (Senza® system) were included in the review. 
      Recent and relevant conference proceedings known to the authors were also
      included. Results: The selected literature demonstrated significant evidence for 
      the efficacy of 10 kHz SCS in treating chronic back and leg pain (CBLP),
      including a randomized, controlled trial as well as prospective and retrospective
      studies. One‐year follow‐up responder rates (pain relief ≥50%) ranged from 60% to
      80%. Other studies and case series showed promising outcomes in specific
      conditions, including nonsurgical refractory back pain, neuropathic limb pain,
      complex regional pain syndrome, chronic widespread pain, chronic pelvic pain, and
      intractable headache. Subgroup analyses also pointed toward the potential of
      10 kHz SCS being successful when low‐frequency SCS has failed. The vast majority 
      of these studies reported improved quality of life (QOL) metrics and/or reduced
      opioid consumption. Conclusions: Level I evidence already exists for the efficacy
      of 10 kHz SCS in treating CBLP, supported by real‐world clinical experience.
      Other studies demonstrate the potential of the therapy across a range of chronic 
      pain etiologies, although larger confirmatory studies are recommended. Overall,
      the literature suggests that the therapy is associated with improved QOL as well 
      as reduced opioid consumption.

TI  - Identification of MOR-Positive B Cell as Possible Innovative Biomarker (Mu
      Lympho-Marker) for Chronic Pain Diagnosis in Patients with Fibromyalgia and
      Osteoarthritis Diseases †.
LID - 1499
AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) diagnosis follows the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
      criteria, based on clinical evaluation and written questionnaires without any
      objective diagnostic tool. The lack of specific biomarkers is a tragic aspect for
      FM and chronic pain diseases in general. Interestingly, the endogenous opioid
      system is close to the immune one because of the expression of opioid receptors
      on lymphocytes membrane. Here we analyzed the role of the Mu opioid receptor on B
      lymphocytes as a specific biomarker for FM and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. We
      enrolled three groups of females: FM patients, OA patients (chronic pain control 
      group) and healthy subjects (pain-free negative control group). We collected
      blood samples to apply immunophenotyping analysis. Written tests were
      administrated for psychological analysis. Data were statistically analyzed. Final
      results showed that the percentage of Mu-positive B cells were statistically
      lower in FM and OA patients than in pain-free subjects. A low expression of
      Mu-positive B cell was not associated with the psychological characteristics
      investigated. In conclusion, here we propose the percentage of Mu-positive B
      cells as a biological marker for an objective diagnosis of chronic pain suffering
      patients, also contributing to the legitimacy of FM as a truly painful disease.

TI  - Breast Cancer Care in Jordan.
LID - JGO.19.00279
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in Jordan and the third leading cause
      of cancer death after lung and colorectal cancers. Although the incidence of
      breast cancer in Jordan is lower than that in industrialized nations, the number 
      of new cases has been significantly increasing, and women present with breast
      cancer at a younger age and with more advanced disease than women in Western
      countries. Jordan is a medium-income country with limited resources and a young
      population structure. Therefore, breast cancer poses a particularly challenging
      burden on the country’s health care system. Despite ongoing endeavors to improve 
      breast cancer care at both public and private levels, more work is needed to
      achieve downstaging of the disease and improve access, awareness, and
      participation in early detection. Multimodality treatment facilities and
      supportive care are available; however, the quality of care varies widely
      according to where the patient is treated, and most treatment facilities remain
      located centrally, thus, creating access difficulties. The King Hussein Cancer
      Center, the only comprehensive cancer center in Jordan, has changed the practice 
      of oncology in the country via implementation of a multidisciplinary approach to 
      treatment, monitoring of treatment outcomes, and investments in ongoing cancer
      research. However, there remains no national system for ensuring provision of
      high-quality cancer care nationwide. Here, we review the epidemiology of breast
      cancer and the current status of breast cancer care in Jordan, we compare our
      treatment outcomes with international ones, and we highlight challenges and

TI  - Gastrointestinal perforation: clinical and MDCT clues for identification of
      aetiology.
LID - 31
AB  - Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) perforation is a common medical emergency associated
      with considerable mortality, ranging from 30 to 50%. Clinical presentation
      varies: oesophageal perforations can present with acute chest pain, odynophagia
      and vomiting, gastroduodenal perforations with acute severe abdominal pain, while
      colonic perforations tend to follow a slower progression course with secondary
      bacterial peritonitis or localised abscesses. A subset of patients may present
      with delayed symptoms, abscess mimicking an abdominal mass, or with sepsis.Direct
      multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) findings support the diagnosis and
      localise the perforation site while ancillary findings may suggest underlying
      conditions that need further investigation following primary repair of ruptured
      bowel. MDCT findings include extraluminal gas, visible bowel wall discontinuity, 
      extraluminal contrast, bowel wall thickening, abnormal mural enhancement,
      localised fat stranding and/or free fluid, as well as localised phlegmon or
      abscess in contained perforations.The purpose of this article is to review the
      spectrum of MDCT findings encountered in GIT perforation and emphasise the MDCT
      and clinical clues suggestive of the underlying aetiology and localisation of
      perforation site.

TI  - The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σVreI is active during infection and
      contributes to phosphate starvation-induced virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
LID - 3139
AB  - The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σVreI of the human pathogen
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes transcription of potential virulence
      determinants, including secretion systems and secreted proteins. Its activity is 
      modulated by the VreR anti-σ factor that inhibits the binding of σVreI to the RNA
      polymerase in the absence of a (still unknown) inducing signal. The vreI-vreR
      genes are expressed under inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation, a physiological
      condition often encountered in the host that increases P. aeruginosa
      pathogenicity. However, whether or not σVreI is active in vivo during infection
      and contributes to the Pi starvation-induced virulence of this pathogen has not
      been analyzed yet. Using zebrafish embryos and a human alveolar basal epithelial 
      cell line as P. aeruginosa hosts, we demonstrate in this work that σVreI is
      active during infection and that lack of σVreI considerably reduces the Pi
      starvation-induced virulence of this pathogen. Surprisingly, lack of the σVreI
      inhibitor, the VreR anti-σ factor, also diminishes the virulence of P.
      aeruginosa. By transcriptomic analyses we show that VreR modulates gene
      expression not only in a σVreI-dependent but also in a σVreI-independent manner. 
      This includes potential virulence determinants and transcriptional regulators
      that could be responsible for the reduced virulence of the ΔvreR mutant.

TI  - Deficits in pain medication in older adults with chronic pain receiving home
      care: A cross-sectional study in Germany.
LID - e0229229
AB  - Objective: To analyze the pattern and appropriateness of pain medications in
      older adults receiving home care. Methods: We performed a prospective
      cross-sectional study in patients ≥65 years old having chronic pain and receiving
      home care in Berlin, Germany. Data on prescribed pain medications were collected 
      using self-reported information, nursing documents, and medication plans during
      interviews at home. Pain intensity was determined with the numeric rating scale
      (NRS) and the Pain Assessment In Advanced dementia (PAINAD) scale. The Pain
      Medication Appropriateness Scale score (SPMAS) was applied to evaluate
      inappropriateness (i.e. a score ≤67) of pain medication. Results: Overall 322
      patients with a mean age of 82.1 ± 7.4 years (71.4% females) were evaluated. The 
      average pain intensity scores during the last 24 hours were 5.3 ± 2.1 and 2.3 ±
      2.3 on NRS and PAINAD scale (range 0–10, respectively). Sixty (18.6%) patients
      did not receive any pain medication. Among the treated patients, dipyrone was the
      most frequently prescribed analgesic (71.4%), while 50.8% and 19.1% received
      systemic treatment with opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      respectively. The observed median SPMAS was 47.6 (range 0–100) with 58 (18.0%) of
      patients achieving appropriate values. Half of the patients were treated with
      scheduled, while 29.9% were only treated with on-demand medications. Cognitive
      status had no effect on appropriateness of pain treatment. Conclusions: We
      observed substantial deficits in dosing patterns and appropriateness of pain
      medication in older adults with pain receiving home care. This applied to both
      patients with and without severe cognitive impairment.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of acupuncture on relieving abdominal pain and distension for
      acute pancreatitis: A protocol for systematic review.
LID - e19044
AB  - Introduction:: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of acupuncture on relieving abdominal pain and distension in acute pancreatitis. 
      Methods and analysis:: We will electronically search PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web
      of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, China National
      Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical Literature Database, China Science
      Journal Database, and Wanfang Database from their inception. Furthermore, we will
      manually retrieve other resources, including reference lists of identified
      publications, conference articles, and gray literature. The clinical randomized
      controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials related to acupuncture
      treating acute pancreatitis will be included in the study. The language is
      limited to Chinese and English. Research selection, data extraction, and research
      quality assessment will be independently completed by 2 researchers. Data will be
      synthesized using a fixed effects model or random effects model depending on the 
      heterogeneity test. The overall response rate and the visual analog scale score
      will be the primary outcomes. The time of first bowel sound, the time of first
      defecation, the length of hospitalization, acute physiology and chronic health
      evaluation II score, and the adverse events will also be assessed as secondary
      outcomes. RevMan 5 (version 5.3) statistical software will be used for
      meta-analysis, and the level of evidence will be assessed by Grading of
      Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Continuous data will be 
      expressed in the form of weighted mean difference or standardized mean difference
      with 95% confidence intervals, whereas dichotomous data will be expressed in the 
      form of risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Ethics and dissemination:: The
      protocol of this systematic review does not require ethical approval because it
      does not involve humans. We will publish this article in peer-reviewed journals
      and present at relevant conferences. PROSPERO registration number::
      CRD42019147503.

TI  - Predictors of 1-year mortality in patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation
      after surgery in intensive care unit: a multicenter, retrospective cohort study.
LID - 44
AB  - Objectives: The requirement of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) is
      associated with increased medical care demand and expenses, high early and
      long-term mortality, and worse life quality. However, no study has assessed the
      prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality among PMV patients, not less 
      than 21 days after surgery. This study analyzed the predictors of 1-year
      mortality in patients requiring PMV in intensive care units (ICUs) after surgery.
      Methods: In this multicenter, respective cohort study, 124 patients who required 
      PMV after surgery in the ICUs of five tertiary hospitals in Beijing between
      January 2007 and June 2016 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the duration of
      survival within 1 year. Predictors of 1-year mortality were identified with a
      multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. The predictive effect of the ProVent
      score was also validated. Results: Of the 124 patients enrolled, the cumulative
      1-year mortality was 74.2% (92/124). From the multivariable Cox proportional
      hazard analysis, cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.14, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 1.37–3.35; P < 0.01), no tracheostomy (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22–3.30;
      P < 0.01), enteral nutrition intolerance (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.19–2.97; P = 0.01),
      blood platelet count ≤150 × 109/L (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14–2.75; P = 0.01),
      requirement of vasopressors (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13–2.80; P = 0.02), and renal
      replacement therapy (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01–2.91; P = 0.047) on the 21st day of
      mechanical ventilation (MV) were associated with shortened 1-year survival.
      Conclusions: For patients who required PMV after surgery, cancer diagnosis, no
      tracheostomy, enteral nutrition intolerance, blood platelet count ≤150 × 109/L,
      vasopressor requirement, and renal replacement therapy on the 21st day of MV were
      associated with shortened 1-year survival. The prognosis in PMV patients in ICUs 
      can facilitate the decision-making process of physicians and patients’ family
      members on treatment schedule.

TI  - Aspirin and fracture risk: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis of
      observational studies.
LID - e026876
AB  - Objectives: This review provides insights into the potential for aspirin to
      preserve bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce fracture risk, building knowledge 
      of the risk-benefit profile of aspirin. Methods: We conducted a systematic review
      and exploratory meta-analysis of observational studies. Electronic searches of
      MEDLINE and Embase, and a manual search of bibliographies was undertaken for
      studies published to 28 March 2018. Studies were included if: participants were
      men or women aged ≥18 years; the exposure of interest was aspirin; and relative
      risks, ORs and 95% CIs for the risk of fracture or difference (percentage or
      absolute) in BMD (measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) between aspirin
      users and non-users were presented. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna
      Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists for observational studies. Pooled 
      ORs for any fracture and standardised mean differences (SMDs) for BMD outcomes
      were calculated using random-effects models. Results: Twelve studies met the
      inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Aspirin use was
      associated with a 17% lower odds for any fracture (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99; 
      I2=71%; six studies; n=511 390). Aspirin was associated with a higher total hip
      BMD for women (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.07; I2=0%; three studies; n=9686) and 
      men (SMD 0.06, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.13, I2=0%; two studies; n=4137) although these
      associations were not significant. Similar results were observed for lumbar spine
      BMD in women (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.09; I2=34%; four studies; n=11 330) and
      men (SMD 0.08; 95% CI −0.01 to 0.18; one study; n=432). Conclusions: While the
      benefits of reduced fracture risk and higher BMD from aspirin use may be modest
      for individuals, if confirmed in prospective controlled trials, they may confer a
      large population benefit given the common use of aspirin in older people.

TI  - Efficient Prediction of Vitamin B Deficiencies via Machine-Learning Using Routine
      Blood Test Results in Patients With Intense Psychiatric Episode.
LID - 1029
AB  - Background: Vitamin B deficiency is common worldwide and may lead to psychiatric 
      symptoms; however, vitamin B deficiency epidemiology in patients with intense
      psychiatric episode has rarely been examined. Moreover, vitamin deficiency
      testing is costly and time-consuming, which has hampered effectively ruling out
      vitamin deficiency-induced intense psychiatric symptoms. In this study, we aimed 
      to clarify the epidemiology of these deficiencies and efficiently predict them
      using machine-learning models from patient characteristics and routine blood test
      results that can be obtained within one hour. Methods: We reviewed 497
      consecutive patients, who are deemed to be at imminent risk of seriously harming 
      themselves or others, over a period of 2 years in a single psychiatric
      tertiary-care center. Machine-learning models (k-nearest neighbors, logistic
      regression, support vector machine, and random forest) were trained to predict
      each deficiency from age, sex, and 29 routine blood test results gathered in the 
      period from September 2015 to December 2016. The models were validated using a
      dataset collected from January 2017 through August 2017. Results: We found that
      112 (22.5%), 80 (16.1%), and 72 (14.5%) patients had vitamin B1, vitamin B12, and
      folate (vitamin B9) deficiency, respectively. Further, the machine-learning
      models were well generalized to predict deficiency in the future unseen data,
      especially using random forest; areas under the receiver operating characteristic
      curves for the validation dataset (i.e., the dataset not used for training the
      models) were 0.716, 0.599, and 0.796, respectively. The Gini importance of these 
      vitamins provided further evidence of a relationship between these vitamins and
      the complete blood count, while also indicating a hitherto rarely considered,
      potential association between these vitamins and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or
      thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Discussion: This study demonstrates that
      machine-learning can efficiently predict some vitamin deficiencies in patients
      with active psychiatric symptoms, based on the largest cohort to date with
      intense psychiatric episode. The prediction method may expedite risk
      stratification and clinical decision-making regarding whether replacement therapy
      should be prescribed. Further research includes validating its external
      generalizability in other clinical situations and clarify whether interventions
      based on this method could improve patient care and cost-effectiveness.

TI  - Bone metastases in thyroid cancer.
LID - 100282
AB  - •Osseous metastases (OMs) occur in only 4% of all thyroid cancer patients but are
      associated with greatly increased morbidity and mortality.•OMs are about twice as
      frequent in follicular, hurthle cell, and medullary thyroid cancers as compared
      to papillary thyroid cancers.•OMs are often lytic, triggered via activation of
      osteoclasts by tumor cells in a “vicious cycle”.•OMs are often initially
      asymptomatic, but associated with eventual skeletal related events in >75%.•Early
      identification of OMs, preemptive treatment with antiresorptive agents, and
      aggressive treatment of focal lesions before crisis are key.

TI  - Non-Adherence to Pharmacotherapy: A Prospective Multicentre Study About Its
      Incidence and Its Causes Perceived by Chronic Pain Patients.
PG  - 321-32
AB  - Objective: Pharmacological interventions remain the cornerstone of chronic pain
      treatment; however, nearly 40% of the prescription medicines are not taken as
      prescribed. The present study aims at understanding and describing non-adherence 
      from the perspective of chronic pain patients during a 1-year follow-up study.
      Methods: A cohort of 950 consecutive patients referred to a first consultation in
      Multidisciplinary Chronic Pain Clinics was followed with a standardized protocol 
      for 1 year. This included assessment of pain characteristics; prescribed
      medication; therapeutic adherence; effectiveness of treatment, non-adherence and 
      its perceived reasons; clinical outcomes and quality of life. We used a mixed
      methods approach, including qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results:
      Forty-nine percent of the 562 patients who responded to all assessments during
      follow-up were adherent after 1 year of chronic pain treatment. The core
      associations between each “non-adherence reason” and Anatomical Therapeutic
      Chemical Code (ATC) group were perceived side effects (p=0.019) and delayed start
      (p=0.022) for narcotic ﻿analgesics (opioids); perceived non-efficacy (p=0.017)
      and delayed start (p=0.004) for antiepileptics and anticonvulsants; perceived low
      necessity (p=0.041) and delayed start (p=0.036) for analgesics antipyretics;
      change in prescriptions because of a new clinical condition for antidepressants
      (p=0.024); high concerns (p=0.045) and change in prescriptions because of a new
      clinical condition (p<0.001) for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; delayed
      start (p=0.016) and financial constraints (p=0.018) for other medications.
      Discussion: This study emphasizes the patient’s perspective regarding
      non-adherence to pharmacological treatment of chronic pain, providing valuable
      and novel information to be used in future interventions to help patients make an
      informed choice about their adherence behavior.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Patients' Subjective Feelings Toward Total Hip
      Arthroplasty with Patient‐Specific Instruments and Traditional Total Hip
      Arthroplasty.
PG  - 269-76
AB  - Objective: To determine whether differences exist in patients' subjective
      feelings, daily life, and surgical satisfaction between those who underwent
      surgery for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) using patient‐specific
      instruments (PSIs) and those who underwent traditional surgical total hip
      arthroplasty (THA). Methods: We selected 30 adult patients with various types of 
      DDH who underwent surgery during 2016–2017 at our hospital. The patients were
      divided into PSI surgery group and the traditional surgery group. All patients
      underwent follow‐up, and we collected data on the Harris Hip Score, Oxford
      University Hip Score (OHS), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS‐12), Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, intraoperative surgical time, amount of 
      bleeding and postoperative complications incidence for both groups. We then
      performed statistical analyses on the data. Results: The Harris Hip Score, OHS,
      VAS score, patient satisfaction score, and mean bleeding volume did not differ
      statistically significantly (t‐tests, P > 0.05). No statistically significant
      differences were found between surgical groups in the incidence of complication
      and sub‐trochanteric osteotomy, or in the surgical side (chi‐square tests,
      P > 0.05). For the experimental group, the FJS‐12 score was 80.0 ± 12.0, and for 
      the control group the score was 68.5 ± 16.1. The operative time of the
      experimental group was 138.4 ± 32.2 min, while that of the control group was
      88.9 ± 26.8 min. The values of these data differed significantly (t‐tests,
      P < 0.05). Conclusions: The novel PSI designed by our group has certain
      advantages for the short‐term subjective feelings of patients after THA, but it
      may cause prolonged operative times.

TI  - Pramipexole in peritoneal dialysis patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS): a 
      protocol for a multicentre double-blind randomised controlled trial.
LID - e033815
AB  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sensorimotor 
      disorder among patients with end stage renal disease. This clinical trial aimed
      to provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of pramipexole in patients with
      uremic RLS receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods and analysis: This is a
      12-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial. In total, 104 patients with uremic RLS receiving PD will be enrolled from 
      four hospitals and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either placebo or
      pramipexole. We will determine the efficacy of pramipexole in the improvement of 
      International RLS Study Group Rating Scale as the primary outcome, while
      responder rates for other RLS scales at week 12, change from baseline to week 12 
      for psychological status, sleep disorder and quality of life and blood pressure
      represent the secondary outcomes. Ethics and dissemination: The study was
      approved by the ethics committees of Peking University First Hospital, Xinqiao
      hospital of Army Medical University, Cangzhou Center Hospital and Peking
      University Shenzhen Hospital. The results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed
      journals. Trial registration number: NCT03817554

TI  - Evaluation of clarity of the STOPP/START criteria for clinical applicability in
      prescribing for older people: a quality appraisal study.
LID - e033721
AB  - Objectives: Appropriate prescribing in older people continues to be challenging. 
      Studies still report a high prevalence of inappropriate prescribing in older
      people. To reduce the problem of underprescribing and overprescribing in this
      population, explicit drug optimisation tools like Screening Tool of Older
      Persons’ potentially inappropriate Prescriptions/Screening Tool to Alert to Right
      Treatment (STOPP/START) have been developed. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the clinical applicability of STOPP/START criteria in daily patient care
      by assessing the clarity of singular criteria. Design: Quality appraisal study.
      Methods: For each of the 114 STOPP/START criteria V.2, elements describing the
      action (what/how to do), condition (when to do) and explanation (why to do) were 
      identified. Next, the clarity of these three elements was quantified on a 7-point
      Likert scale using tools provided by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and
      Evaluation (AGREE) Consortium. Primary and secondary outcomes: The primary
      outcome measure was the clarity rating per element, categorised into high
      (>67.7%), moderate (33.3%–67.7%) or low (<33.3%). Secondary, factors that
      positively or negatively affected clarity most were identified. Additionally, the
      nature of the conditions was further classified into five descriptive components:
      disease, sign, symptom, laboratory finding and medication. Results: STOPP
      recommendations had an average clarity rating of 64%, 60% and 69% for actions,
      conditions and explanations, respectively. The average clarity rating in START
      recommendations was 60% and 57% for actions and conditions, respectively. There
      were no statements present to substantiate the prescription of potential
      omissions for the 34 START criteria. Conclusions: Our results show that the
      clarity of the STOPP/START criteria can be improved. For future development of
      explicit drug optimisation tools, such as STOPP/START, our findings identified
      facilitators (high clarity) and barriers (low clarity) that can be used to
      improve the clarity of clinical practice guidelines on a language level and
      therefore enhance clinical applicability.

TI  - The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Treatment Gap: A National Study of Substance Use 
      Disorder Treatment.
LID - 1178221820904150
AB  - Background:: Anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) use is associated with serious
      mental and physical health problems. Evidence indicates that AAS use among people
      who use psychoactive substances is higher than in the general population. This
      study aims to estimate lifetime AAS use among patients in substance use disorder 
      (SUD) treatment, compare characteristics of AAS and non-AAS users and identify
      whether AAS use was addressed during treatment. Methods:: This cross-sectional
      survey included 563 (142 women, 24.2%) patients in 38 SUD treatment facilities in
      Norway. Respondents reported on AAS and substance use, and treatment experiences.
      Results:: Lifetime AAS use was reported by 156 (28.3%) SUD patients, thereof
      35.6% of the men and 8.0% of the women. Lifetime AAS use was highest among men
      with stimulants (55.8%) as preferred substance, and lowest among men who
      preferred alcohol (14.6%). Initiation of AAS use due to getting thinner following
      substance use was reported by 44.5% of the AAS using men. AAS users reported more
      severe substance use than non-AAS users. More than half (58%) of all patients had
      not been asked about AAS use, and 42.4% of those who were asked, experienced that
      treatment providers lacked expertise about AAS. Conclusion:: Lifetime AAS use in 
      this sample of SUD patients is common practice and comprise an underrecognized
      problem in SUD treatment. Given the deleterious implications to the individual
      and society that concomitant use of AAS may cause, it would be essential to raise
      the awareness about AAS use among SUD patients, and the level of competence among
      health professionals.

TI  - Timing is everything: Early do-not-resuscitate orders in the intensive care unit 
      and patient outcomes.
LID - e0227971
AB  - Background: The use of Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders has increased but many are
      placed late in the dying process. This study is to determine the association
      between the timing of DNR order placement in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
      nurses’ perceptions of patients’ distress and quality of death. Methods: 200 ICU 
      patients and the nurses (n = 83) who took care of them during their last week of 
      life were enrolled from the medical ICU and cardiac care unit of New York
      Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan and the surgical ICU at
      the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Nurses were interviewed about their
      perceptions of the patients’ quality of death using validated measures. Patients 
      were divided into 3 groups—no DNR, early DNR, late DNR placement during the
      patient’s final ICU stay. Logistic regression analyses modeled perceived patient 
      quality of life as a function of timing of DNR order placement. Patient’s
      comorbidities, length of ICU stay, and procedures were also included in the
      model. Results: 59 patients (29.5%) had a DNR placed within 48 hours of ICU
      admission (early DNR), 110 (55%) placed after 48 hours of ICU admission (late
      DNR), and 31 (15.5%) had no DNR order placed. Compared to patients without DNR
      orders, those with an early but not late DNR order placement had significantly
      fewer non-beneficial procedures and lower odds of being rated by nurses as not
      being at peace (Adjusted Odds Ratio namely AOR = 0.30; [CI = 0.09–0.94]), and
      experiencing worst possible death (AOR = 0.31; [CI = 0.1–0.94]) before
      controlling for procedures; and consistent significance in severe suffering (AOR 
      = 0.34; [CI = 0.12–0.96]), and experiencing a severe loss of dignity (AOR = 0.33;
      [CI = 0.12–0.94]), controlling for non-beneficial procedures. Conclusions:
      Placement of DNR orders within the first 48 hours of the terminal ICU admission
      was associated with fewer non-beneficial procedures and less perceived suffering 
      and loss of dignity, lower odds of being not at peace and of having the worst
      possible death.

TI  - National U.S. time-trends in opioid use disorder hospitalizations and associated 
      healthcare utilization and mortality.
LID - e0229174
AB  - Background: The opioid epidemic is a major public health crisis in the U.S.
      Contemporary data on opioid use disorder (OUD) related hospitalizations are
      needed. Our objective was to assess whether OUD hospitalizations and associated
      mortality are increasing over time and examine the factors associated healthcare 
      utilization and mortality. Methods and findings: We examined the rates of OUD
      hospitalizations and associated mortality using the U.S. National Inpatient
      Sample (NIS) data from 1998–2016. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression
      assessed the association of demographic, clinical and hospital characteristics
      with inpatient mortality and healthcare utilization (total hospital charges,
      discharge to a rehabilitation facility, length of hospital stay) during the index
      hospitalization for opioid use disorder. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and
      95% confidence intervals (CI). We estimated 781,767 OUD hospitalizations. The
      rate of OUD hospitalization and associated mortality (/100,000 overall NIS
      hospitalizations) increased from 59.8 and 1.2 in 1998–2000 to 190.7 and 5.9 in
      2015–16, respectively. In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, the following
      factors were associated with worse outcomes; compared to age <34 years, older age
      was associated with higher risk of hospital charges above the median and length
      of stay >3 days, slightly higher risk of discharge to a rehabilitation facility. 
      Higher Deyo-Charlson score was associated with higher hospital charges, length of
      hospital stay, and inpatient mortality. Women had lower odds of inpatient
      mortality than men and blacks had lower odds of mortality than whites.
      Conclusions: Rising OUD hospitalizations from 1998 to 2016 and increasing
      associated inpatient mortality are concerning. Certain groups are at higher risk 
      of poor utilization outcomes and inpatient mortality. Resources and healthcare
      policies need to focus on the high-risk group to reduce mortality and associated 
      utilization.

TI  - Compliance of private pharmacies in Uganda with controlled prescription drugs
      regulations: a mixed-methods study.
LID - 16
AB  - Background: Controlled prescription drug use disorders are a growing global
      health challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. Effective supply chain regulations on
      dispensing and stock control are important for controlling this epidemic. Since
      compliance with these regulations in resource-limited countries is poor, there is
      need to understand its predictors in order to reduce the risk of prescription
      drug use disorders. Methods: A mixed-methods study utilizing a structured
      questionnaire and a simulated client guide was undertaken in Kampala and Mbale
      towns in Uganda. The questionnaire recorded self-reported dispensing and verified
      stock control practices and their covariates from 101 private pharmacies. The
      guide recorded actual dispensing practices from 27 pharmacies. Snowball sampling 
      was done to enrich the sample with pharmacies that stock opioids. The mean
      compliance with good dispensing and stock control practices was calculated.
      Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of 
      compliance. Results: The mean compliance with dispensing and stock control
      requirements was 82.9% and 23%, respectively. Twenty percent and 40% of the
      pharmacies dispensed pethidine without a prescription and with invalid
      prescriptions, respectively. Having a pharmacist on duty (OR = 5.17; p = 0.02),
      prior in-service training on narcotics regulations (OR = 3.51; p = 0.04), and
      previous narcotics audits by the regulator (OR = 5.11; p = 0.01) were independent
      predictors of compliance with stock control requirements. Pharmacies with a
      previous history of poor compliance with dispensing requirements were less likely
      to demonstrate good compliance (OR = 0.21; p = 0.01). Conclusions: There is
      suboptimal compliance to controlled prescription drug regulations among Uganda’s 
      pharmacies. A previous history of poor compliance to dispensing requirements
      predicted low compliance in subsequent assessments. Training and regulatory
      audits increased compliance in stock control but not dispensing. Expansion of
      training and audits to more pharmacies and/or incentives for compliance are
      necessary.

TI  - Metabolomics in Psychiatric Disorders: What We Learn from Animal Models.
LID - 72
AB  - Biomarkers are a recent research target within biological factors of psychiatric 
      disorders. There is growing evidence for deriving biomarkers within psychiatric
      disorders in serum or urine samples in humans, however, few studies have
      investigated this differentiation in brain or cerebral fluid samples in
      psychiatric disorders. As brain samples from humans are only available at
      autopsy, animal models are commonly applied to determine the pathogenesis of
      psychiatric diseases and to test treatment strategies. The aim of this review is 
      to summarize studies on biomarkers in animal models for psychiatric disorders.
      For depression, anxiety and addiction disorders studies, biomarkers in animal
      brains are available. Furthermore, several studies have investigated psychiatric 
      medication, e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants, or mood stabilizers, in
      animals. The most notable changes in biomarkers in depressed animal models were
      related to the glutamate-γ-aminobutyric acid-glutamine-cycle. In anxiety models, 
      alterations in amino acid and energy metabolism (i.e., mitochondrial regulation) 
      were observed. Addicted animals showed several biomarkers according to the
      induced drugs. In summary, animal models provide some direct insights into the
      cellular metabolites that are produced during psychiatric processes. In addition,
      the influence on biomarkers due to short- or long-term medication is a noticeable
      finding. Further studies should combine representative animal models and human
      studies on cerebral fluid to improve insight into mental disorders and advance
      the development of novel treatment strategies.

TI  - Open-label placebo treatment of women with premenstrual syndrome: study protocol 
      of a randomised controlled trial.
LID - e032868
AB  - Introduction: Recent evidence suggests that for certain clinical conditions,
      placebos can improve clinical outcomes even without deception. These so-called
      open-label placebos (OLPs) bear the advantage of a significant lower risk of
      adverse events and comply with ethical principles. Although premenstrual syndrome
      (PMS) seems to be considerably susceptible to placebo effects, no study has
      examined open-OLP responses on PMS. Methods and analysis: To test the efficacy of
      OLPs in women suffering from PMS, a clinical randomised controlled trial
      including two OLP study groups (with and without treatment rationale) was
      designed to investigate on the effect on PMS. PMS symptoms are monitored on a
      daily basis via a symptom diary, adverse events are monitored intermittently. The
      study started in spring 2018 and patients will be included until a maximum of 150
      participants are randomised. Besides the primary outcome PMS symptom intensity
      and interference, an array of further variables is assessed. Multilevel modelling
      will be used for data analyses. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was
      obtained from the Ethics Committee Northwest and Central Switzerland. Results of 
      the main analysis and of secondary analyses will be submitted for publication in 
      peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration numbers: (1) ClinicalTrials.gov
      (NCT03547661); (2) Swiss national registration (SNCTP000002809).

TI  - Is marijuana use associated with decreased use of prescription opioids?
      Toxicological findings from two US national samples of drivers.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: State governments in the United States are increasingly viewing
      marijuana legalization as a policy option for controlling the opioid epidemic
      under the premise that marijuana is a less harmful substitute for opioids. The
      purpose of this study is to assess whether marijuana use is associated with
      decreased odds of prescription opioid use. Methods: A cross-sectional study
      design was applied to toxicological testing data from two national samples of
      drivers: 1) the 2011–2016 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and 2) the
      2013–2014 National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers (NRS).
      Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated from
      multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of 
      marijuana use with prescription opioid use and alcohol use. Results: Among the
      47,602 drivers from the FARS, 15.7% tested positive for marijuana and 6.9%
      positive for prescription opioids. Compared with drivers testing negative for
      marijuana, those testing positive for marijuana were 28% more likely to test
      positive for prescription opioids (adjusted OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.15–1.42). Among
      the 7881 drivers from the NRS, 7.9% tested positive for marijuana and 4.5%
      positive for prescription opioids. Relative to drivers testing negative for
      marijuana, those testing positive for marijuana were twice as likely to test
      positive for prescription opioids (adjusted OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.29–3.20). In
      both study samples, marijuana use was associated with significantly increased
      odds of alcohol positivity. Conclusions: Drivers who test positive for marijuana 
      are significantly more likely to test positive for prescription opioids.
      Longitudinal studies with rigorous designs and toxicological testing data are
      needed to further address the substitution hypothesis between marijuana and
      prescription opioids.

TI  - Ethnopharmacological Applications Targeting Alcohol Abuse: Overview and Outlook.
LID - 1593
AB  - Excessive alcohol consumption is the cause of several diseases and thus is of a
      major concern for society. Worldwide alcohol consumption has increased by many
      folds over the past decades. This urgently calls for intervention and relapse
      counteract measures. Modern pharmacological solutions induce complete alcohol
      self-restraint and prevent relapse, but they have many side effects. Natural
      products are most promising as they cause fewer adverse effects. Here we discuss 
      in detail the medicinal plants used in various traditional/folklore medicine
      systems for targeting alcohol abuse. We also comprehensively describe preclinical
      and clinical studies done on some of these plants along with the possible
      mechanisms of action.

TI  - Survey of Addiction Specialists’ Use of Medications to Treat Alcohol Use
      Disorder.
LID - 47
AB  - Objectives: Several medications have been shown to be safe and effective for
      treating alcohol use disorder (AUD); however, these medications are prescribed
      infrequently. We conducted a survey of the demographics, practice
      characteristics, and self-perceived knowledge, experience, and opinions of
      addiction specialists on the use of AUD medications and how to increase their
      use. Methods: We sent a 19-question survey to members of the American Society of 
      Addiction Medicine (ASAM) and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry
      (AAAP). Results: We received a total of 395 responses from ASAM members and 194
      responses from AAAP members. One hundred of the respondents were members of both 
      organizations. The large majority of respondents (92.6%) were prescribers, and
      81.6% were non-trainee physicians. The two most frequently used medications for
      treating AUD were oral naltrexone (27%) and long-acting naltrexone (18%).
      Respondents were significantly more confident in the strength of the research
      findings and evidence for the efficacy and safety of naltrexone than other AUD
      medications (p < 0.001 ). Respondents identified additional education to current 
      providers about existing medications as the most important potential intervention
      to increase the use of AUD medications. Conclusions: Compared with a survey
      published in 2001, in 2018 the proportion of respondents who reported using
      naltrexone more than doubled and addiction specialists were more confident in
      their use of AUD medications, rating their efficacy and safety more highly.
      Consistent with findings from other recent studies, providing more education to
      practitioners about existing AUD medications may be the most effective way to
      increase their use.

TI  - Are Anticholinergic Medications Associated With Increased Risk of Dementia and
      Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia? A Nationwide 15-Year Follow-Up
      Cohort Study in Taiwan.
LID - 30
AB  - Background/Objective: In previous reports, the usage of anticholinergic
      medications has been associated with an increased risk of dementia with prolonged
      usage or with a high Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB). This study aimed to 
      investigate the association between anticholinergic medications and the risk of
      dementia using data from Taiwan's National Health Research Database (NHIRD).
      Methods: A total of 790,240 patients, with 197,560 patients receiving
      anticholinergic medications and 592,680 control patients (1:3) matched for sex,
      age, and index-year, were enrolled from the two million Longitudinal Health
      Insurance Dataset, a subdataset of the NHIRD, between 2000 and 2015. The
      time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to explore the hazard ratio (HR) 
      with a 95% confidence interval for the association between anticholinergics and
      the risk of dementia during the 15-year follow-up. The behavioral and
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) were recognized by the usage of
      psychotropics. The ACB ranged from zero to three, divided as score <1, 1–1.9,
      2–2.9, 3–4.9,and ≧5. The sensitivity analysis was done by excluding the diagnoses
      of dementia in the first 2 or 4 years after anticholinergic usage. Results: In
      the anticholinergic usage cohort, the HR was 1.043 (95% CI = 0.958-1.212, p =
      0.139) without a significant difference. The sensitivity analysis revealed no
      association between the usage of anticholinergics and the risk of dementia.
      Anticholinergic usage was not associated with BPSD. Male sex, patients of ages of
      60–64 and ≧80, usage of antiparkinsonian medications, a history of Parkinson's
      disease, epilepsy, urinary incontinence, depression, bipolar disorder, and
      psychotic disorder were independent risk factors of dementia. Increased HRs for
      dementia were associated with an ACB ≥ 5 and an anticholinergic usage period ≥
      1,460 days. Conclusion: In this study, the usage of anticholinergics was not
      associated with the risk of dementia or BPSD in a 15-year follow-up study.
      However, patients with the male sex, patients with ages of 65–79 and ≧80,
      patients with some comorbidities, high ACB scores, and long anticholinergic
      treatment duration were associated with the risk of dementia.

TI  - A Review of Scientific Evidence for THC:CBD Oromucosal Spray (Nabiximols) in the 
      Management of Chronic Pain.
PG  - 399-410
AB  - The 20% prevalence of chronic pain in the general population is a major health
      concern given the often profound associated impairment of daily activities,
      employment status, and health-related quality of life in sufferers. Resource
      utilization associated with chronic pain represents an enormous burden for
      healthcare systems. Although analgesia based on the World Health Organization’s
      pain ladder continues to be the mainstay of chronic pain management, aside from
      chronic cancer pain or end-of-life care, prolonged use of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids to manage chronic pain is rarely sustainable. 
      As the endocannabinoid system is known to control pain at peripheral, spinal, and
      supraspinal levels, interest in medical use of cannabis is growing. A proprietary
      blend of cannabis plant extracts containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
      and cannabidiol (CBD) as the principal cannabinoids is formulated as an
      oromucosal spray (USAN name: nabiximols) and standardized to ensure quality,
      consistency and stability. This review examines evidence for THC:CBD oromucosal
      spray (nabiximols) in the management of chronic pain conditions. Cumulative
      evidence from clinical trials and an exploratory analysis of the German Pain
      e-Registry suggests that add-on THC:CBD oromucosal spray (nabiximols) may have a 
      role in managing chronic neuropathic pain, although further precise clinical
      trials are required to draw definitive conclusions.

      Over Time, in Cancer Patients Treated with Opioids: Providing the Clinicians with
      an Evaluation Tool.
LID - 502
AB  - Background: Scanty data exist on the integration between the analgesic effect of 
      opioids, dose changes, and adverse events in cancer patients. Methods: To provide
      further information on this issue, we analysed data on 498 advanced-stage cancer 
      patients treated with strong opioids. At baseline and three visits (at days 7,
      14, and 21), pain intensity, oral morphine-equivalent daily dose, and the
      prevalence of major adverse events were measured. The proportion of responders
      (pain intensity decrease ≥30% from baseline) and non-responders, as well as of
      patients with low or high dose escalation, was calculated. Results: Pain
      intensity strongly decreased from baseline (pain intensity difference −4.0 at day
      7 and −4.2 at day 21) in responders, while it was quite stable in non-responders 
      (pain intensity difference −0.8 at day 7 and −0.9 at day 21). In low dose
      escalation patients (82.4% at final visit), daily dose changed from 52.3 to 65.3 
      mg; in high dose escalation patients (17.6%), it varied from 94.1 to 146.7 mg.
      Among responders, high dose escalation patients experienced significantly more
      frequent adverse events compared to low or high dose escalation patients, while
      no differences were observed in non-responders. Conclusions: The response to
      opioids results from the combination of three clinical aspects, which are
      strongly interrelated. These results provide some thoughts to help clinical
      evaluations and therapeutic decisions regarding opioid use.

TI  - Effects of Topical Hangeshashinto (TJ-14) on Chemotherapy-Induced Oral Mucositis.
PG  - 1069-78
AB  - Purpose: Hangeshashinto (TJ-14), a Kampo medicine comprising seven types of
      herbs, has been used in Japan to alleviate the side effects associated with
      anticancer drug treatments. However, the pharmacological effects of this medicine
      currently remain unclear. The present study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of 
      TJ-14 against anticancer drug-induced stomatitis, the pain associated with which 
      may have a negative impact on mastication and swallowing. Methods: Mucositis was 
      induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by cancer chemotherapy. Changes in body weight,
      stomatitis grades, histopathological scores, and oral bacterial counts were
      examined among TJ-14-treated, saline-treated, and Control (no treatment) rats. In
      vitro studies, including cell proliferation and wound healing assays, using
      epidermal keratinocyte and fibroblast cell lines were conducted. Results: The
      local application of TJ-14 exerted strong antibacterial effects and attenuated
      oral chemotherapy-induced stomatitis in rats. TJ-14 also increased the viability 
      and invasion of epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Conclusion: The present 
      results demonstrated the potential of TJ-14 to attenuate chemotherapy-induced
      stomatitis.

TI  - Angiotensin II blockade had no effect on range of motion after total knee
      arthroplasty: a retrospective review.
LID - 48
AB  - Background: Stiffness and pain from arthrofibrosis following total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) is a challenging problem, and investigating methods to prevent
      or reduce the incidence of postoperative arthrofibrosis is critical. Studies have
      shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin
      receptor blockers (ARBs) are efficacious at preventing fibrotic disorders in the 
      lungs, liver, kidneys, and eyes. Our aim was to determine if ACEI or ARB use
      postoperatively reduces the incidence of arthrofibrosis in TKA patients. Methods:
      In a retrospective review, we analyzed 141 consecutive TKAs performed at a single
      institution by a single surgeon from December 2010 to December 2014. Range of
      motion (ROM) in patients already taking ACEI, ARB, or neither medication was
      compared. Independent variables recorded were gender, age, BMI, presence of
      diabetes or preoperative opioid or statin use, preoperative ROM, and use of ACEIs
      or ARBs. Dependent variables recorded were postoperative knee flexion, extension,
      and total arc of motion. The primary outcome variable was success or failure of
      achieving 118o total arc of motion postoperatively, based on a study that found
      significant compromise of function in TKA patients who failed to obtain this
      goal. Secondary endpoints were postoperative knee flexion, extension, and total
      arc of motion. Results: The use of neither ACEIs nor ARBs showed a significant
      difference in attaining greater than 118° of motion postoperatively compared to
      controls at 6 months. Significant predictors of obtaining > 118° motion were BMI 
      (p < 0.05), preoperative flexion (p < 0.001), and preoperative total arc of
      motion (p < 0.002). Significant predictors of secondary ROM outcomes were
      preoperative ROM and BMI. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the principle 
      predictor of postoperative ROM is BMI and preoperative ROM. The use of ACEIs or
      ARBs did not result in a greater likelihood of obtaining satisfactory ROM
      postoperatively.

TI  - Prospects for finding the mechanisms of sex differences in addiction with human
      and model organism genetic analysis.
LID - e12645
AB  - Despite substantial evidence for sex differences in addiction epidemiology,
      addiction‐relevant behaviors and associated neurobiological phenomena, the
      mechanisms and implications of these differences remain unknown. Genetic analysis
      in model organism is a potentially powerful and effective means of discovering
      the mechanisms that underlie sex differences in addiction. Human genetic studies 
      are beginning to show precise risk variants that influence the mechanisms of
      addiction but typically lack sufficient power or neurobiological mechanistic
      access, particularly for the discovery of the mechanisms that underlie sex
      differences. Our thesis in this review is that genetic variation in model
      organisms are a promising approach that can complement these investigations to
      show the biological mechanisms that underlie sex differences in addiction.

TI  - Neighborhood built and social environment and meeting physical activity
      recommendations among mid to older adults with joint pain.
LID - 101063
AB  - Arthritis is a leading cause of disability in the United States, with the most
      efficacious treatments being physical activity (PA). Arthritis patients are less 
      likely to meet PA recommendations and the neighborhood environment may play a
      role. This study examines the effect of neighborhood walkability and social
      cohesion on PA among arthritis patients in a sample of US adults. This
      cross-sectional study used 2015 National Health Interview Survey data. Eligible
      participants were age ≥45 years, had arthritis, recent leg-joint pain and
      complete data. Walkability was based on 6 questions regarding amenities and
      destinations that promote walking. Social cohesion was based on 4 validated
      questions. Meeting PA was defined as 150 min/week. Chi-squared testing and
      logistic regression determined associations between neighborhood environment and 
      PA, including interaction between social cohesion and walkability. The final
      unweighted sample included 3,826 participants with mean age 64.6 years
      (SE = 0.26), 61.8% female and 78.1% non-Hispanic White. In adjusted, weighted
      analysis, not, slightly, and moderately-walkable neighborhoods all had lower odds
      of meeting PA recommendations verses highly-walkable neighborhood (OR = 0.61[95% 
      CI 0.41–0.92], OR = 0.65[95% CI 0.50–0.85], OR = 0.75[95% CI 0.59–0.97],
      respectively). Social cohesion was independently associated with decreased odds
      of meeting PA guidelines (p = 0.003). No interaction with walkability was found
      (p = 0.405). Less than a highly-walkable neighborhood and lower social cohesion
      were independently associated with decreased odds of meeting PA recommendations
      among adults with arthritis and recent joint pain. Since walking is one of the
      most effective treatments for arthritis, clinicians should be sensitive to
      barriers patients may perceive to walking.

TI  - The 100 Top-Cited Studies About Pain and Depression.
LID - 3072
AB  - With the estimated high prevalence in the population, the two symptoms of pain
      and depression threaten the well-being of millions worldwide. Researches of the
      two symptoms increased year by year. Top-cited studies will help to understand
      the achievement and guide researchers toward the direction of the research field.
      However, it is unclear for researches in the field of pain and depression. In
      this paper, we reviewed the bibliometric characteristics of the top-cited papers 
      about pain and depression. We will review the evidence of authorship, country of 
      origin, institution, journal, study type, and publication year for the 100
      top-cited studies on pain and depression based on the Web of Science Core
      collection. We also highlight studies with the highest cited times. Our study
      concluded that pain and depression were correlated, which may share common
      biological pathways.

TI  - Stratified primary care versus non-stratified care for musculoskeletal pain:
      findings from the STarT MSK feasibility and pilot cluster randomized controlled
      trial.
LID - 30
AB  - Background: Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain from the five most common presentations to
      primary care (back, neck, shoulder, knee or multi-site pain), where the majority 
      of patients are managed, is a costly global health challenge. At present,
      first-line decision-making is based on clinical reasoning and stratified models
      of care have only been tested in patients with low back pain. We therefore,
      examined the feasibility of; a) a future definitive cluster randomised controlled
      trial (RCT), and b) General Practitioners (GPs) providing stratified care at the 
      point-of-consultation for these five most common MSK pain presentations. Methods:
      The design was a pragmatic pilot, two parallel-arm (stratified versus
      non-stratified care), cluster RCT and the setting was 8 UK GP practices (4
      intervention, 4 control) with randomisation (stratified by practice size) and
      blinding of trial statistician and outcome data-collectors. Participants were
      adult consulters with MSK pain without indicators of serious pathologies, urgent 
      medical needs, or vulnerabilities. Potential participant records were tagged and 
      individuals sent postal invitations using a GP point-of-consultation electronic
      medical record (EMR) template. The intervention was supported by the EMR template
      housing the Keele STarT MSK Tool (to stratify into low, medium and high-risk
      prognostic subgroups of persistent pain and disability) and recommended matched
      treatment options. Feasibility outcomes included exploration of recruitment and
      follow-up rates, selection bias, and GP intervention fidelity. To capture
      recommended outcomes including pain and function, participants completed an
      initial questionnaire, brief monthly questionnaire (postal or SMS), and 6-month
      follow-up questionnaire. An anonymised EMR audit described GP decision-making.
      Results: GPs screened 3063 patients (intervention = 1591, control = 1472),
      completed the EMR template with 1237 eligible patients (intervention = 513,
      control = 724) and 524 participants (42%) consented to data collection
      (intervention = 231, control = 293). Recruitment took 28 weeks (target 12 weeks) 
      with > 90% follow-up retention (target > 75%). We detected no selection bias of
      concern and no harms identified. GP stratification tool fidelity failed to
      achieve a-priori success criteria, whilst fidelity to the matched treatments
      achieved “complete success”. Conclusions: A future definitive cluster RCT of
      stratified care for MSK pain is feasible and is underway, following key
      amendments including a clinician-completed version of the stratification tool and
      refinements to recommended matched treatments. Trial registration: Name of the
      registry: ISRCTN. Trial registration number: 15366334.Date of registration:

TI  - Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Joint Fusion: The Current Evidence.
PG  - 20-9
AB  - Background: Fusion of the sacroiliac (SI) joint as a treatment for low back pain 
      remains controversial. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the current
      literature and clinical outcomes of SI joint fusion surgery. Methods: We
      conducted a literature review and included studies with the term “sacroiliac
      joint fusion” that had at least 12 months of clinical follow-up, reported on
      minimally invasive techniques, and included patient-reported outcome measures.
      Results: Two approach types (dorsal and lateral) and numerous different implant
      manufacturers were identified. Most studies included level 4 data, with a small
      number of level 2 prospective cohort studies and 2 prospective level 1 studies.
      Every reviewed study reported clinical benefit in terms of improved pain scores
      or improvement in validated disability measures. Complication rates were low.
      Conclusions: Minimally invasive SI joint fusion provides clinically significant
      improvement in pain scores and disability in most patients, across multiple
      studies and implant manufacturers. Level of Evidence: 5 Clinical Relevance:
      Emerging evidence in support of SI joint fusion indicates that clinicians should 
      examine the SI joint and include SI joint pain in their differential diagnosis
      for low back pain patients.

TI  - Conquering the pneumococcal nemesis with oral antibiotics.
PG  - 65-8
AB  - Introduction: Streptococcus pneumoniae endocarditis (SPE) occurs in <3% of all EI
      cases due to the evolution of penicillin and vaccination. However,
      immunocompromised and unvaccinated patients are still at grave risk.Case: A
      58-year-old African American male who used alcohol and intravenous (IV) drugs
      presented with confusion, fever, and hemoptysis. He had coarse rhonchi with a
      grade 2/5 holosystolic apical murmur. CT chest showed diffuse bilateral
      infiltrates. Blood cultures were positive for pansensitive Streptococcus
      pneumoniae. Echocardiogram demonstrated large vegetations on the anterior and
      posterior leaflets of the mitral valve with flail leaflet and severe eccentric
      mitral regurgitation. Patient was started on IV ceftriaxone, but after 3 weeks of
      therapy, he wished to leave against medical advice. He was discharged on
      combination oral therapy with successful resolution of SPE on
      follow-up.Discussion: Invasive pneumococcus is highly virulent causing
      irreversible valvular destruction or death.IV beta-lactams are first-line
      treatment, but there are currently no guideline-recommended alternatives for oral
      therapy. Recent data suggest partial oral therapy may be noninferior to IV only
      therapy.Conclusion: Switching to oral combination antibiotics after at least 2
      weeks of IV therapy is an acceptable alternative to treat SPE.

TI  - Risk factors for pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations in long-term care
      facility residents: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 47
AB  - Background: Older adults who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at
      particularly high risk for infection, morbidity and mortality from pneumonia and 
      influenza (P&I) compared to individuals of younger age and those living outside
      institutional settings. The risk factors for P&I hospitalizations that are
      specific to LTCFs remain poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the
      incidence of P&I hospitalization and associated person- and facility-level
      factors among post-acute (short-stay) and long-term (long-stay) care residents
      residing in LTCFs from 2013 to 2015. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study,
      we used Medicare administrative claims linked to Minimum Data Set and LTCF-level 
      data to identify short-stay (< 100 days, index = admission date) and long-stay
      (100+ days, index = day 100) residents who were followed from the index date
      until the first of hospitalization, LTCF discharge, Medicare disenrollment, or
      death. We measured incidence rates (IRs) for P&I hospitalization per 100,000
      person-days, and estimated associations with baseline demographics, geriatric
      syndromes, clinical characteristics, and medication use using Cox regression
      models. Results: We analyzed data from 1,118,054 short-stay and 593,443 long-stay
      residents. The crude 30-day IRs (95% CI) of hospitalizations with P&I in the
      principal position were 26.0 (25.4, 26.6) and 34.5 (33.6, 35.4) among short- and 
      long-stay residents, respectively. The variables associated with P&I varied
      between short and long-stay residents, and common risk factors included: advanced
      age (85+ years), admission from an acute hospital, select cardiovascular and
      respiratory conditions, impaired functional status, and receipt of antibiotics or
      Beers criteria medications. Facility staffing and care quality measures were
      important risk factors among long-stay residents but not in short-stay residents.
      Conclusions: Short-stay residents had lower crude 30- and 90-day incidence rates 
      of P&I hospitalizations than long-stay LTCF residents. Differences in risk
      factors for P&I between short- and long-stay populations suggest the importance
      of considering distinct profiles of post-acute and long-term care residents in
      infection prevention and control strategies in LTCFs. These findings can help
      clinicians target interventions to subgroups of LTCF residents at highest P&I
      risk.

TI  - Dental caries and periodontal disease among people who use drugs: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
LID - 44
AB  - Background: The aim of our study was to perform a systematic review of the
      literature and meta-analysis in order to investigate relationship between drug
      use and oral health. Methods: We searched for studies in English published before
      July 1, 2019 on PsycINFO, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, and Web of Science. We assessed
      the relationship between drug use (methamphetamines, heroin; opiates; crack,
      cocaine and cannabis as dependent variables) and reported tooth loss, periodontal
      disease, or decayed, missing, and filled teeth index as an independent variable. 
      The data were analyzed using Stata 12.0 software. Results: We initially
      identified 1836 potential articles (with 1100 duplicates) and screened the
      remaining 736 titles and abstracts, comprising 54 studies. In the next step, we
      evaluated the full-texts; 44 studies were excluded, accordingly. In total, we
      included 10 publications in the meta-analysis. Drug type was associated with
      periodontal disease (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.8–2.6) and pooled estimates showed that
      type of drug used increased the odds of the number of decayed, missed and filled 
      teeth (DMFT) (OR 4.11; 95% CI 2.07–8.15) respectively. Conclusions: The
      analytical challenges of segregating the impact of individual drug types on oral 
      health diseases mean that investigations on the direct relationship between oral 
      health status and drug use are limited. Developing programs to improve potential 
      confounding with various substances and addressing the dental health needs of
      people who use drugs is vital if we are to improve their overall quality of life.

TI  - Early Neonatal Pain—A Review of Clinical and Experimental Implications on Painful
      Conditions Later in Life.
LID - 30
AB  - Modern health care has brought our society innumerable benefits but has also
      introduced the experience of pain very early in life. For example, it is now
      routine care for newborns to receive various injections or have blood drawn
      within 24 h of life. For infants who are sick or premature, the pain experiences 
      inherent in the required medical care are frequent and often severe, with
      neonates requiring intensive care admission encountering approximately fourteen
      painful procedures daily in the hospital. Given that much of the world has seen a
      steady increase in preterm births for the last several decades, an ever-growing
      number of babies experience multiple painful events before even leaving the
      hospital. These noxious events occur during a critical period of neurodevelopment
      when the nervous system is very vulnerable due to immaturity and neuroplasticity.
      Here, we provide a narrative review of the literature pertaining to the idea that
      early life pain has significant long-term effects on neurosensory, cognition,
      behavior, pain processing, and health outcomes that persist into childhood and
      even adulthood. We refer to clinical and pre-clinical studies investigating how
      early life pain impacts acute pain later in life, focusing on animal model
      correlates that have been used to better understand this relationship. Current
      knowledge around the proposed underlying mechanisms responsible for the
      long-lasting consequences of neonatal pain, its neurobiological and behavioral
      effects, and its influence on later pain states are discussed. We conclude by
      highlighting that another important consequence of early life pain may be the
      impact it has on later chronic pain states—an area of research that has received 
      little attention.

TI  - Renal insufficiency plays a crucial association factor in severe knee
      osteoarthritis-induced pain in patients with total knee replacement: A
      retrospective study.
LID - e19125
AB  - Pain, the main symptom of osteoarthritis (OA), can lead to functional disability 
      in patients with knee OA. Understanding the association factors related to knee
      pain is important since preventing OA-induced disabilities can be achieved by
      modifying these pain-associated issues. Therefore, this study was aimed to
      investigate the association factors for OA-induced knee pain in Taiwanese
      patients who received total knee replacements (TKR).In this retrospective study, 
      357 subjects who had undergone TKR at the Taipei Municipal Wan-Fang Hospital were
      recruited. The distribution of pain severity among patients with knee OA was
      evaluated. Demographic data and clinical parameters were analyzed to determine
      relationships between these variables and the severity of knee OA pain.Of the 357
      patients studied, 54% and 33% had moderate and severe knee pain, respectively.
      Furthermore, a multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that serum
      creatinine (>1.5 mg/dL) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
      (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) were significantly associated with severe knee pain in OA
      patients. A significant correlation between severe knee pain and serum creatinine
      or eGFR was demonstrated by Pearson correlations.Taken together, the renal
      insufficiency defined by an elevated serum creatinine or a low eGFR in OA
      patients who required TKR was associated with severe knee pain. These variables
      must be considered while treating knee OA pain, especially in those patients with
      severe pain.

TI  - Early prediction of extubation failure in patients with severe pneumonia: a
      retrospective cohort study.
LID - BSR20192435
AB  - Backgroud: Severe pneumonia is one of the most common causes for mechanical
      ventilation. We aimed to early identify severe pneumonia patients with high risk 
      of extubation failure in order to improve prognosis.Methods: From April 2014 to
      December 2015, medical records of intubated patients with severe pneumonia in
      intensive care unit were retrieved from database. Patients were divided into
      extubation success and failure groups, and multivariate logistic regressions were
      performed to identify independent predictors for extubation failure.Results: A
      total of 125 eligible patients were included, of which 82 and 43 patients had
      extubation success and failure, respectively. APACHE II score (odds ratio (OR)
      1.141, 95% confident interval (CI) 1.022–1.273, P = 0.019, cutoff at 17.5), blood
      glucose (OR 1.122, 95%CI 1.008–1.249, P = 0.035, cutoff at 9.87 mmol/l), dose of 
      fentanyl (OR 3.010, 95%CI 1.100–8.237, P = 0.032, cutoff at 1.135 mg/d), and the 
      need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (OR 2.774, 95%CI 1.062–7.252, P =
      0.037) were independent risk factors for extubation failure.Conclusion: In
      patients with severe pneumonia, APACHE II score > 17.5, blood glucose > 9.87
      mmol/l, fentanyl usage > 1.135 mg/d, and the need for RBC transfusion might be
      associated with higher risk of extubation failure.

TI  - Buprenorphine to reverse respiratory depression from methadone overdose in
      opioid-dependent patients: a prospective randomized trial.
LID - 44
AB  - Background: Naloxone is the usual drug used in opioid-induced respiratory
      depression but it has a short half-life, precipitates withdrawal in dependent
      patients, and thus for persistent reversal of long-acting opioids has to be given
      by titrated doses and infusions. The partial agonist buprenorphine has a much
      longer duration of action and causes less severe withdrawal, but still should
      largely reverse respiratory depression induced by full agonist opioids. We aimed 
      to compare the efficacy/safety of buprenorphine and naloxone in reversing
      respiratory depression in methadone-poisoned opioid-dependent patients. Methods: 
      Patients with methadone-induced respiratory depression were randomized to receive
      naloxone (titrated doses), or lower or higher doses of buprenorphine (10 μg/kg or
      15 μg/kg). The primary outcome was immediate reversal of respiratory depression. 
      We also recorded acute opioid withdrawal, need for intubation/recurrent apnea,
      repeated doses of opioid antagonists, length of hospital stay, other morbidity,
      and mortality. The study was registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical
      Trials (Trial ID: 18265; Approval code: IRCT2015011020624N1). Results:
      Eighty-five patients were randomized; 55/56 patients who received buprenorphine
      had rapid reversal of respiratory depression, which persisted for at least 12 h. 
      Naloxone was effective in 28/29 patients, but often required very high titrated
      doses (thus delaying time to respond) and prolonged infusions. Intubation (8/29
      vs 5/56) and opioid withdrawal (15/29 vs 7/56) were less common with
      buprenorphine. There were no serious complications or deaths in those receiving
      buprenorphine. The 15-μg/kg buprenorphine dose appeared to provide a longer
      duration of action, but precipitated withdrawal more frequently than the 10-μg/kg
      dose. Conclusion: Buprenorphine appears to be a safe and effective substitute for
      naloxone in overdosed opioid-dependent patients. Further studies are warranted to
      explore the optimal dosing strategy for buprenorphine to consistently maintain
      reversal of respiratory depression but not precipitate withdrawal. Trial

TI  - Pain Assessment in Hemodialysis Patients.
LID - e6903
AB  - BackgroundPain is a common complaint among hemodialysis (HD) patients; however,
      most patients are not assessed for this aspect and are not sufficiently treated. 
      In these patients, pain is reported to be associated with a range of parameters
      like increased depression and disrupted quality of life (QOL). Previously
      residual renal function (RRF) was not assessed for associations with pain. The
      primary aim of the study is to evaluate the pain frequency in the Turkish HD
      patient population. In addition, the type, origin, and severity of chronic pain, 
      the pain treatment ratio, and the relationship between pain, QOL, and RRF were
      investigated during the study.MethodsThis study included 328 HD patients. Pain
      assessment used the McGill Pain Questionnaire and neuropathic pain assessment
      used the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) scale. The
      correlation of pain and quality of life was evaluated with the Short Form 36
      (SF-36) quality of life scale.ResultsOf patients, 244 experienced pain (74.4%),
      and this pain had a neuropathic character in 61.8% of these patients. Patients
      with pain had a longer dialysis duration than those without pain (4.00
      (2.00-8.00), 3.00 (2.00-4.75), p=0.01). The most common site of pain was the
      lower extremities. Pain was observed more often among females and with increasing
      age. Only 36.4% of patients used analgesics. The quality of life of patients with
      pain was found to be lower. The incidence of pain was higher among patients
      without RRF and had more neuropathic character.ConclusionsPain is a significant
      problem for the majority of HD patients and is not effectively managed. To
      increase the quality of life of patients, the care team should regularly question
      pain symptoms, and it should be treated effectively. In this context, RRF should 
      be regularly monitored and efforts should be made to preserve it.

TI  - “Dr. Google, I am in Pain”—Global Internet Searches Associated with Pain: A
      Retrospective Analysis of Google Trends Data.
LID - 954
AB  - We aimed to rank the most common locations of pain among Google users globally
      and locally and analyze secular and seasonal trends in pain-related searches in
      the years 2004–2019. We used data generated by Google Trends (GT) to identify and
      analyze global interest in topics (n = 24) related to locations of pain and how
      these progressed over time. We analyzed secular trends and time series
      decomposition to identify seasonal variations. We also calculated the interest in
      all topics with reference to the relative search volume (RSV) of “Abdominal
      pain”. Google users were most commonly interested in “Headache” (1.30 [times more
      frequently than “Abdominal pain”]), “Abdominal pain” (1.00), and “Back pain”
      (0.84). “Headache” was the most frequent search term in n = 41 countries, while
      “Abdominal pain” was the most frequent term in n = 27 countries. The interest in 
      all pain-related topics except “Dyspareunia” increased over time. The sharpest
      increase was observed for “Abdominal pain” (5.67 RSV/year), and “Toothache” (5.52
      RSV/year). Most of the topics revealed seasonal variations. Among pain-related
      topics, “Headache,” “Abdominal pain,” and “Back pain” interested most Google
      users. GT is a novel tool that allows retrospective investigation of complaints
      among Internet users.

TI  - High prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C viral
      infections among people who inject drugs: a potential stumbling block in the
      control of HIV and viral hepatitis in Tanzania.
LID - 177
AB  - Background: Tanzania has witnessed a significant decrease in the prevalence of
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and viral hepatitis in the general population 
      attributed to several interventional measures. It is uncertain whether this
      decline has also occurred among people who inject drugs (PWID). This study aimed 
      to determine the seroprevalence of HIV, Hepatitis B and C viruses infection among
      PWID recruited from their hotspot sites in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods: A
      cross-sectional study conducted between June and September 2017 recruited PWID
      from pre-identified hotspot sites using a snowball referral sampling technique. A
      structured questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding
      socio-demographic characteristics, behaviour and drug use. Blood was tested for
      the presence of IgG antibodies against HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and
      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Data were entered in the computer using
      excel software and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version
      20. Results: A total of 219 PWID were recruited, the majority of whom were males 
      (74.9%), unmarried (60.7%), had low education (62.6%) and low income (57.1%). The
      median age was 39 years, with an inter-quartile range of 35–43. Approximately
      32.0% had a history of drug injection for more than 3 years, 79.9% were injecting
      drugs more than 3 times per day and 47.5% were sharing needles. The overall
      prevalence of HIV, HBsAg, and HCV was 33.8, 7.8, and 50.2%, respectively. There
      was serologic evidence of at least one infection for 68.9%, while 22.4% had two
      or more infections. HIV infection was independently associated with being
      married, while HCV was associated with injecting drugs for more than 3 years and 
      unprotected sex. Conclusion: Over two-third of PWID had serologic evidence of
      infection with at least one virus while 22.4% having at least two infections. The
      high prevalence of HIV and viral hepatitis infections among PWID may hamper
      initiatives of ending HIV and viral hepatitis epidemics in Tanzania.

TI  - The Prevalence and Clinical Implications of Comorbid Back Pain in Shoulder
      Instability: A Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder
      Instability Cohort Study.
LID - 2325967119894738
AB  - Background:: Understanding predictors of pain is critical, as recent literature
      shows that comorbid back pain is an independent risk factor for worse functional 
      and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as well as increased opioid dependence after
      total joint arthroplasty. Purpose/Hypothesis:: The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate whether comorbid back pain would be predictive of pain or self-reported 
      instability symptoms at the time of stabilization surgery. We hypothesized that
      comorbid back pain will correlate with increased pain at the time of surgery as
      well as with worse scores on shoulder-related PRO measures. Study Design::
      Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods:: As part of the Multicenter
      Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder Instability cohort, patients
      consented to participate in pre- and intraoperative data collection. Demographic 
      characteristics, injury history, preoperative PRO scores, and radiologic and
      intraoperative findings were recorded for patients undergoing surgical shoulder
      stabilization. Patients were also asked, whether they had any back pain.
      Results:: The study cohort consisted of 1001 patients (81% male; mean age, 24.1
      years). Patients with comorbid back pain (158 patients; 15.8%) were significantly
      older (28.1 vs 23.4 years; P < .001) and were more likely to be female (25.3% vs 
      17.4%; P = .02) but did not differ in terms of either preoperative imaging or
      intraoperative findings. Patients with self-reported back pain had significantly 
      worse preoperative pain and shoulder-related PRO scores (American Shoulder and
      Elbow Surgeons score, Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index) (P < .001),
      more frequent depression (22.2% vs 8.3%; P < .001), poorer mental health status
      (worse scores for the RAND 36-Item Health Survey Mental Component Score, Iowa
      Quick Screen, and Personality Assessment Screener) (P < .01), and worse
      preoperative expectations (P < .01). Conclusion:: Despite having similar physical
      findings, patients with comorbid back pain had more severe preoperative pain and 
      self-reported symptoms of instability as well as more frequent depression and
      lower mental health scores. The combination of disproportionate shoulder pain,
      comorbid back pain and mental health conditions, and inferior preoperative
      expectations may affect not only the patient’s preoperative state but also
      postoperative pain control and/or postoperative outcomes.

TI  - Mobile Peer-Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine
      Learning Tool.
LID - e200001
AB  - Background:: The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not
      receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access 
      to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs
      turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related 
      information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and
      during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery
      programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as
      reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and 
      scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content
      moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or “trolling”); and lack
      common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care. Methods:: This 
      present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile 
      treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure,
      technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. Forty adults
      receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked to pilot a
      smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the “Marigold App”, for a
      duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study to
      obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative
      interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform.
      Anticipated findings and future directions:: The Marigold mobile platform will
      allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to
      different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and
      constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the
      emotional sentiment in messages, automatically “flagging” critical or clinically 
      relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools 
      by adapting them to catch OUD-specific “flags” in peer messages while also
      examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.

      programme at a psychiatric training hospital.
LID - 1255
AB  - Background: Comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders are common and
      present several treatment challenges. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine
      which patient and substance factors are associated with the completion of a
      substance rehabilitation programme in psychiatric inpatients. Setting: The study 
      was conducted at the Substance Rehabilitation Unit (SRU) at Weskoppies Hospital, 
      a psychiatric training hospital in South Africa, which offers a 6-week programme 
      at the hospital for psychiatric inpatients. Methods: This descriptive,
      retrospective hospital-based study was carried out comparing completers and
      non-completers of the SRU programme with respect to patient and substance
      factors. All patients accepted into the SRU during 2013–2014 were included (n =
      119). Data were collected over a year (2016–2017) from the clinical files, SRU
      referral forms, SRU attendance register, hospital computerised demographic
      records, nursing notes and administration files using a data collection sheet
      designed by the researchers for this study. Comparison between completers and
      non-completers was performed using Chi-Square or Fisher’s Exact tests. Results:
      The SRU accepted 119 patients from January 2013 to December 2014. The majority of
      the sample were involuntary patients (n = 39), 30–49 years old (n = 57), male (n 
      = 89), unmarried (n = 112), never having received a disability grant (n = 27),
      unemployed (n = 96) and with a Grade 8–11 education (n = 49). Substance-induced
      psychotic disorders (n = 39), schizophrenia (n = 29) and bipolar disorders (n =
      22) were found to be common. Frequent medical comorbidities included head injury 
      (n = 27), cardiovascular disease (n = 18) and HIV reactivity (n = 7). Cannabis (n
      = 98), alcohol (n = 94) and nicotine (n = 90) were the most frequently used
      substances. Level of education (p = 0.004), disability grant status (p = 0.004), 
      Nyaope use (p = 0.001) and nicotine use (p = 0.049) were statistically seen to be
      significantly associated with completion. Psychiatric diagnoses and general
      medical comorbidity were not associated with completion. Conclusions: This study 
      has yielded several results in areas that have not yet been well researched in
      South Africa. Risk factors for non-completion may include lower levels of
      education, being on a disability grant and using Nyaope or nicotine, but may vary
      in different settings. Future research should focus on identifying further
      factors that may affect completion of substance rehabilitation in psychiatric
      inpatients, the role of disability grants in patients with co-occurring disorders
      and the effect of Nyaope and nicotine use on treatment outcomes in this
      population. Effective and accessible interventions to assist vulnerable patients 
      also need to be identified.

TI  - Analgosedation for diagnostic and interventional procedures: a countrywide survey
      of pediatric centers in Germany.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: As more and more diagnostic and interventional options are becoming
      available for use in pediatric patients, techniques of procedural sedation
      analgesia (PSA) are being administered in considerably growing numbers as well.
      Aims: The objective of this research effort was to conduct the first countrywide 
      survey on the status quo of sedation analgesia as delivered to children and
      adolescents in Germany. Methods: We dispatched letters to all pediatric hospital 
      settings in Germany (n = 305), including a questionnaire that had been developed 
      with existing guidelines taken into account. Its items were designed to elucidate
      the current practice of PSA throughout these pediatric centers regarding (a)
      organizational structures and (b) standards of medication and staffing. Results: 
      A total of 138 centers returned the questionnaire, hence the response rate was
      45.2%. Numerous centers had implemented adequate structures and staffing
      standards. Deficits were nevertheless identified, most notably in terms of
      on-location equipment and staff provided to deliver sedations. Essential items of
      equipment were not provided in up to 26.8% of centers. Adequate staffing was not 
      provided in up to 44.2% of centers, depending on the diagnostic or interventional
      procedures for which the PSA was delivered. The most widely used sedative agents 
      were midazolam, ketamine/esketamine, and propofol. Conclusions: Adequate care
      structures for the management of procedural sedation analgesia have been
      implemented by many pediatric centers in Germany. On the downside, these findings
      also reveal deficits that will take efforts to be eliminated.

TI  - Variables associated with use of symptomatic medication during a headache attack 
      in individuals with tension-type headache: a European study.
LID - 43
AB  - Background: Pharmacological treatment of patients with tension-type headache
      (TTH) includes symptomatic (acute) and prophylactic (preventive) medication. No
      previous study has investigated variables associated to symptomatic medication
      intake in TTH. Our aim was to assess the association of clinical, psychological
      and neurophysiological outcomes with the use and timing of the use of symptomatic
      medication in TTH. Methods: A longitudinal observational study was conducted. One
      hundred and sixty-eight (n = 168) patients with TTH participated. Pain features
      of the headache (intensity, frequency, duration), burden of headache (Headache
      Disability Inventory), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index),
      anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), trait/state anxiety
      levels (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and bilateral pressure pain thresholds on
      the temporalis, C5-C6 joint, second metacarpal and tibialis anterior were
      assessed. Symptomatic medication intake was also collected for a 6-months
      follow-up period. Differences between patients using or not using symptomatic
      medication, depending on self-perceived effectiveness, and time (early during an 
      attack, i.e., the first 5 min, or when headache attack is intense) when the
      symptomatic medication was taken were calculated. Results: One hundred and
      thirty-six (n = 136, 80%) reported symptomatic medication intake for headache
      (73% NSAIDs). Sixteen (12%) reported no pain relief, 81 (59%) experienced
      moderate relief and 39 (29%) total pain relief. Fifty-eight (43%) took ‘early
      medication’ whereas 78 (57%) took ‘late medication’. Patients taking symptomatic 
      medication in general showed lower headache frequency and lower depressive levels
      than those patients not taking medication. Symptomatic medication was more
      effective in patients with lower headache history, frequency, and duration, and
      lower emotional burden. No differences in pressure pain sensitivity were found
      depending on the self-perceived effectiveness of medication. Patients taking
      ‘late symptomatic’ medication exhibited more widespread pressure pain sensitivity
      than those taking ‘early medication’. Conclusions: This study found that the
      effectiveness of symptomatic medication was associated with better headache
      parameters (history, frequency, or duration) and lower emotional burden. Further,
      consuming early symptomatic medication at the beginning of a headache attack (the
      first 5 min) could limit widespread pressure pain sensitivity.

TI  - Association Between a State Law Allowing Pharmacists to Dispense Naloxone Without
      a Prescription and Naloxone Dispensing Rates.
LID - e1920310
AB  - Question: Is an Ohio law allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a
      prescription in accordance with a physician-approved protocol associated with an 
      increase in naloxone dispensing rates? Findings: In this cohort study of patients
      in Ohio who received naloxone, the number of naloxone orders dispensed after the 
      state law was implemented increased by 2328%, and the naloxone dispensing rate
      per month per county increased significantly in the Ohio Medicaid (4%) and Kroger
      Pharmacy (3%) populations. In the Ohio Medicaid population, the naloxone
      dispensing rate in low-employment counties increased by 18% compared with
      high-employment counties. Meaning: The implementation of an Ohio law allowing
      pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a prescription was associated with a
      significant increase in naloxone dispensing rates, especially in low-employment
      counties.

TI  - Monitoring Consumption of Common Illicit Drugs in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, by
      Wastewater-Cased Epidemiology.
LID - 889
AB  - Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia play a major role in global drug
      trade and abuse. Use of amphetamine-type stimulants has increased in the past
      decade in Malaysia. This study aimed to apply wastewater-based epidemiology for
      the first time in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to estimate the consumption of common
      illicit drugs in urban population. Influent wastewater samples were collected
      from two wastewater treatment plants in Kuala Lumpur in the summer of 2017.
      Concentrations of twenty-four drug biomarkers were analyzed for estimating drug
      consumption. Fourteen drug residues were detected with concentrations of up to
      1640 ng/L. Among the monitored illicit drugs, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine 
      (MDMA) or ecstasy had the highest estimated per capita consumptions. Consumption 
      and dose of amphetamine-type stimulants (methamphetamine and MDMA) were both an
      order of magnitude higher than those of opioids (heroin and codeine, methadone
      and tramadol). Amphetamine-type stimulants were the most prevalent drugs,
      replacing opioids in the drug market. The prevalence trend measured by
      wastewater-based epidemiology data reflected the shift to amphetamine-type
      stimulants as reported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Narcotics
      Cooperation Center. Most of the undetected drug residues were new psychoactive
      substances (NPSs), suggesting a low prevalence of NPSs in the drug market.

TI  - Significant Quantitative Differences in Orexin Neuronal Activation After Pain
      Assessments in an Animal Model of Sickle Cell Disease.
LID - 5
AB  - Sickle cell disease is a hemoglobinopathy that causes sickling of red blood
      cells, resulting in vessel blockage, stroke, anemia, inflammation, and extreme
      pain. The development and treatment of pain, in particular, neuropathic pain in
      sickle cell disease patients is poorly understood and impedes our progress toward
      the development of novel therapies to treat pain associated with sickle cell
      disease. The orexin/hypocretin system offers a novel approach to treat chronic
      pain and hyperalgesia. These neuropeptides are synthesized in three regions:
      perifornical area (PFA), lateral hypothalamus (LH), and dorsomedial hypothalamus 
      (DMH). Data suggest that orexin–A neuropeptide has an analgesic effect on
      inflammatory pain and may affect mechanisms underlying the maintenance of
      neuropathic pain. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are
      neuronal activation differences in the orexin system as a result of neuropathic
      pain testing in a mouse model of sickle cell disease. Female transgenic sickle
      mice that express exclusively (99%) human sickle hemoglobin (HbSS-BERK) and
      age-/gender-matched controls (HbAA-BERK mice; n = 10/group, 20–30 g) expressing
      normal human hemoglobin A were habituated to each test protocol and environment
      before collecting baseline measurements and testing. Four measures were used to
      assess pain-related behaviors: thermal/heat hyperalgesia, cold hyperalgesia,
      mechanical hyperalgesia, and deep-tissue hyperalgesia. Hypothalamic brain
      sections from HbAA-BERK and HbSS-BERK mice were processed to visualize orexin and
      c-Fos immunoreactivity and quantified. The percentage of double labeled neurons
      in the PFA was significantly higher than the percentage of double labeled neurons
      in the LH orexin field of HbAA-BERK mice (*p < 0.05). The percentages of double
      labeled neurons in PFA and DMH orexin fields are significantly higher than those 
      neurons in the LH of HbSS-BERK mice (*p < 0.05). These data suggest that DMH
      orexin neurons were preferentially recruited during neuropathic pain testing and 
      a more diverse distribution of orexin neurons may be required to produce
      analgesia in response to pain in the HbSS-BERK mice. Identifying specific orexin 
      neuronal populations that are integral in neuropathic pain processing will allow 
      us to elucidate mechanisms that provide a more selective, targeted approach in
      treating of neuropathic pain in sickle cell disease.

TI  - Strategies for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease: Beyond Dopamine.
LID - 4
AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second-leading cause of dementia and is
      characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
      nigra alongside the presence of intraneuronal α-synuclein-positive inclusions.
      Therapies to date have been directed to the restoration of the dopaminergic
      system, and the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal cell death in the midbrain.
      This review discusses the physiological mechanisms involved in PD as well as new 
      and prospective therapies for the disease. The current data suggest that
      prevention or early treatment of PD may be the most effective therapeutic
      strategy. New advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of PD
      predict the development of more personalized and integral therapies in the years 
      to come. Thus, the development of more reliable biomarkers at asymptomatic stages
      of the disease, and the use of genetic profiling of patients will surely permit a
      more effective treatment of PD.

TI  - Increased risk of perforated appendicitis in patients with schizophrenia and
      dementia: A population-based case-control study.
LID - e18919
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that patients with psychotic or mental disorders 
      are relatively pain insensitive, resulting in difficulties in the diagnosis of
      acute intra-abdominal diseases requiring emergency surgeries. We aimed to
      evaluate whether central nervous system (CNS) or mental disorders are associated 
      with perforated appendicitis in patients with acute appendicitis.We conducted a
      population-based case-control study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance
      Research database. Patients aged >18 years who had been hospitalized with a
      diagnosis of acute appendicitis between 2000 and 2013 were identified. After 1:1 
      matching for age and sex, 2792 patients with perforated appendicitis (case group)
      and 2792 patients with nonperforated appendicitis (control group) were included. 
      CNS disorders, mental disorders, pain control medication, and several
      comorbidities were analyzed for the odds of appendiceal perforation with 95%
      confidence interval (CI) using the multivariable logistic regression
      model.Schizophrenia and dementia were associated with a high risk of appendiceal 
      rupture in patients with acute appendicitis, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.01 
      for dementia (95% CI: 1.19–3.39, P = .009) and 4.8 for schizophrenia (95% CI:
      1.62–14.19, P = .005). Other factors, such as other CNS disorders, comorbidities,
      and pain control medication, were not associated with the risk of perforated
      appendicitis.Dementia and schizophrenia are associated with perforated
      appendicitis in patients with acute appendicitis. This might be owing to altered 
      pain perception, difficult symptom expression, and delayed hospitalization.
      Further studies are still needed to determine the underlying mechanism and
      confirm the causality.

TI  - Midlife mortality in White non-Hispanic male veterans enrolled in Department of
      Veterans Affairs primary care, 2003–2014.
LID - e03328
AB  - Background: After years of decline in mortality rates in the United States, there
      have been increases in mortality rates in White non-Hispanic Americans ages
      45–54, due to increases in deaths from suicide, poisoning, and alcoholic liver
      disease. Objectives: To determine whether White non-Hispanic middle age male
      Veterans enrolled in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care had
      increased mortality, as found in the general population. Research design:
      Repeated cross-sectional analysis over 12 years to describe trends in death rates
      for men across 3 race/ethnicity groups (White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic,
      Hispanic) and 2 age groups (45–54, 55–64) for the Veteran and general US male
      populations. Subjects: 60 million patient-years for Veterans enrolled in VA
      primary care from 2003 to 2014 and 1.8 million who died during the study period. 
      Measures: All-cause and cause specific death rates for alcoholic liver disease,
      poisoning, and suicide. Results: For White non-Hispanic male Veterans ages 55–64,
      the increase in all-cause mortality from 2003 to 2014 (+309 deaths/100,000) was
      accompanied by significant changes in deaths due to poisoning (+30/100,000),
      alcoholic liver disease (+23/100,000), and suicide (+17/100,000). For US men ages
      55–64, all-cause mortality decreased slightly from 2003-2014 (-22
      deaths/100,000). However, there were increases in death rates due to poisoning
      (+17/100,000), alcoholic liver disease (+14/100,000) and suicide (+11/100,000).
      Conclusions: These disturbing findings for White non-Hispanic Veteran men ages
      55–64 suggest the critical importance of suicide prevention programs as well as
      the importance of high quality integrated health care for both Veteran and
      non-Veteran men.

TI  - Stratified analyses of genome wide association study data reveal haplotypes for a
      candidate gene on chromosome 2 (KIAA1211L) is associated with opioid use in
      patients of Arabian descent.
LID - 41
AB  - Background: Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been conducted to
      identify genes and pathways involved in development of opioid use disorder. This 
      study extends the first GWAS of substance use disorder (SUD) patients from the
      United Arab Emirates (UAE) by stratifying the study group based on opioid use,
      which is the most common substance of use in this cohort. Methods: The GWAS
      cohort consisted of 512 (262 case, 250 controls) male participants from the UAE. 
      The samples were genotyped using the Illumina Omni5 Exome system. Data was
      stratified according to opioid use using PLINK. Haplotype analysis was conducted 
      using Haploview 4.2. Results: Two main associations were identified in this
      study. Firstly, two SNPs on chromosome 7 were associated with opioid use
      disorder, rs118129027 (p-value = 1.23 × 10 − 8) and rs74477937
      (p-value = 1.48 × 10 − 8). This has been reported in Alblooshi et al. (Am J Med
      Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet 180(1):68–79, 2019). Secondly, haplotypes on
      chromosome 2 which mapped to the KIAA1211L locus were identified in association
      with opioid use. Five SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (rs2280142,
      rs6542837, rs12712037, rs10175560, rs11900524) were arranged into haplotypes. Two
      haplotypes GAGCG and AGTTA were associated with opioid use disorders (p-value
      3.26 × 10− 8 and 7.16 × 10− 7, respectively). Conclusion: This is the first GWAS 
      to identify candidate genes associated with opioid use disorder in participants
      from the UAE. The lack of other genetic data of Arabian descent opioid use
      patients has hindered replication of the findings. Nevertheless, the outcomes
      implicate new pathways in opioid use disorder that requires further research to
      assess the role of the identified genes in the development of opioid use
      disorder.

TI  - The National Ambulance Surveillance System: A novel method for monitoring acute
      alcohol, illicit and pharmaceutical drug related-harms using coded Australian
      ambulance clinical records.
LID - e0228316
AB  - Although harmful consumption of alcohol and other drugs (both illicit and
      pharmaceutical) significantly contribute to global burden of disease, not all
      harms are captured within existing morbidity data sources. Indeed, harms
      occurring in the community may be missed or under-reported. This paper describes 
      the National Ambulance Surveillance System, a unique Australian system for
      monitoring and mapping acute harms related to alcohol and other drug consumption.
      Data are sourced from paramedic electronic patient care records provided by
      ambulance services from across Australia. Coding occurs in a purpose-built
      system, by a team of specialised research assistants. Alcohol, and specific
      illicit and pharmaceutical drugs, rather than broad drug classes, are manually
      coded and the dataset is reviewed and cleaned prior to analysis. The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an ongoing, dynamic surveillance system of
      alcohol and other drug-related harms across Australia. The data includes more
      than 140 output variables per attendance, including individual substances,
      demographics, temporal, geospatial, and clinical data (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale
      score, naloxone provision and response, outcome of attendance). The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an internationally unique population-level
      surveillance system of acute harms arising from alcohol and other drug
      consumption. Dissemination of National Ambulance Surveillance System data has
      been used to inform and evaluate policy approaches and potential points of
      intervention, as well as guide workforce development needs and clinical practice 
      at the local and national level. This methodology could be replicated in other
      countries.

TI  - Adapting a peer recovery coach-delivered behavioral activation intervention for
      problematic substance use in a medically underserved community in Baltimore City.
LID - e0228084
AB  - Low-income, racial/ethnic minority groups have disproportionately high rates of
      problematic substance use yet face barriers in accessing evidence-based
      interventions (EBIs). Peer recovery coaches (PRCs), individuals with lived
      experience with problematic substance use, may provide an effective approach to
      reaching these individuals. Traditionally PRCs have focused on bridging to other 
      types of care rather than delivering EBIs themselves. The aim of this study was
      to assess perceptions of the appropriateness of a PRC-delivered adapted
      behavioral activation (BA) intervention to reduce problematic substance use for
      individuals not engaged in care. This study was conducted at a community resource
      center in Baltimore, Maryland serving low-income and homeless clients who have
      high rates of problematic substance use yet also face barriers to accessing care.
      Guided by the ADAPT-ITT framework, we conducted semi-structured key informant
      interviews with clients (n = 30) with past or present problematic substance use, 
      and a focus group with community providers, including staff at the community
      resource center (n = 5) and PRCs (n = 6) from the community. Thirty percent (n = 
      9) of clients interviewed reported past problematic substance use and 70% (n =
      21) met criteria for current use, most commonly cocaine and opioids. Clients,
      center staff, and PRCs shared that PRC-delivered BA could be acceptable and
      appropriate with suggested adaptations, including adding peer-delivered
      case-management and linkage to care alongside BA, and tailoring BA to include
      activities that are accessible and feasible in the community. These findings will
      inform the adaptation of PRC-delivered BA to address problematic substance use in
      this setting.

TI  - Role of Oxycodone Hydrochloride in Treating Radiotherapy-Related Pain.
LID - 7565962
AB  - Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat cancer patients. Besides the curable
      effect, radiotherapy also could relieve the pain of cancer patients. However,
      cancer pain is gradually alleviated about two weeks after radiotherapy. In
      addition, cancer patients who receive radiotherapy may also suffer from pain
      flare or radiotherapy-induced side effects such as radiation esophagitis,
      enteritis, and mucositis. Pain control is reported to be inadequate during the
      whole course of radiotherapy (before, during, and after radiotherapy), and
      quality of life is seriously affected. Hence, radiotherapy is suggested to be
      combined with analgesic drugs in clinical guidelines. Previous studies have shown
      that radiotherapy combined with oxycodone hydrochloride can effectively alleviate
      cancer pain. In this review, we firstly presented the necessity of analgesia
      during the whole course of radiotherapy. We also sketched the role of oxycodone
      hydrochloride in radiotherapy of bone metastases and radiotherapy-induced oral
      mucositis. Finally, we concluded that oxycodone hydrochloride shows good efficacy
      and tolerance and could be used for pain management before, during, and after
      radiotherapy.

TI  - Cannabis and Cannabinoids in the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases.
LID - e0007
AB  - Chronic pain is a common complaint among patients, and rheumatic diseases are a
      common cause for chronic pain. Current pharmacological interventions for chronic 
      pain are not always useful or safe enough for long-term use. Cannabis and
      cannabinoids are currently being studied due to their potential as analgesics. In
      this review we will discuss current literature regarding cannabinoids and
      cannabis as treatment for rheumatic diseases. Fibromyalgia is a prevalent
      rheumatic disease that causes diffuse pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.
      Treatment of this syndrome is symptomatic, and it has been suggested that
      cannabis and cannabinoids could potentially alleviate some of the symptoms
      associated with fibromyalgia. In this review we cite some of the evidence that
      supports this claim. However, data on long-term efficacy and safety of
      cannabinoid and cannabis use are still lacking. Cannabinoids and cannabis are
      commonly investigated as analgesic agents, but in recent years more evidence has 
      accumulated on their potential immune-modulatory effect, supported by results in 
      animal models of certain rheumatic diseases. While results that demonstrate the
      same effect in humans are still lacking, cannabinoids and cannabis remain
      potential drugs to alleviate the pain associated with rheumatic diseases, as they
      were shown to be safe and to cause limited adverse effects.

TI  - Cannabis and Pain Treatment—A Review of the Clinical Utility and a Practical
      Approach in Light of Uncertainty.
LID - e0002
AB  - Over the past decade the phenomenon of cannabis as a legitimate form of treatment
      for pain has overwhelmed the medical community, especially in the field of pain. 
      From a status of a schedule 1 substance having no currently accepted medical use 
      and being considered to have high potential for abuse, its use has mushroomed to 
      over 50,000 legal medical users per year in Israel alone. There appear to be many
      reasons behind this phenomenon—medical, sociological, and economical. Thus, what 
      is cannabis? An abusive substance or a medication? Should it be incorporated into
      current biomedical practice, and how should it be administered? Finally, what is 
      the evidence for the beneficial and detrimental effects of cannabis? This article
      reviews and discusses the current literature regarding the beneficial and the
      detrimental effects of medical cannabis in the treatment of pain. We further
      discuss the problems and challenges facing the medical community in this domain
      and offer a practical approach to deal with these challenges.

TI  - Spinal versus General Anesthesia for Patients with Parkinson’s Disease.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - Background: Anesthesiologists prefer using general anesthesia (GA) in Parkinson’s
      disease (PD). However, GA may mask neurological symptoms in the intraoperative
      period and exacerbate them postoperatively. Furthermore, the anesthetics used in 
      GA have clear interactions with the drugs used to control PD. On the other hand, 
      drugs used in spinal anesthesia (SA) might be safer for patients with PD. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the effect of SA and GA in patients with PD who
      underwent hip fracture repairs. Methods: Retrospectively, we identified those
      patients with PD who were admitted due to hip joint fracture. The following
      information were obtained: demographics, preoperative assessment information of
      the patients, type of anesthesia, and types of fractures and orthopedic
      procedures. In addition, intraoperative and postoperative complications were
      studied. The patients were divided based on the type of anesthesia received and
      were compared. Results: Ten (8 males) patients with PD who underwent hip fracture
      surgery included in the study. Six patients received SA and 4 patients received
      GA. The mean age was 73.2 years. The preoperative assessment was not significant 
      for all patients. Postoperatively, within the inpatient period, 3 out of 4
      patients received GA developed complications (two atelectasis and urinary tract
      infection) while no patient developed complication from the SA group.
      Postoperative outpatient complications within one-month included 3 out of 4 cases
      in the GA group and only one complication in the SA group. The mean
      hospitalization period was 9 days for patients received GA and 5.8 days for
      patients received SA. Conclusion: This study reported less perioperative
      complications in the SA. Accordingly, further investigations and rp-randomized
      controlled trials evaluating various anesthetic techniques or drugs are needed.

TI  - Teriparatide in East Asian Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis in a Real-World
      Setting: A Baseline Analysis of the Asia and Latin America Fracture Observational
      Study (ALAFOS).
PG  - 111-21
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this analysis is to describe the baseline characteristics of 
      patients who are prescribed teriparatide for the treatment of postmenopausal
      osteoporosis in a real-world setting in East Asia. Patients and Methods: The Asia
      and Latin America Fracture Observational Study (ALAFOS) is a prospective,
      multinational, observational study designed to evaluate real-world use of
      teriparatide in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 20 countries
      across Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia. This subregional
      analysis focuses on the East Asian subpopulation of the ALAFOS study. Here we
      report baseline clinical characteristics, details regarding the history of
      fractures, risk factors for osteoporosis, comorbidities, osteoporosis treatment, 
      and health-related quality of life in patients enrolled in China, Hong Kong,
      South Korea, and Taiwan. Results: The East Asian subgroup of ALAFOS included 1136
      postmenopausal women, constituting 37.5% (1136/3031) of the overall ALAFOS
      patient population. The mean (SD) age was 75.0 (9.6) years. The mean (SD) bone
      mineral density T-scores were −3.11 (1.54), −2.58 (1.11), and −2.86 (1.09) at the
      lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, respectively; 69.6% of patients had
      experienced at least one fragility fracture and 40.4% had experienced ≥2
      fragility fractures after 40 years of age. Overall, 63.3% of patients had used
      medications for osteoporosis in the past. The mean (SD) EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS) score at baseline was 59.7 (20.8); the mean (SD) back pain numeric
      rating scale score for worst pain in the last 24 hrs was 5.2 (3.2). Conclusion:
      Our results indicate that patients who are prescribed teriparatide in East Asia
      were elderly women with severe osteoporosis, low bone mineral density, high
      prevalence of fractures, back pain and poor health-related quality of life. Most 
      of the patients received teriparatide as a second-line treatment.

TI  - Randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-centre study to assess the
      efficacy, tolerability and safety of Enterosgel® in the treatment of irritable
      bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) in adults.
LID - 122
AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a common and
      chronic condition that can significantly impair quality of life. The emergence of
      new drugs for IBS-D has been slow and there is a need for new treatments,
      including drug-free treatments, which are easy to use and suitable for different 
      patient groups. Currently available drug-free treatments include Enterosgel®, an 
      intestinal adsorbent approved for use in IBS-D and acute diarrhoea and available 
      over-the-counter in the UK and 30 countries worldwide. The aim of this
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study is to test the
      efficacy and safety of Enterosgel® compared to placebo in symptomatic treatment
      in IBS-D. Methods/design: We will recruit 430 participants with IBS-D from
      approximately 30 primary and secondary care sites in England. Participants
      meeting the required abdominal pain and stool consistency criteria over a 2-week 
      screening period will be randomly allocated to receive blinded treatment
      (Enterosgel® or placebo) for 8 weeks. This will be followed by an 8-week
      open-label treatment phase with Enterosgel®. Participants will be allowed to
      adjust their daily dosage during both phases based on their symptoms.
      Participants will then return to standard care and those who responded to
      treatment will receive a follow-up call 8 weeks later. Co-medication with
      loperamide will be permitted and use recorded. The primary outcome measure is the
      percentage of participants defined as responders for abdominal pain and stool
      consistency during at least 4 weeks in the 8-week blinded phase. Secondary
      outcome measures include stool frequency, stool consistency, abdominal pain,
      bloating, urgency, adequate relief, questionnaire scores and rescue medication
      use. Exploratory outcomes will be assessed in subsets of participants including
      qualitative and quantitative data on faecal microorganisms and biomarkers and
      gut-related measurements from magnetic resonance imaging data. Discussion: This
      is the first large scale randomised controlled trial investigating Enterosgel® in
      IBS-D. A study design with blinded phase followed by an open-label phase was
      chosen to encourage participation and study completion. Demonstrating that
      Enterosgel® is effective and safe in IBS-D could encourage adoption by patients
      and healthcare professionals and foster future clinical trials assessing its use 
      in related conditions. Trial registration: ISRCTN17149988. Prospectively
      registered on 14 November 2017.

TI  - Nonunion – consensus from the 4th annual meeting of the Danish Orthopaedic Trauma
      Society.
PG  - 46-57
AB  - Nonunions are a relevant economic burden affecting about 1.9% of all fractures.
      Rather than specifying a certain time frame, a nonunion is better defined as a
      fracture that will not heal without further intervention.Successful fracture
      healing depends on local biology, biomechanics and a variety of systemic factors.
      All components can principally be decisive and determine the classification of
      atrophic, oligotrophic or hypertrophic nonunions. Treatment prioritizes mechanics
      before biology.The degree of motion between fracture parts is the key for healing
      and is described by strain theory. If the change of length at a given load is >
      10%, fibrous tissue and not bone is formed. Therefore, simple fractures require
      absolute and complex fractures relative stability.The main characteristics of a
      nonunion are pain while weight bearing, and persistent fracture lines on
      X-ray.Treatment concepts such as ‘mechanobiology’ or the ‘diamond concept’
      determine the applied osteosynthesis considering soft tissue, local biology and
      stability. Fine wire circular external fixation is considered the only form of
      true biologic fixation due to its ability to eliminate parasitic motions while
      maintaining load-dependent axial stiffness. Nailing provides intramedullary
      stability and biology via reaming. Plates are successful when complex fractures
      turn into simple nonunions demanding absolute stability. Despite available
      alternatives, autograft is the gold standard for providing osteoinductive and
      osteoconductive stimuli.The infected nonunion remains a challenge. Bacteria,
      especially staphylococcus species, have developed mechanisms to survive such as
      biofilm formation, inactive forms and internalization. Therefore, radical
      debridement and specific antibiotics are necessary prior to reconstruction.Cite

TI  - PRESCRIPTION OPIOID MISUSE MOTIVE LATENT CLASSES: OUTCOMES FROM A NATIONALLY
      REPRESENTATIVE US SAMPLE.
PG  - e97
AB  - Aims:: Prescription opioid misuse (POM) contributes to a larger opioid crisis in 
      the US and Canada, with over 17,000 US POM-related overdose deaths in 2017. Our
      aims were to 1) identify specific profiles of respondents based on POM motives
      using the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and 2) compare
      profile respondents on sociodemographics, substance use and mental and physical
      health outcomes. Methods:: Analyses included 2017-18 NSDUH respondents with data 
      on POM motives (n= 4,810). POM was defined as prescription opioid use in a way
      not intended by the prescriber, including use without a prescription, in larger
      amounts or more frequently. Nine POM motives for the most recent episode were
      assessed, including “to relieve physical pain” and “to get high”. Latent classes,
      based on POM motives, were estimated. Classes were compared on sociodemographics,
      substance use, physical and mental health outcomes. Results:: Eight latent
      classes were identified (in order of prevalence): pain relief only, relax-pain
      relief, sleep-pain relief, multi-motive, high, experimenter, emotional coping,
      and dependent/hooked. Compared to the pain relief only group, the high and
      multi-motive classes had higher odds of all substance use outcomes, with the
      dependent/hooked class having higher odds on all but one outcome. Six of the
      eight classes had higher odds of past-year mental health treatment and suicidal
      ideation than the pain relief only class. Conclusions:: Screening for pain, pain 
      conditions, problematic substance use and psychopathology are recommended in
      those with any POM. While those in the dependent/hooked, multi-motive, and
      emotional coping classes are most likely to have prescription opioid use
      disorder, screening for opioid use disorder symptoms in all individuals with POM 
      is also warranted.

TI  - Responses to addiction help-seeking from Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, 
      and Bixby intelligent virtual assistants.
LID - 11
AB  - We investigated how intelligent virtual assistants (IVA), including Amazon’s
      Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Samsung’s Bixby, 
      responded to addiction help-seeking queries. We recorded if IVAs provided a
      singular response and if so, did they link users to treatment or treatment
      referral services. Only 4 of the 70 help-seeking queries presented to the five
      IVAs returned singular responses, with the remainder prompting confusion (e.g.,
      “did I say something wrong?”). When asked “help me quit drugs” Alexa responded
      with a definition for the word drugs. “Help me quit…smoking” or “tobacco” on
      Google Assistant returned Dr. QuitNow (a cessation app), while on Siri “help me
      quit pot” promoted a marijuana retailer. IVAs should be revised to promote free, 
      remote, federally sponsored addiction services, such as SAMSHA’s 1-800-662-HELP
      helpline. This would benefit millions of IVA users now and more to come as IVAs
      displace existing information-seeking engines.

TI  - A Census of Medicolegal Death Investigation in the United States: A Need to
      Determine the State of our Nation’s Toxicology Laboratories and Their
      Preparedness for the Current Drug Overdose Epidemic†, ‡.
PG  - 544-9
AB  - In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported on 2004 data collected from
      the Census of Medical Examiner and Coroner Offices (CMEC). The CMEC was one of
      the first comprehensive reports on the state of the medicolegal death
      investigation system in the United States and included information on
      administration, expenditure, workload, specialized death investigations, records 
      and evidence retention, and resources. However, the report did not include
      responses on questions that were related to toxicology such as specimen retention
      and type of testing. The purpose of this publication is to provide the community 
      with toxicology laboratory‐specific responses from nearly 2000 medical examiner
      and coroner (MEC) offices. Data obtained from a BJS CMEC public use dataset for
      any remaining information that was not reported in the 2007 BJS report were
      evaluated specific to the operation of toxicology laboratories within a MEC
      office or specific to toxicology testing. The CMEC includes information on
      average operating budget for MEC offices with internal or external toxicology
      services, budget for toxicology/microbiology services, respondents’ routine uses 
      of toxicology analysis, toxicology specimen retention time, average turnaround
      times, use of computerized information management systems, and participation in
      federal data collections. These historical data begin to address the present
      state of our nation’s toxicology laboratories within the medicolegal death
      investigation system and their preparedness for the current drug overdose
      epidemic.

TI  - Economic Evaluation of Hepatitis C Treatment Extension to Acute Infection and
      Early-Stage Fibrosis Among Patients Who Inject Drugs in Developing Countries: A
      Case of China.
LID - 800
AB  - We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of (1) treating acute hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) vs. deferring treatment until the chronic phase and (2) treating all
      chronic patients vs. only those with advanced fibrosis; among Chinese genotype 1b
      treatment-naïve patients who injected drugs (PWID), using a combination
      Daclatasvir (DCV) plus Asunaprevir (ASV) regimen and a Peg-interferon
      (PegIFN)-based regimen, respectively. A decision-analytical model including the
      risk of HCV reinfection simulated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
      (QALYs) of three treatment timings, under the DCV+ASV and PegIFN regimen,
      respectively: Treating acute infection (“Treat at acute”), treating chronic
      patients of all fibrosis stages (“Treat at F0 (no fibrosis)”), treating only
      advanced-stage fibrosis patients (“Treat at F3 (numerous septa without
      cirrhosis)”). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to compare 
      scenarios. “Treat at acute” compared with “Treat at F0” was cost-saving (cost:
      DCV+ASV regimen—US$14,486.975 vs. US$16,224.250; PegIFN-based
      regimen—US$19,734.794 vs. US$22,101.584) and more effective (QALY: DCV+ASV
      regimen—14.573 vs. 14.566; PegIFN-based regimen—14.148 vs. 14.116). Compared with
      “Treat at F3”; “Treat at F0” exhibited an ICER of US$3780.20/QALY and
      US$15,145.98/QALY under the DCV+ASV regimen and PegIFN-based regimen;
      respectively. Treatment of acute HCV infection was highly cost-effective and
      cost-saving compared with deferring treatment to the chronic stage; for both
      DCV+ASV and PegIFN-based regimens. Early treatment for chronic patients with
      DCV+ASV regimen was highly cost-effective.

TI  - Viral infections of oral cavity.
PG  - 36-42
AB  - Viral infections of the oral cavity usually manifest as either ulceration or
      blistering presentation of oral tissues. Oral viral infections are encountered in
      dental practice but received less clinical interest due to the lesser frequency
      of patients and diagnostic challenges. The clinical presentation, pathogenic
      mechanism, investigations, and management of oral viral infections are integrated
      into the article which will enable general dentists to develop critical thinking 
      processes on differential diagnosis and management through a multidisciplinary
      approach with specialist dentists.

TI  - Neuromuscular blockade in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: Neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) has been proposed by medical
      guidelines for early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) because of
      its survival benefits. However, new studies have provided evidence contradicting 
      these results. Method: A search was performed of the Pubmed, Scopus,
      Clinicaltrials.gov, and Virtual Health Library databases for randomized
      controlled trials (RCT) evaluating 28-day mortality in ARDS patients treated with
      NMBA within 48 h. An English language restriction was applied. Relevant data were
      extracted and pooled into risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effect model.
      Sensitivity and meta-regression analysis were performed. Results: From 2675
      studies, we included five RCTs in the analysis, for a total of 1461 patients with
      a mean PaO2/FIO2 of 104 ± 35 mmHg. The cisatracurium group had the same risk of
      death at 28 days (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78–1.03; I2 = 50%, p = 0.12) and 90 days
      (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62–1.06; I2 = 56%, p = 0.06) as the control group (no
      cisatracurium). The secondary outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration and
      ventilator-free days were not different between the two groups. Cisatracurium had
      a significantly lower risk of barotrauma than the control group with no
      difference in intensive care unit (ICU)–induced weakness. The PaO2/FIO2 ratio was
      higher in the cisatracurium group but not until 48 h. Meta-regression analysis of
      the baseline PaO2/FIO2 ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) revealed no
      heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis excluding the trial using high PEEP and light
      sedation strategy yielded an improvement in all mortality outcomes. Conclusion:
      NMBA improves oxygenation only after 48 h in moderate, severe ARDS patients and
      has a lower barotrauma risk without affecting ICU weakness. However, NMBA does
      not reduce ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation or, most
      importantly, the mortality risk regardless of the severity of ARDS.

TI  - A Collaborative Medication Review Including Deprescribing for Older Patients in
      an Emergency Department: A Longitudinal Feasibility Study.
LID - 348
AB  - Medication review for older patients with polypharmacy in the emergency
      department (ED) is crucial to prevent inappropriate prescribing. Our objective
      was to assess the feasibility of a collaborative medication review in older
      medical patients (≥65 years) using polypharmacy (≥5 long-term medications). A
      pharmacist performed the medication review using the tools: Screening Tool of
      Older Persons’ potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria, a
      drug–drug interaction database (SFINX), and Renbase® (renal dosing database). A
      geriatrician received the medication review and decided which recommendations
      should be implemented. The outcomes were: differences in Medication
      Appropriateness Index (MAI) and Assessment of Underutilization Index (AOU) scores
      between admission and 30 days after discharge and the percentage of patients for 
      which the intervention was completed before discharge. Sixty patients were
      included from the ED, the intervention was completed before discharge for 50
      patients (83%), and 39 (61.5% male; median age 80 years) completed the follow-up 
      30 days after discharge. The median MAI score decreased from 14 (IQR 8-20) at
      admission to 8 (IQR 2-13) 30 days after discharge (p < 0.001). The number of
      patients with an AOU score ≥1 was reduced from 36% to 10% (p < 0.001). Thirty
      days after discharge, 83% of the changes were sustained and for 28 patients
      (72%), 1≥ medication had been deprescribed. In conclusion, a collaborative
      medication review and deprescribing intervention is feasible to perform in the
      ED.

TI  - Chronic femoral diaphyseal osteomyelitis with radiographs initially concerning
      for Paget disease of the bone.
PG  - 344-8
AB  - Chronic osteomyelitis can be difficult to diagnose given its similar radiographic
      appearance to other lesions. This case report describes a 48-year-old woman, who 
      presented with left thigh pain and on radiography a large disorganized sclerotic 
      lesion involving nearly the entire femoral diaphysis, concerning for Paget
      disease or malignancy. Biopsy suggested chronic osteomyelitis but did not
      identify a causative organism. Treatment with antibiotics led to resolution of
      pain and improvement of biochemical markers. This case exemplifies the role of
      radiographic imaging in the diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis and the possible
      utility of antibiotics for culture-negative chronic osteomyelitis. We review
      imaging modalities for the diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis and Paget disease.

TI  - Improving opioid guideline adherence: evaluation of a multifaceted,
      theory-informed pilot intervention for family physicians.
LID - e032167
AB  - Objectives: Opioid-related deaths continue to increase in North America, an
      epidemic that was initiated by high rates of opioid prescribing. We designed a
      multifaceted, theory-informed Opioid Self-Assessment (OSA) package, to increase
      adherence to the Canadian Opioid Guideline among family physicians. This study
      aimed to assess changes in Canadian family physicians’ knowledge and practices
      after completing the OSA package. Design: We conducted a mixed-method evaluation 
      using a pre-test and post-test design that involved the collection of both
      qualitative and quantitative data. Setting: This research was conducted in the
      primary care setting in Ontario, Canada. Participants: We recruited a purposive
      sample of nine family physicians in Ontario who use long-term opioid therapy to
      treat patients with chronic pain. Interventions: The OSA package included four
      components: an online knowledge test, an online learning programme, a safe
      medication practice self-assessment questionnaire and chart audit with feedback. 
      Outcome measures: Our measures included changes in knowledge, opioid safety
      practices and physicians’ perspectives on the OSA package. Results: We found
      statistically significant improvements between pre-test and post-test knowledge
      scores at both baseline and 6-month follow-up. Physicians’ scores improved
      significantly on five of the seven core characteristics of the practice
      self-assessment questionnaire. On the chart audits, we observed an improvement in
      patient education between baseline and 6 months. Qualitative interviews showed
      that participants appreciated embedded resources in the OSA package. The
      completion of the package stimulated identification of gaps or deficits in
      practice and served as a useful reminder to discuss risk and safety with
      patients. Participants described the chart review as helpful in prompting
      discussions with their patients, identifying deficits and strengths and a
      ‘primary motivator’ for project participation. Conclusions: The OSA package has
      the potential to improve medication safety practices in primary care related to
      opioid monitoring and adherence to current opioid guidelines.

TI  - Problematic Internet Use, Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs, and Depressive
      Symptoms among Adolescents: A Large-Scale Study in China.
LID - 774
AB  - This large-scale study aimed to test, among Chinese adolescents, the association 
      between problematic Internet use (PIU), non-medical use of prescription drugs
      (NMUPD), and depressive symptoms, as well as the mediating effects of NMUPD on
      the associations above. This study used the data from the 2017 National
      School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey, and 24,345 students’
      questionnaires qualified for the analyses. Generalized linear mixed models and
      path models were performed. In the models without mediation, PIU was associated
      with depressive symptoms (unstandardized β estimate = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.25–0.27); 
      frequent use of opioid or sedative was also related to depressive symptoms
      (unstandardized β estimate for opioid = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.90–3.63; unstandardized 
      β estimate for sedative = 4.45, 95% CI = 3.02–5.88). Additionally, the results of
      the path models indicated that opioid misuse partially mediated the association
      between PIU and depressive symptoms. PIU and opioid/sedative misuse were related 
      to the increased risk of depressive symptoms, respectively. The association above
      might be complicated, and PIU may elevate the risk of opioid or sedative misuse
      and depressive symptoms, which in turn could worsen the situation of PIU and vice
      versa. Multidisciplinary health intervention programs to prevent adolescents
      involving in PIU, as well as NMPUD, are recommended to be provided.

TI  - Transdiagnostic or Disorder Specific? Indicators of Substance and Behavioral
      Addictions Nominated by People with Lived Experience.
LID - 334
AB  - Using a transdiagnostic perspective, the present research examined the prominent 
      indicators of substance (alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, tobacco) and behavioral
      (gambling, video games, sex, shopping, work, eating) addictions nominated by
      people with lived experiences. Specifically, we aimed to explore whether the
      perceived most important indicators nominated were consistent across the 10
      addictions or differed based on the specific addiction. Additionally, we explored
      gender differences in the perceived most important indicators across addictive
      behaviors. A large online sample of adults recruited from a Canadian province (n 
      = 3503) were asked to describe the most important signs or symptoms of problems
      with these substances and behaviors. Open-ended responses were analyzed among a
      subsample of 2603 respondents (n = 1562 in the past year) who disclosed that they
      had personally experienced a problem with at least one addiction listed above.
      Content analyses revealed that dependence (e.g., craving, impairments in control)
      and patterns of use (e.g., frequency) were the most commonly perceived indicators
      for both substance and behavioral addictions, accounting for over half of all the
      qualitative responses. Differences were also found between substance and
      behavioral addictions regarding the proportion of the most important signs
      nominated. Consistent with the syndrome model of addiction, unique indicators
      were also found for specific addictive behaviors, with the greatest proportion of
      unique indicators found for eating. Supplemental analyses found that perceived
      indicators across addictions were generally gender invariant. Results provide
      some support for a transdiagnostic conceptualization of substance and behavioral 
      addictions. Implications for the study, prevention, and treatment of addictions
      are discussed.

TI  - Clinicians Beware, Ewing’s Sarcoma After 60 Is Elusive and Rare!
LID - e6768
AB  - Ewing’s sarcoma is the second most common malignant bone tumor in children, with 
      the worst outcomes seen in patients over the age of 20. However, the onset of the
      disease is much less common in people over the age of 30. This case represents
      the diagnostic dilemma posed by an otherwise “straight forward” case of back
      pain. Keeping the differential diagnosis sufficiently broad to include bone
      malignancies, so as not to delay diagnosis and treatment, provides the best
      chance at a positive outcome.

TI  - Effectiveness of supervised early exercise program in patients with arthroscopic 
      rotator cuff repair: Study protocol clinical trial.
LID - e18846
AB  - Background:: Based on the available evidence, it is difficult to make a clinical 
      decision about the best exercise program and to establish the most favorable time
      to start postoperative treatment after rotator cuff (RC) repair. The aim of this 
      trial is to evaluate the effects of adding a supervised early exercise program to
      standard treatment for functional improvement and pain relief compared with
      standard treatment alone in patients with arthroscopic RC repair. Method/design::
      A total of 118 patients between the ages of 18 and 50 years with arthroscopic RC 
      repair will be randomized to 2 treatment arms. The control group will receive a
      standard exercise program based on a consensus statement on shoulder
      rehabilitation developed by the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow
      Therapists. The intervention group will receive a supervised early exercise
      program in combination with standard treatment. This supervised exercise program 
      will be based on electromyographic evidence. Three evaluations will be performed:
      before surgery, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be 
      the shoulder function by the Constant–Murley questionnaire, and the secondary
      outcome measures will be the upper limb function by the disabilities of the arm, 
      shoulder, and hand questionnaire; pain by the visual analog scale; and the
      shoulder range of motion by a goniometer. Discussion:: We hypothesize that
      patients who receive a supervised early exercise program in combination with
      standard treatment will benefit more in respect to shoulder function, pain
      reduction, and range of motion than those who receive a standard exercise
      program. If this is confirmed, our study can be used clinically to enhance the
      recovery of patients with arthroscopic RC repair. Trial registration:: Brazilian 
      registry of clinical trials UTN number U1111-1224-4143. Registered December 18,

      disabilities and ADHD.
LID - 212601
AB  - Background: We evaluated Gamalate® B6 (GB6) in patients with borderline
      intellectual functioning (BIF) or mild intellectual development disability (IDD).
      Patients and methods: This was a prospective phase IV observational pilot study
      in 30 patients who underwent neuropsychological evaluation during treatment with 
      GB6 for 12 weeks. Results: In comparison with baseline, the responses were
      positive, with a significant improvement in hyperactivity (51.7%), irritability
      (35.5%), and logorrhea (50%), and no sedative effect. The Clinical Global
      Impressions – Severity (CGI-S) score was much improved or very much improved in
      73% of cases. Reaction time was better with fewer errors, thus indicating an
      improvement in attentional processes. A statistically significant result was
      obtained for the number of movements used to solve the problem and for the total 
      number of correctly solved problems. Conclusion: In this pilot study, GB6 was
      effective and well tolerated in cases of ADHD and challenging behavior in young
      adults with borderline-to-mild BIF/IDD. However, given the small number of
      patients involved and the uncontrolled nature of the study, these results should 
      be viewed cautiously.

TI  - Unintentional Drug-related Deaths in Cambridgeshire: A Retrospective
      Observational Study.
LID - e6750
AB  - Background: Drug-related deaths are a growing public health problem in the United
      Kingdom, overtaking road fatalities and homicides in terms of annual deaths. In
      this study, we investigated the causes and circumstances of unintentional
      drug-related deaths occurring in the county of Cambridgeshire, with the objective
      of identifying the prevalence of physical, mental, and social health problems
      within this cohort.Methods: We collected data on the demographics and mental and 
      physical health of, and drugs contributing to, 30 consecutive unintentional
      drug-related deaths recorded by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough County
      Council Coroners in 2017. A retrospective observational study was used, and data 
      were collected by manual extraction from coroners’ files.Results: Social
      isolation was identified as a recurring theme amongst the decedents, although
      homelessness was found in very few cases. Pharmacologically, multiple drug
      toxicity and opioid toxicity were highly prevalent, whilst prescription opioids
      were implicated in more cases than heroin. Chronic pain was also highly prevalent
      amongst the decedents, and a history of mental illness was found to occur in the 
      majority of cases.Discussion: Our findings show that reports from the coronial
      system provide a rich narrative to understand the causes of drug-related deaths. 
      We have identified that individuals who die from drug-related deaths frequently
      have multiple adverse physical, mental, and social problems. This implies that
      any attempt to reduce drug-related deaths requires a multi-faceted and
      multi-disciplinary approach.

TI  - Objective Pain Assessment: a Key for the Management of Chronic Pain.
LID - F1000 Faculty Rev-35
AB  - The individual and social burdens associated with chronic pain have been
      escalating globally. Accurate pain measurement facilitates early diagnosis,
      disease progression monitoring and therapeutic efficacy evaluation, thus is a key
      for the management of chronic pain. Although the “golden standards” of pain
      measurement are self-reported scales in clinical practice, the reliability of
      these subjective methods could be easily affected by patients’ physiological and 
      psychological status, as well as the assessors’ predispositions. Therefore,
      objective pain assessment has attracted substantial attention recently. Previous 
      studies of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed that certain
      cortices and subcortical areas are commonly activated in subjects suffering from 
      pain. Dynamic pain connectome analysis also found various alterations of neural
      network connectivity that are correlated with the severity of clinical pain
      symptoms. Electroencephalograph (EEG) demonstrated suppressed spontaneous
      oscillations during pain experience. Spectral power and coherence analysis of EEG
      also identified signatures of different types of chronic pain. Furthermore, fMRI 
      and EEG can visualize objective brain activities modulated by analgesics in a
      mechanism-based way, thus bridge the gaps between animal studies and clinical
      trials. Using fMRI and EEG, researchers are able to predict therapeutic efficacy 
      and identify personalized optimal first-line regimens. In the future, the
      emergence of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and cell labelling in MRI would
      encourage the investigation on metabolic and cellular pain biomarkers. The
      incorporation of machine learning algorithms with neuroimaging or behavior
      analysis could further enhance the specificity and accuracy of objective pain
      assessments.

TI  - A methodological quality assessment of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
      antidepressants effect on low back pain using updated AMSTAR.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: Antidepressants are prescribed widely to manage low back pain. There 
      are a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses which have investigated the 
      efficacy of the treatments, while the methodological quality of them has not been
      assessed yet. This study aims to evaluate the methodological quality of the
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigating the effect of antidepressants 
      on low back pain. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE,
      Medline, and Cochrane Library databases up to November 2018. The 16-item
      Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR2) scale was used to assess the 
      methodological quality of the studies. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
      the Antidepressants treatment effects on low back pain published in English
      language were included. There was no limitation on the type of Antidepressants
      drugs, clinical setting, and study population, while non-systematical reviews and
      qualitative and narrative reviews were excluded. Results: A total of 25
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses were evaluated; the studies were reported
      between 1992 and 2017. Obtained results from AMSTAR2 showed that 11 (44%), 9
      (36%) and 5 (20%) of the included studies had high, moderate and low qualities,
      respectively. 13(52%) of studies assessed risk of bias and 2(20%) of meta
      analyses considered publication bias. Also, 16 (64%) of the included reviews
      provided a satisfactory explanation for any heterogeneity observed in the
      results. Conclusions: Although the trend of publishing high quality papers in ADs
      effect on LBP increased recently, performing more high-quality SRs and MAs in
      this field with precise subgroups of the type of pains, the class of drugs and
      their dosages may give clear and more reliable evidence to help clinicians and
      policymakers.

TI  - Heterogeneity in the distribution of 159 drug-response related SNPs in world
      populations and their genetic relatedness.
LID - e0228000
AB  - Interethnic variability in drug response arises from genetic differences
      associated with drug metabolism, action and transport. These genetic variations
      can affect drug efficacy as well as cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We
      retrieved drug-response related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated
      data from databases and analyzed to elucidate population specific distribution of
      159 drug-response related SNPs in twenty six populations belonging to five
      super-populations (African, Admixed Americans, East Asian, European and South
      Asian). Significant interpopulation differences exist in the minor (variant)
      allele frequencies (MAFs), linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype
      distributions among these populations. 65 of the drug-response related alleles,
      which are considered as minor (variant) in global population, are present as the 
      major alleles (frequency ≥0.5) in at least one or more populations. Populations
      that belong to the same super-population have similar distribution pattern for
      majority of the variant alleles. These drug response related variant allele
      frequencies and their pairwise LD measure (r2) can clearly distinguish the
      populations in a way that correspond to the known evolutionary history of human
      and current geographic distributions, while D' cannot. The data presented here
      may aid in identifying drugs that are more appropriate and/or require
      pharmacogenetic testing in these populations. Our findings emphasize on the
      importance of distinct, ethnicity-specific clinical guidelines, especially for
      the African populations, to avoid ADRs and ensure effective drug treatment.

TI  - Persisting Reductions in Cannabis, Opioid, and Stimulant Misuse After
      Naturalistic Psychedelic Use: An Online Survey.
LID - 955
AB  - Background: Observational data and preliminary studies suggest serotonin 2A
      agonist psychedelics may hold potential in treating a variety of substance use
      disorders (SUDs), including opioid use disorder (OUD). Aims: The study aim was to
      describe and analyze self-reported cases in which naturalistic psychedelic use
      was followed by cessation or reduction in other substance use. Methods: An
      anonymous online survey of individuals reporting cessation or reduction in
      cannabis, opioid, or stimulant use following psychedelic use in non-clinical
      settings. Results: Four hundred forty-four respondents, mostly in the USA (67%)
      completed the survey. Participants reported 4.5 years of problematic substance
      use on average before the psychedelic experience to which they attributed a
      reduction in drug consumption, with 79% meeting retrospective criteria for severe
      SUD. Most reported taking a moderate or high dose of LSD (43%) or
      psilocybin-containing mushrooms (29%), followed by significant reduction in drug 
      consumption. Before the psychedelic experience 96% met SUD criteria, whereas only
      27% met SUD criteria afterward. Participants rated their psychedelic experience
      as highly meaningful and insightful, with 28% endorsing psychedelic-associated
      changes in life priorities or values as facilitating reduced substance misuse.
      Greater psychedelic dose, insight, mystical-type effects, and personal meaning of
      experiences were associated with greater reduction in drug consumption.
      Conclusions: While these cross-sectional and self-report methods cannot determine
      whether psychedelics caused changes in drug use, results suggest the potential
      that psychedelics cause reductions in problematic substance use, and support
      additional clinical research on psychedelic-assisted treatment for SUD.

TI  - Therapeutic Use of LSD in Psychiatry: A Systematic Review of
      Randomized-Controlled Clinical Trials.
LID - 943
AB  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was studied from the 1950s to the 1970s to
      evaluate behavioral and personality changes, as well as remission of psychiatric 
      symptoms in various disorders. LSD was used in the treatment of anxiety,
      depression, psychosomatic diseases and addiction. However, most of the studies
      were not performed under contemporary standards, and it has taken several decades
      for a resurgence of interest in LSD research and its therapeutic potential for
      psychiatry. The aim of this review is to identify controlled and randomized
      clinical trials that assess the potential use of LSD in psychiatry. PRISMA
      guidelines for systematic review were followed. A literature search of PubMed and
      Psychedelic bibliography from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic
      Studies (MAPS) databases was performed as well as a manual search of references
      from evaluated studies. Only randomized-controlled clinical trials were included.
      Study quality was systematically calculated by using the Cochrane Collaboration
      Tool for assessing risk of bias. A final selection of 11 articles was made after 
      considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. LSD was administered to 567
      patients in a dose ranging from 20 to 800 mcg. Despite the design heterogeneity
      of clinical trials, positive results were observed, thus revealing the
      therapeutic potential of LSD to reduce psychiatric symptomatology, mainly in
      alcoholism. The vast majority of authors describe significant and positive
      short-term changes in patients, despite the fact that in some studies an
      important homogenization was observed between the LSD treatment group and control
      group at long-term follow-up. Multiple variables regarding LSD treatment
      therapeutic approach and quality of experience were revealed and related to
      therapeutic outcomes. LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in
      psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment
      of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing proper double blind clinical
      trials with this substance, new studies that conform to modern standards are
      necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge on its use and open new doors in
      the future.

TI  - Epidemiology of knee osteoarthritis in general practice: a registry-based study.
LID - e031734
AB  - Objectives: The present study investigated (1) trends in the prevalence and
      incidence of knee osteoarthritis over a 20-year period (1996–2015); (2) trends in
      multimorbidity and (3) trends in drug prescriptions. Design: Registry-based
      study. Setting: Primary healthcare, Flanders, Belgium. Participants: Data were
      collected from Intego, a general practice-based morbidity registration network.
      In the study period between 1996 and 2015, data from 440 140 unique patients were
      available. Outcome measures: Trends in prevalence and incidence rate of knee
      osteoarthritis were computed using joinpoint regression analysis. The mean
      disease count was calculated to assess trends in multimorbidity. In addition, the
      number of drug prescriptions was identified by the Anatomical Therapeutic
      Chemical Classification code and trends were equally recorded with joinpoint
      regression. Results: The total age-standardised prevalence of knee osteoarthritis
      increased from 2.0% in 1996 to 3.6% in 2015. An upward trend was observed with an
      average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 2.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 2.9). In 2015, the 
      prevalence rates in the 10 year age groups from the 45–54 years age group onwards
      were 3.1%, 5.6%, 9.0% and 13.9%, to reach 15.0% in people aged 85 years and
      older. The incidence remained stable with 3.75‰ in 2015 (AAPC=−0.5, 95% CI −1.4
      to 0.5). The mean disease count significantly increased from 1.63 to 2.34
      (p<0.001) for incident cases with knee osteoarthritis. Finally, we observed a
      significantly positive trend in the overall prescription of acetaminophen
      (AAPC=6.7, 95% CI 5.6 to 7.7), weak opioids (AAPC=4.0, 95% CI 0.9 to 7.3) and
      glucosamine (AAPC=8.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 15.1). Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs were most prescribed, with a prevalence rate of 29.8% in 2015, but remained
      stable during the study period (AAPC=0.0, 95% CI −1.1 to 1.1). Conclusions:
      Increased prevalence, multimorbidity, and number of drug prescriptions confirm an
      increased burden of knee osteoarthritis. In future, these trends can be used to
      prioritise initiatives for improvement in care.

TI  - New drugs are not enough-drug repositioning in oncology: An update.
PG  - 651-84
AB  - Drug repositioning refers to the concept of discovering novel clinical benefits
      of drugs that are already known for use treating other diseases. The advantages
      of this are that several important drug characteristics are already established
      (including efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity), making the
      process of research for a putative drug quicker and less costly. Drug
      repositioning in oncology has received extensive focus. The present review
      summarizes the most prominent examples of drug repositioning for the treatment of
      cancer, taking into consideration their primary use, proposed anticancer
      mechanisms and current development status.

TI  - Relationship Between Pain Reduction and Improvement in Health-Related Quality of 
      Life in Patients with Knee Pain Due to Osteoarthritis Receiving Duloxetine:
      Exploratory Post Hoc Analysis of a Japanese Phase 3 Randomized Study.
PG  - 181-91
AB  - Purpose: This post hoc analysis of a Japanese phase 3 randomized study
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02248480) investigated relationships between
      changes in pain severity and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in
      duloxetine-treated patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Patients and Methods: 
      Patients with knee OA and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average pain score ≥4
      received duloxetine 60 mg/day or placebo for 14 weeks. Spearman rank correlation 
      coefficients were calculated for change in pain severity, as assessed by the BPI,
      and change in HRQoL, as assessed by the items of the (i) 36-item Short-Form
      Health Survey (SF-36; a generic measure of HRQoL) and (ii) Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC; an OA-specific measure of
      HRQoL). Results: After 14 weeks of treatment, there was a significantly greater
      improvement (p<0.001) for duloxetine (n=177) vs placebo (n=176) in BPI average
      pain severity score and significantly greater improvements (p<0.01) for
      duloxetine vs placebo for 5 of the 8 SF-36 domains (including the Role-Physical, 
      Bodily Pain, and Physical Functioning domains) and all 24 individual WOMAC items.
      The correlation between BPI change from baseline and SF-36 item change from
      baseline was statistically significant (p<0.05) for 2 of the 8 SF-36 items
      (Bodily Pain, Physical Functioning) in duloxetine-treated patients. The
      correlation between BPI change from baseline and WOMAC item change from baseline 
      was statistically significant for 22 of the 24 WOMAC items in duloxetine-treated 
      patients. Conclusion: This post hoc analysis suggested that the pain reduction
      observed in duloxetine-treated patients with knee OA was associated with
      improvements in OA-specific aspects of HRQoL, ie, pain and physical functioning.

TI  - Risk factors for prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay among patients
      with acute drug overdose in Japan.
LID - e482
AB  - Aim: Hospital selection for patients with drug overdose (DOD) is a critical
      issue. In Tokyo, the 50‐tablet rule has been widely utilized by paramedics for
      triaging patients with DOD given that it shortens the triage time. However,
      studies have not investigated the utility of such a rule in local cities. The
      present study aimed to identify prognostic pre‐ and in‐hospital factors among
      patients with DOD and determine whether the 50‐tablet rule benefits local cities.
      Methods: Clinical records of patients with DOD admitted at the University of
      Tsukuba Hospital (Tsukuba, Japan) between 2013 and 2017 were retrospectively
      reviewed. Results: A total of 93 patients with DOD were enrolled in this study.
      Multivariate analysis showed that creatine kinase and C‐reactive protein values
      and the total number of ingested pills were in‐hospital risk factors that
      significantly prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay. Moreover,
      Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission and the total number of ingested pills were
      identified as significant pre‐hospital risk factors for prolonged ICU and
      hospital stay. Setting the total number of ingested pills to 50 tablets did not
      significantly influence ICU and hospital stay. Conclusion: The total number of
      ingested pills and creatine kinase and C‐reactive protein values were identified 
      as predictive factors for prolonged ICU and hospital stay in patients with DOD
      after admission. Moreover, pre‐hospital risk factors included Glasgow Coma Scale 
      score and the total number of ingested pills. However, the 50‐tablet rule was
      determined to be a poor cut‐off value for patients with DOD. We presented a
      subset of our findings at the 46th annual meeting of the Japanese Society for
      Acute Medicine (Yokohama, Japan) on 20 November 2018.

TI  - Re-prioritizing traffic stops to reduce motor vehicle crash outcomes and racial
      disparities.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: Law enforcement traffic stops are one of the most common entryways to
      the US justice system. Conventional frameworks suggest traffic stops promote
      public safety by reducing dangerous driving practices and non-vehicular crime.
      Law enforcement agencies have wide latitude in enforcement, including
      prioritization of stop types: (1) safety (e.g. moving violation) stops, (2)
      investigatory stops, or (3) economic (regulatory and equipment) stops. In order
      to prevent traffic crash fatalities and reduce racial disparities, the police
      department of Fayetteville, North Carolina significantly re-prioritized safety
      stops. Methods: Annual traffic stop, motor vehicle crash, and crime data from
      2002 to 2016 were combined to examine intervention (2013–2016) effects.
      Fayetteville was compared against synthetic control agencies built from 8 similar
      North Carolina agencies by weighted matching on pre-intervention period trends
      and comparison against post-intervention trends. Results: On average over the
      intervention period as compared to synthetic controls, Fayetteville increased
      both the number of safety stops + 121% (95% confidence interval + 17%, + 318%)
      and the relative proportion of safety stops (+ 47%). Traffic crash and injury
      outcomes were reduced, including traffic fatalities − 28% (− 64%, + 43%),
      injurious crashes − 23% (− 49%, + 16%), and total crashes − 13% (− 48%, + 21%).
      Disparity measures were reduced, including Black percent of traffic stops − 7%
      (− 9%, − 5%) and Black vs. White traffic stop rate ratio − 21% (− 29%, − 13%). In
      contrast to the Ferguson Effect hypothesis, the relative de-prioritization of
      investigatory stops was not associated with an increase in non-traffic crime
      outcomes, which were reduced or unchanged, including index crimes − 10% (− 25%,
      + 8%) and violent crimes − 2% (− 33%, + 43%). Confidence intervals were estimated
      using a different technique and, given small samples, may be asymmetrical.
      Conclusions: The re-prioritization of traffic stop types by law enforcement
      agencies may have positive public health consequences both for motor vehicle
      injury and racial disparity outcomes while having little impact on non-traffic
      crime.

TI  - The Role of CYP450 Drug Metabolism in Precision Cardio-Oncology.
LID - 604
AB  - As many novel cancer therapies continue to emerge, the field of Cardio-Oncology
      (or onco-cardiology) has become crucial to prevent, monitor and treat cancer
      therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity. Furthermore, given the narrow
      therapeutic window of most cancer therapies, drug-drug interactions are prevalent
      in the cancer population. Consequently, there is an increased risk of affecting
      drug efficacy or predisposing individual patients to adverse side effects. Here
      we review the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in the field of
      Cardio-Oncology. We highlight the importance of cardiac medications in preventive
      Cardio-Oncology for high-risk patients or in the management of cardiotoxicities
      during or following cancer treatment. Common interactions between Oncology and
      Cardiology drugs are catalogued, emphasizing the impact of differential
      metabolism of each substrate drug on unpredictable drug bioavailability and
      consequent inter-individual variability in treatment response or development of
      cardiovascular toxicity. This inter-individual variability in bioavailability and
      subsequent response can be further enhanced by genomic variants in CYP450, or by 
      modifications of CYP450 gene, RNA or protein expression or function in various
      ‘omics’ related to precision medicine. Thus, we advocate for an individualized
      approach to each patient by a multidisciplinary team with clinical pharmacists
      evaluating a treatment plan tailored to a practice of precision Cardio-Oncology. 
      This review may increase awareness of these key concepts in the rapidly evolving 
      field of Cardio-Oncology.

TI  - New Perspective in Diabetic Neuropathy: From the Periphery to the Brain, a Call
      for Early Detection, and Precision Medicine.
LID - 929
AB  - Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes
      mellitus. It leads to distressing and expensive clinical sequelae such as foot
      ulceration, leg amputation, and neuropathic pain (painful-DPN). Unfortunately,
      DPN is often diagnosed late when irreversible nerve injury has occurred and its
      first presentation may be with a diabetic foot ulcer. Several novel diagnostic
      techniques are available which may supplement clinical assessment and aid the
      early detection of DPN. Moreover, treatments for DPN and painful-DPN are limited.
      Only tight glucose control in type 1 diabetes has robust evidence in reducing the
      risk of developing DPN. However, neither glucose control nor pathogenetic
      treatments are effective in painful-DPN and symptomatic treatments are often
      inadequate. It has recently been hypothesized that using various patient
      characteristics it may be possible to stratify individuals and assign them
      targeted therapies to produce better pain relief. We review the diagnostic
      techniques which may aid the early detection of DPN in the clinical and research 
      environment, and recent advances in precision medicine techniques for the
      treatment of painful-DPN.

TI  - The Risks and Outcomes Resulting From Medication Errors Reported in the Finnish
      Tertiary Care Units:: A Cross-Sectional Retrospective Register Study.
LID - 1571
AB  - Background: Hospital-acquired medication errors (MEs) are common in health care. 
      Although voluntary reporting is criticized for not producing reliable estimates
      on ME frequency, it provides valuable knowledge on errors occurring in the
      medication process.Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze and
      determine the risks and outcomes resulting from MEs related to the TOP15
      medicines in the Finnish tertiary care units from July 2016 to July 2017.Methods:
      The data consisting of 1,447 ME reports was organized according to ATC
      classification, after which TOP15 medicines involved in the reports were
      selected. Inductive content analysis was performed to the reports. After this,
      the reports were categorized by ME outcome into five categories and further
      analyzed accordingly.Results: The most common ME outcome in the reports was
      “omitted medicine” (33.9%). More than a quarter (27.1%) of ME reports were
      estimated to cause moderate or severe risk to the patient. When compared with
      each other, none of the outcome groups were more susceptible to high-risk events 
      (p = 0.71). Of the TOP15 medicines, only Norepinephrine had significantly higher 
      risk of being involved in high-risk events (OR 2.43, 95%CI 1.35–4.61).Conclusion:
      Voluntary reporting has an important role in the development of medication safety
      and the overall medication process within organizations. Although majority of the
      TOP15 medicines were involved in MEs resulting in seemingly high-risk outcomes,
      they were estimated to be insignificant or minor within the reporting unit. In
      the future, more emphasis will be needed for the assessment and analysis of the
      reports for more efficient, real-time detection and response to signals from
      health care units.

TI  - Association Between Bullying and Suicidal Behavior Among Chinese Adolescents: An 
      Analysis of Gender Differences.
PG  - 89-96
AB  - Background: Suicide has become the leading cause of death among 15–34 years old
      in China, and more attention should be paid to risk factors and prevention of
      suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. The school-based survey was conducted to 
      test the associations of bullying behavior with suicidal ideation and suicide
      attempts, and to assess whether the biological gender can moderate these
      associations. Methods: A multistage stratified cluster sampling method was used
      to recruit participants from high schools in Guizhou, China, and univariate and
      multivariate logistic regression models were fitted. Results: A total of 23,392
      students were included in the analysis, and 45.4% were boys. The mean age of the 
      students was 15.2 (SD: 1.9) years. Overall, 3.8% (882) of the students were
      victims, 4.9% (1144) were bullies, and 3.2% (736) were bully-victims. A total of 
      18.9% of students reported having suicidal ideation, and 3.9% reported having
      suicide attempts. Victims (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.15, 95% CI=1.84–2.51),
      bullies (AOR=3.17, 95% CI=2.78–3.62), and bully-victims (AOR=3.18, 95%
      CI=2.71–3.73) were at an elevated risk of suicidal ideation than neutrals;
      similar associations can be found in the associations between bullying behavior
      and suicide attempts. Further stratification analyses showed that the
      associations of being bullied or bullying others with suicidal ideation and
      suicide attempts were slightly stronger in girls than in boys. Conclusion:
      Prevention or intervention programs are recommended to take the biological gender
      into consideration, and future studies are also warranted to investigate the
      reasons of differences by gender in the association of bullying and suicidal
      behavior.

TI  - Socioeconomic risk factors for fatal opioid overdoses in the United States:
      Findings from the Mortality Disparities in American Communities Study (MDAC).
LID - e0227966
AB  - Background: Understanding relationships between individual-level demographic,
      socioeconomic status (SES) and U.S. opioid fatalities can inform interventions in
      response to this crisis. Methods: The Mortality Disparities in American Community
      Study (MDAC) links nearly 4 million 2008 American Community Survey responses to
      the 2008–2015 National Death Index. Univariate and multivariable models were used
      to estimate opioid overdose fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). Results: Opioid overdose was an overrepresented cause of death
      among people 10 to 59 years of age. In multivariable analysis, compared to
      Hispanics, Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives had elevated risk (HR =
      2.52, CI:2.21–2.88) and (HR = 1.88, CI:1.35–2.62), respectively. Compared to
      women, men were at-risk (HR = 1.61, CI:1.50–1.72). People who were disabled were 
      at higher risk than those who were not (HR = 2.80, CI:2.59–3.03). Risk was higher
      among widowed than married (HR = 2.44, CI:2.03–2.95) and unemployed than employed
      individuals (HR = 2.46, CI:2.17–2.79). Compared to adults with graduate degrees, 
      those with high school only were at-risk (HR = 2.48, CI:2.00–3.06). Citizens were
      more likely than noncitizens to die from this cause (HR = 4.62, CI:3.48–6.14).
      Compared to people who owned homes with mortgages, those who rented had higher
      HRs (HR = 1.36, CI:1.25–1.48). Non-rural residents had higher risk than rural
      residents (HR = 1.46, CI:1.34, 1.59). Compared to respective referent groups,
      people without health insurance (HR = 1.30, CI:1.20–1.41) and people who were
      incarcerated were more likely to die from opioid overdoses (HR = 2.70,
      CI:1.91–3.81). Compared to people living in households at least five-times above 
      the poverty line, people who lived in poverty were more likely to die from this
      cause (HR = 1.36, CI:1.20–1.54). Compared to people living in West North Central 
      states, HRs were highest among those in South Atlantic (HR = 1.29, CI:1.11, 1.50)
      and Mountain states (HR = 1.58, CI:1.33, 1.88). Discussion: Opioid fatality was
      associated with indicators of low SES. The findings may help to target
      prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts to vulnerable groups.

      Rats.
LID - 149
AB  - Acute hypertension produced by methamphetamine (MA) is well known, mainly by the 
      enhancement of catecholamine release from sympathetic terminals. However, the
      central pressor mechanism of the blood-brain-barrier-penetrating molecule remains
      unclear. We used radio-telemetry and femoral artery cannulation to monitor the
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) in conscious free-moving and urethane-anesthetized
      rats, respectively. Expression of Fos protein (Fos) and phosphorylation of
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit GluN1 in the rostral ventrolateral medulla 
      (RVLM) were detected using Western blot analysis. ELISA was carried out for
      detection of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the RVLM. MA-induced glutamate
      release in the RVLM was assayed using in vivo microdialysis and HPLC. Systemic or
      intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of MA augments the MAP and
      increases Fos expression, PKC activity, and phosphorylated GluN1-ser 896
      (pGluN1-ser 896) in the RVLM. However, direct microinjection of MA into the RVLM 
      did not change the MAP. Unilateral microinjection of a PKC inhibitor or a
      metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonist into the RVLM
      dose-dependently attenuated the i.c.v. MA-induced increase in MAP and pGluN1-ser 
      896. Our data suggested that MA may give rise to glutamate release in the RVLM
      further to the activation of mGluR5-PKC pathways, which would serve as a central 
      mechanism for the MA-induced pressor effect.

TI  - Fluoroscopy-Guided Percutaneous Sacroplasty for Painful Metastases at the Sacral 
      Ala.
PG  - 151-6
AB  - Objective: Percutaneous sacroplasty (PSP) is widely used in the clinic for
      osteoporotic sacral insufficiency fractures; however, few reports have described 
      the safety and effectiveness of PSP for painful sacral metastases at the sacral
      ala under fluoroscopy alone. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      fluoroscopy-guided PSP for painful metastases at the sacral ala. Patients and
      Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients (median age, 60.74 ± 12.74 years), with
      a total of 41 metastatic lesions at the sacral ala, were treated with PSP. The
      patients were followed up for periods ranging from 1 month to 30 months (average,
      8.23 ± 6.75 months). The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index
      (ODI), and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) were used to evaluate pain,
      mobility, and quality of life before the procedure and at 3 days and 1, 3, 6, 12,
      and 18 months after the procedure. Results: Technical success was achieved in all
      patients. The minimum follow-up duration was 1 month. The mean VAS scores
      declined significantly from 7.20 ± 0.93 before the procedure to 3.43 ± 1.38 by
      day 3 after the procedure, and was 3.13 ± 1.07 at 1 month, 3.17 ± 1.15 at 3
      months, 2.91± 1.38 at 6 months, and 2.57 ± 1.51 at 12 months after the procedure 
      (P < 0.001). After PSP, analgesic drug administration had been discontinued in 31
      of 35 patients (88.57%). The ODI and KPS also changed after PSP, with significant
      differences between the baseline scores and those at each follow-up examination
      (P < 0.001). Extraosseous cement leakage occurred in 12 cases without any major
      clinical complications. Conclusion: PSP is a safe and effective technique for the
      palliative treatment of painful metastases involving the sacral ala under
      fluoroscopic guidance alone. It can relieve pain, reduce disability, and improve 
      function, and is associated with minimal complications.

TI  - Incidence of Opioid Overdose Among Patients Using ER/LA Opioid Analgesics Before 
      and After Implementation of the Class-Wide Opioid Risk Evaluation and Mitigation 
      Strategy.
PG  - 157-69
AB  - Introduction: The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required 
      a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and
      long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics on 09 July 2012. Methods: This study
      compared the incidence of opioid overdose before (July 2010-June 2012) and after 
      (July 2013-September 2016) the initiation of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
      Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics.
      We identified patients with ≥1 ER/LA opioid dispensing in either time period in
      national data from the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and in
      United States (US) Medicaid claims data from four states. We described each
      population, calculated the incidence rate (IR) of opioid overdose, and assessed
      crude and propensity score adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing the
      overdose rate after vs before implementation of the REMS. Results: A total of
      121,229 commercially insured and 11,488 Medicaid patients were included in the
      analysis. Rates of overdose were substantially higher in Medicaid patients than
      in the commercially insured patients (IR 192.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      162.60–225.18 versus 102.60, 95% CI 93.0–112.93 in the active period). The IRRs
      for opioid overdose were 1.01 (95% CI 0.87–1.17) in the commercially insured
      population and 0.70 (95% CI 0.52–0.93) in Medicaid. Conclusion: This leveling off
      of overdose rates among commercially insured patients and decline among Medicaid 
      patients is encouraging, but it is difficult to disentangle the specific impact
      of the REMS from many other ongoing initiatives with similar goals.

TI  - Chronotherapy of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs May Enhance Postoperative 
      Recovery.
LID - 468
AB  - Postoperative pain relief is crucial for full recovery. With the ongoing opioid
      epidemic and the insufficient effect of acetaminophen on severe pain;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are heavily used to alleviate this
      pain. However, NSAIDs are known to inhibit postoperative healing of connective
      tissues by inhibiting prostaglandin signaling. Pain intensity, inflammatory
      mediators associated with wound healing and the pharmacological action of NSAIDs 
      vary throughout the day due to the circadian rhythm regulated by the clock genes.
      According to this rhythm, most of wound healing mediators and connective tissue
      formation occurs during the resting phase, while pain, inflammation and tissue
      resorption occur during the active period of the day. Here we show, in a murine
      tibia fracture surgical model, that NSAIDs are most effective in managing
      postoperative pain, healing and recovery when drug administration is limited to
      the active phase of the circadian rhythm. Limiting NSAID treatment to the active 
      phase of the circadian rhythm resulted in overexpression of circadian clock
      genes, such as Period 2 (Per2) at the healing callus, and increased serum levels 
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-13 (IL-13), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and
      vascular endothelial growth factor. By contrast, NSAID administration during the 
      resting phase resulted in severe bone healing impairment.

TI  - The effectiveness of substance use interventions for homeless and vulnerably
      housed persons:  A systematic review of systematic reviews on supervised
      consumption facilities, managed alcohol programs, and pharmacological agents for 
      opioid use disorder.
LID - e0227298
AB  - Background: Substance use is disproportionately high among people who are
      homeless or vulnerably housed. We performed a systematic overview of reviews
      examining the effects of selected harm reduction and pharmacological
      interventions on the health and social well-being of people who use substances,
      with a focus on homeless populations. Methods and findings: We searched MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, PsycINFO, Joanna Briggs Institute EBP, Cochrane Database of Systematic
      Reviews and DARE for systematic reviews from inception to August 2019. We
      conducted a grey literature search and hand searched reference lists. We selected
      reviews that synthesized evidence on supervised consumption facilities, managed
      alcohol programs and pharmacological interventions for opioid use disorders. We
      abstracted data specific to homeless or vulnerably housed populations. We
      assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Our search identified
      483 citations and 30 systematic reviews met all inclusion criteria, capturing the
      results from 442 primary studies. This included three reviews on supervised
      consumption facilities, 24 on pharmacological interventions, and three on managed
      alcohol programs. Supervised consumption facilities decreased lethal overdoses
      and other high risk behaviours without any significant harm, and improved access 
      to care. Pharmaceutical interventions reduced mortality, morbidity, and substance
      use, but the impact on retention in treatment, mental illness and access to care 
      was variable. Managed alcohol programs reduced or stabilized alcohol consumption.
      Few studies on managed alcohol programs reported deaths. Conclusions: Substance
      use is a common chronic condition impacting homeless populations. Supervised
      consumption facilities reduce overdose and improve access to care, while
      pharmacological interventions may play a role in reducing harms and addressing
      other morbidity. High quality evidence on managed alcohol programs is limited.

TI  - Toxicology studies of aqueous-alcohol extracts of Harpagophytum procumbens subsp.
      procumbens (Burch.) DC.Ex Meisn. (Pedaliaceae) in female and male rats.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: A variety of medicinal products prepared from secondary tubers of
      Harpagophytum procumbens subsp. procumbens (Burch.) DC.ex Meisn. (Devil’s Claw)
      and H. zeyheri are marketed in Africa, Europe, the United States, South America
      and elsewhere, where they are used for inflammatory and musculoskeletal
      conditions such as arthritis, lower back pain, rheumatism and neuralgia, etc.
      While clinical studies conducted over the last twenty years support the general
      safety of such products, infrequent gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhea,
      nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), headache, vertigo and hypersensitivity
      (allergic) reactions (rash, hives and face swelling) have been documented.
      Sex-related differences occur in the health conditions for which Devil’s Claw
      products are used, so it is likely that usage is similarly sex-related and so
      might be side effects and potential toxicities. However toxicologic studies of
      Devil’s Claw products have been conducted primarily with male animals. To address
      this deficit, we report toxicological studies in female and male rats of several 
      H. procumbens (HP) aqueous-alcohol extracts chemically analyzed by UPLC-MS.
      Methods: Female and male Sprague Dawley rats were studied for one and three
      months in groups differing by consumption of diets without and with HP extracts
      at a 7–10-fold human equivalent dose (HED). Sera were analyzed for blood
      chemistry, and heart, liver, lung, kidney, stomach, and small and large intestine
      tissues were examined for histopathology. Treatment group differences for blood
      chemistry were analyzed by ANOVA with Dunnett’s test and significant group
      differences for endpoints with marginal distributional properties were verified
      using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Group differences for histopathology were tested
      using Chi Square analysis. Results: Significant group by sex-related differences 
      in blood chemistry were detected in both studies. Additionally, several
      sex-related differences occurred between the studies. However, significant
      histopathology effects associated with the consumption of the extracts were not
      detected. Conclusion: Toxicologic analysis of Devil’s Claw extracts cause
      significant sex-related effects in blood chemistry. However, in our judgement,
      none of the observed effects suggest serious toxicity at these doses and
      durations. Subsequent toxicologic and clinical studies of H. procumbens and other
      medicines with similar properties should explore in greater detail the basis and 
      consequences of potential sex-related effects.

TI  - Therapeutic use of cannabis and cannabinoids: an evidence mapping and appraisal
      of systematic reviews.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: Although cannabis and cannabinoids are widely used with therapeutic
      purposes, their claimed efficacy is highly controversial. For this reason,
      medical cannabis use is a broad field of research that is rapidly expanding. Our 
      objectives are to identify, characterize, appraise, and organize the current
      available evidence surrounding therapeutic use of cannabis and cannabinoids,
      using evidence maps. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library
      and CINAHL, to identify systematic reviews (SRs) published from their inception
      up to December 2017. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data
      independently. We assessed methodological quality of the included SRs using the
      AMSTAR tool. To illustrate the extent of use of medical cannabis, we organized
      the results according to identified PICO questions using bubble plots
      corresponding to different clinical scenarios. Results: A total of 44 SRs
      published between 2001 and 2017 were included in this evidence mapping with data 
      from 158 individual studies. We extracted 96 PICO questions in the following
      medical conditions: multiple sclerosis, movement disorders (e.g. Tourette
      Syndrome, Parkinson Disease), psychiatry conditions, Alzheimer disease, epilepsy,
      acute and chronic pain, cancer, neuropathic pain, symptoms related to cancer
      (e.g. emesis and anorexia related with chemotherapy), rheumatic disorders,
      HIV-related symptoms, glaucoma, and COPD. The evidence about these conditions is 
      heterogeneous regarding the conclusions and the quality of the individual primary
      studies. The quality of the SRs was moderate to high according to AMSTAR scores. 
      Conclusions: Evidence on medical uses of cannabis is broad. However, due to
      methodological limitations, conclusions were weak in most of the assessed
      comparisons. Evidence mapping methodology is useful to perform an overview of
      available research, since it is possible to systematically describe the extent
      and distribution of evidence, and to organize scattered data.

TI  - Chronic Non-Malignant Pain in Patients with Cancer Seen at a Timely Outpatient
      Palliative Care Clinic.
LID - 214
AB  - Palliative care is seeing cancer patients earlier in the disease trajectory with 
      a multitude of chronic issues. Chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) in cancer
      patients is under-studied. In this prospective study, we examined the prevalence 
      and management of CNMP in cancer patients seen at our supportive care clinic for 
      consultation. We systematically characterized each pain type with the Brief Pain 
      Inventory (BPI) and documented current treatments. The attending physician made
      the pain diagnoses according to the International Association for the Study of
      Pain (IASP) task force classification. Among 200 patients (mean age 60 years, 69%
      metastatic disease, 1-year survival of 77%), the median number of pain diagnosis 
      was 2 (IQR 1–2); 67 (34%, 95% CI 28–41%) had a diagnosis of CNMP; 133 (67%) had
      cancer-related pain; and 52 (26%) had treatment-related pain. In total, 12/31
      (39%) patients with only CNMP and 21/36 (58%) patients with CNMP and other pain
      diagnoses were on opioids. There was a total of 94 CNMP diagnoses among 67
      patients, including 37 (39%) osteoarthritis and 20 (21%) lower back pain; 30
      (32%) were treated with opioids. In summary, CNMP was common in the timely
      palliative care setting and many patients were on opioids. Our findings highlight
      the need to develop clinical guidelines for CNMP in cancer patients to
      standardize its management.

TI  - Is it really always only the others who are to blame? GP’s view on medical
      overuse. A questionnaire study.
LID - e0227457
AB  - Background: Medical overuse is a common problem in health care. Preventing
      unnecessary medicine is one of the main tasks of General Practice, so called
      quaternary prevention. We aimed to capture the current opinion of German General 
      Practitioners (GPs) to medical overuse. Methods: A quantitative online study was 
      conducted. The questionnaire was developed based on a qualitative study and
      literature search. GPs were asked to estimate prevalence of medical overuse as
      well as to evaluate drivers and solutions of medical overuse. GPs in Bavaria were
      recruited via email (750 addresses). A descriptive data analysis was performed.
      Additionally the association between doctors’ attitudes and (1) demographic
      variables and (2) interest in campaigns against medical overuse was assessed.
      Results: Response rate was 18%. The mean age was 54 years, 79% were male and 68% 
      have worked as GP longer than 15 years. Around 38% of medical services were
      considered as medical overuse and nearly half of the GPs (47%) judged medical
      overuse to be the more important problem than medical underuse. Main drivers were
      seen in “patients´ expectations” (76%), “lack of a primary care system” (61%) and
      “defensive medicine” (53%), whereas “disregard of evidence/guidelines” (15%) and 
      “economic pressure on the side of the doctor” (13%) were not weighted as
      important causes. Demographic variables did not have an important impact on GPs´ 
      response pattern. GPs interested in campaigns like “Choosing Wisely” showed a
      higher awareness for medical overuse, although these campaigns were only known by
      50% of the respondents. Discussion: Medical overuse is an important issue for
      GPs. Main drivers were searched and found outside their own sphere of
      responsibility. Campaigns as “Choosing Wisely” seem to have a positive effect on 
      GPs attitude, but knowledge is still limited.

TI  - High-frequency spinal cord stimulation at 10 kHz for the treatment of painful
      diabetic neuropathy: design of a multicenter, randomized controlled trial
      (SENZA-PDN).
LID - 87
AB  - Background: Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), a debilitating and progressive
      chronic pain condition that significantly impacts quality of life, is one of the 
      common complications seen with long-standing diabetes mellitus. Neither
      pharmacological treatments nor low-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has
      provided significant and long-term pain relief for patients with PDN. This study 
      aims to document the value of 10-kHz SCS in addition to conventional medical
      management (CMM) compared with CMM alone in patients with refractory PDN.
      Methods: In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (SENZA-PDN), 
      216 subjects with PDN will be assigned 1:1 to receive 10-kHz SCS combined with
      CMM or CMM alone after appropriate institutional review board approvals and
      followed for 24 months. Key inclusion criteria include (1) symptoms of PDN for at
      least 12 months, (2) average pain intensity of at least 5 cm—on a 0- to 10-cm
      visual analog scale (VAS)—in the lower limbs, and (3) an appropriate candidate
      for SCS. Key exclusion criteria include (1) large or gangrenous ulcers or (2)
      average pain intensity of at least 3 cm on VAS in the upper limbs or both. Along 
      with pain VAS, neurological assessments, health-related quality of life, sleep
      quality, and patient satisfaction will be captured. The primary endpoint
      comparing responder rates (≥50% pain relief) and safety rates between the
      treatment groups will be assessed at 3 months. Several secondary endpoints will
      also be reported on. Discussion: Enrollment commenced in 2017 and was completed
      in 2019. This study will help to determine whether 10-kHz SCS improves clinical
      outcomes and health-related quality of life and is a cost-effective treatment for
      PDN that is refractory to CMM. Trial registration: ClincalTrials.gov identifier: 
      NCT03228420 (registered 24 July 2017).

TI  - Hepatitis C Virus Prevalence in 50 U.S. States and D.C. by Sex, Birth Cohort, and
      Race: 2013‐2016.
PG  - 355-70
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver‐related morbidity
      and mortality, and more than 2 million adults in the United States are estimated 
      to be currently infected. Reducing HCV burden will require an understanding of
      demographic disparities and targeted efforts to reduce prevalence in populations 
      with disproportionate disease rates. We modeled state‐level estimates of
      hepatitis C prevalence among U.S. adults by sex, birth cohort, and race during
      2013‐2016. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data were used in
      combination with state‐level HCV‐related and narcotic overdose–related mortality 
      data from the National Vital Statistics System and estimates from external
      literature review on populations not sampled in the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey. Nationally, estimated hepatitis C prevalence was 1.3% among
      males and 0.6% among females (prevalence ratio [PR] = 2.3). Among persons born
      during 1945 to 1969, prevalence was 1.6% compared with 0.5% among persons born
      after 1969 (PR = 3.2). Among persons born during 1945 to 1969, prevalence ranged 
      from 0.7% in North Dakota to 3.6% in Oklahoma and 6.8% in the District of
      Columbia. Among persons born after 1969, prevalence was more than twice as high
      in Kentucky, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and West Virginia compared with the national
      average. Hepatitis C prevalence was 1.8% among non‐Hispanic black persons and
      0.8% among persons of other races (PR = 2.2), and the magnitude of this disparity
      varied widely across jurisdictions (PR range: 1.3‐7.8). Overall, 23% of prevalent
      HCV infections occurred among non‐Hispanic black persons, whereas 12% of the
      population was represented by this racial group. These estimates provide
      information on prevalent HCV infections that jurisdictions can use for
      understanding and monitoring local disease patterns and racial disparities in
      burden of disease.

TI  - Use of analgesics in acute stroke patients with inability to self-report pain: a 
      retrospective cohort study.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Pain is a common and burdensome complication in patients with acute
      stroke. We assessed the impact of impaired communication in stroke patients on
      pain assessment and treatment. Methods: We included 909 (507 male, mean age
      71.8 years) patients admitted to our stroke unit from 01/2015 to 12/2015 in the
      analysis. Patients were assigned to four groups: able to communicate (AC), not
      able to communicate prior to index stroke (P-NAC), due to focal symptoms of index
      stroke (S-NAC), due to a reduced level of consciousness (C-NAC). Pain prevalence,
      documentation of pain and use of analgesics were evaluated. C-NAC patients were
      excluded from analyses regarding analgesic treatment due to relevant differences 
      in patient characteristics. Results: 746 patients (82.1%) were classified as AC, 
      25 (2.8%) as P-NAC, 90 (9.9%) as S-NAC and 48 (5.3%) as C-NAC. Pain was
      documented on the Numeric Rating Scale and in form of free text by nurses and
      physicians. Nurses documented pain more frequently than physicians (p < 0.001).
      Pain prevalence was 47.0% (n.s. between groups). The use of analgesic medication 
      increased from 48.7% in the AC group, to 76.0% in the P-NAC group, and 77.8% in
      the S-NAC group (p < 0.001). Opioid use was significantly more frequent in NAC
      patients (p < 0.001). The response to the treatment was poorly documented with
      significantly lowest rates in S-NAC patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study 
      suggests that post-stroke pain in patients with inability to communicate is not
      attended enough, not systematically assessed and therefore not sufficiently
      treated.

TI  - The Value Proposition for Pathologists: A Population Health Approach.
LID - 2374289519898857
AB  - The transition to a value-based payment system offers pathologists the
      opportunity to play an increased role in population health by improving outcomes 
      and safety as well as reducing costs. Although laboratory testing itself accounts
      for a small portion of health-care spending, laboratory data have significant
      downstream effects in patient management as well as diagnosis. Pathologists
      currently are heavily engaged in precision medicine, use of laboratory and
      pathology test results (including autopsy data) to reduce diagnostic errors, and 
      play leading roles in diagnostic management teams. Additionally, pathologists can
      use aggregate laboratory data to monitor the health of populations and improve
      health-care outcomes for both individual patients and populations. For the
      profession to thrive, pathologists will need to focus on extending their roles
      outside the laboratory beyond the traditional role in the analytic phase of
      testing. This should include leadership in ensuring correct ordering and
      interpretation of laboratory testing and leadership in population health
      programs. Pathologists in training will need to learn key concepts in informatics
      and data analytics, health-care economics, public health, implementation science,
      and health systems science. While these changes may reduce reimbursement for the 
      traditional activities of pathologists, new opportunities arise for value
      creation and new compensation models. This report reviews these opportunities for
      pathologist leadership in utilization management, precision medicine, reducing
      diagnostic errors, and improving health-care outcomes.

TI  - Design of a randomized controlled trial to Link Infectious and Narcology Care
      (LINC-II) in St. Petersburg, Russia.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: If Russia is to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 HIV targets, better
      approaches to engage, effectively treat, and retain patients in care are needed. 
      This paper describes the protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing 
      the effectiveness of LINC-II, a strength-based case management program for
      HIV-positive people who inject drugs (PWID) to increase rates of HIV viral
      suppression, ART initiation, and opioid abstinence. Methods: This RCT will enroll
      and randomize 240 participants, recruited from a narcology (addiction care)
      hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. Participants are randomized to the
      intervention or control arms. Those in the intervention arm receive: (1)
      strengths-based HIV case management supporting coordinated care; (2) rapid ART
      initiation; and (3) pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder. We will evaluate the
      intervention’s effectiveness compared to standard of care on the following
      outcomes: (1) undetectable HIV viral load at 12 months (primary); (2) initiation 
      of ART within 28 days of randomization; (3) change in CD4 count from baseline to 
      12 months; (4) retention in HIV care (i.e., ≥ 1 visit to medical care in 2
      consecutive 6 month periods); (5) undetectable HIV viral load at 6 months; and
      (6) past 30-day opioid abstinence (at 6 and at 12 months). Discussion: This RCT
      will assess the LINC-II intervention in an urban Russian setting. If effective,
      it will offer a new approach for increasing the uptake of both HIV and opioid use
      disorder treatment and coordination of these modalities in standard Eastern
      European clinical settings.Trial registration This study was registered with

TI  - The nephrologist's guide to cannabis and cannabinoids.
PG  - 248-57
AB  - Purpose of review: Cannabis (marijuana, weed, pot, ganja, Mary Jane) is the most 
      commonly used federally illicit drug in the United States. The present review
      provides an overview of cannabis and cannabinoids with relevance to the practice 
      of nephrology so that clinicians can best take care of patients. Recent findings:
      Cannabis may have medicinal benefits for treating symptoms of advanced chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease including as a pain adjuvant
      potentially reducing the need for opioids. Cannabis does not seem to affect
      kidney function in healthy individuals. However, renal function should be closely
      monitored in those with CKD, the lowest effective dose should be used, and
      smoking should be avoided. Cannabis use may delay transplant candidate listing or
      contribute to ineligibility. Cannabidiol (CBD) has recently exploded in
      popularity. Although generally well tolerated, safe without significant side
      effects, and effective for a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, 
      consumers have easy access to a wide range of unregulated CBD products, some with
      inaccurate labeling and false health claims. Importantly, CBD may raise
      tacrolimus levels. Summary: Patients and healthcare professionals have little
      guidance or evidence regarding the impact of cannabis use on people with kidney
      disease. This knowledge gap will remain as long as federal regulations remain
      prohibitively restrictive towards prospective research.

TI  - Stimulant safe supply: a potential opportunity to respond to the overdose
      epidemic.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: Occurring against the backdrop of an overdose crisis, stimulant use
      and stimulant-involved deaths in North America are increasing at an alarming
      rate. Many of these deaths are being attributed to fentanyl and related analogs, 
      which have been increasingly found within street-level stimulant supplies. Within
      this, people experiencing socio-economic marginalization are at the greatest risk
      of overdose and other harms from adulterated stimulants. Current treatments for
      stimulant use disorder have limited effectiveness, and even less applicability to
      the lived realities of marginalized stimulant users. Emerging technologies, such 
      as drug checking, are being implemented to support safer stimulant use, but the
      accessibility and utility of these technologies to stimulant users are framed by 
      experiences of vulnerability that render them largely ineffective. Stimulant safe
      supply: Solutions that provide a legal and safe supply of non-adulterated
      stimulants of known quality, and within a health care framework, are needed to
      directly address the risk of an increasingly adulterated stimulant supply.
      Similar innovative opioid-focused interventions are being piloted with
      medications that have a similar pharmacological effect as their illicit
      counterparts. While there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for
      stimulant use, research has demonstrated a number of stimulant medications that
      are promising substitutes for cocaine and methamphetamine use. Much like with
      opioid-focused pharmacotherapies, having a consistent and safe supply of
      stimulants can lead to improved health outcomes and will drastically reduce
      overdose risk. However, for a stimulant safe supply intervention to be a success,
      it must provide the high and performance-enhancing effects that people seek from 
      the illicit market, which requires doses and user agency that trials to date have
      not provided. Conclusion: Efforts are needed to investigate the feasibility of
      pharmacological stimulant-based interventions that address safe supply needs. The
      promise of similar opioid-focused approaches in addressing both overdose-related 
      risks and experiences related to vulnerability underscores the need to advance
      safe supply approaches targeted towards people who use stimulants. Given the
      current overdose crisis and rising stimulant use across North America, the
      implementation and evaluation of such novel stimulant-focused interventions
      should be a public health priority.

TI  - Health care professionals’ knowledge of commonly used sedative, analgesic and
      neuromuscular drugs: A single center (Rambam Health Care Campus), prospective,
      observational survey.
LID - e0227499
AB  - Background: Pain management and sedation are important aspects in the treatment
      of hospitalized patients, especially those mechanically ventilated. In many
      hospitals, such patients are treated not only in intensive care units, but also
      in other wards. In the nineteen eighties, numerous studies demonstrated a wide
      array of misconceptions and inadequate knowledge related to commonly used
      sedative, analgesics and muscle relaxants which may prevent appropriate
      treatment. Since these publications, multiple studies have shown that appropriate
      sedation and analgesia are associated with improved clinical outcomes,
      educational programs were developed and guidelines published. Whether the
      personnel’s knowledge kept up with these changes is unknown. The aim of this
      study was to determine the current rate of misconceptions and knowledge gaps
      regarding commonly used sedative, analgesic and neuromuscular drugs. Methods: In 
      this prospective, observational, cross-sectional survey, a questionnaire was
      e-mailed to physicians and nurses routinely treating mechanically ventilated
      patients in Rambam Health Care Campus (Haifa, Israel). Results: 355
      questionnaires were returned. 82.54% knew that midazolam has no analgesic effect.
      71–72% were familiar with the sedative effect of opiates. 27% believed that
      propofol has analgesic properties and 30.52% thought that rocuronium has a
      sedative effect. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that although a lot has
      been done during the last decades in order to improve the treatment of critically
      ill patients, the rate of misconceptions regarding pharmacological
      characteristics of commonly used drugs is unacceptably high. We call for
      performance of similar surveys in other institutes and for immediate action to
      improve patients’ care.

TI  - Association between opioid analgesic therapy and initiation of buprenorphine
      management: An analysis of prescription drug monitoring program data.
LID - e0227350
AB  - Background: In the US, medication assisted treatment, particularly with
      office-based buprenorphine, has been an important component of opioid dependence 
      treatment among patients with iatrogenic addiction to opioid analgesics. The
      predictors of initiating buprenorphine for addiction among opioid analgesic
      patients have not been well-described. Methods: We conducted a time-to-event
      analysis using data from the North Carolina (NC) Prescription Drug Monitoring
      Program (PDMP). Our outcome of interest was time-to-initiation of sublingual
      buprenorphine. Our study population was a prospective cohort of all state
      residents receiving a full-agonist opioid analgesic between 2011 and 2015.
      Predictors of initiation of sublingual buprenorphine examined included: age,
      gender, cumulative pharmacies and prescribers utilized, cumulative opioid
      intensity (defined as cumulative opioid exposure divided by duration of opioid
      exposure), and benzodiazepine dispensing. Findings: Of 4.3 million patients
      receiving opioid analgesics in NC between 2011 and 2015 (accumulated 8.30 million
      person-years of follow-up), and a total of 28,904 patients initiated
      buprenorphine formulations intended for addiction treatment (overall rate 3.48
      per 1,000 person-years). In adjusted multivariate models, the utilization of 3 or
      more pharmacies (HR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.82, 3.05) or 6 or more controlled substance 
      prescribers (HR: 12.09; 95% CI: 10.76, 13.57) was associated with buprenorphine
      initiation. A dose-response relationship was observed for cumulative opioid
      intensity (HR in highest decile relative to lowest decile: 5.05; 95% CI: 4.70,
      5.42). Benzodiazepine dispensing was negatively associated with buprenorphine
      initiation (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.65). Conclusions: Opioid analgesic patients
      utilizing multiple prescribers or pharmacies are more likely to initiate
      sublingual buprenorphine. This finding suggests that patients with multiple
      healthcare interactions are more likely to be treated for high-risk opioid use,
      or may be more likely to be identified and treated for addiction. Future research
      should utilize prescription monitoring program data linked to electronic health
      records to include diagnosis information in analytic models.

TI  - ABC efflux transporters at blood-central nervous system barriers and their
      implications for treating spinal cord disorders.
PG  - 1235-42
AB  - The barriers present in the interfaces between the blood and the central nervous 
      system form a major hurdle for the pharmacological treatment of central nervous
      system injuries and diseases. The family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporters has been widely studied regarding efflux of medications at
      blood-central nervous system barriers. These efflux transporters include
      P-glycoprotein (abcb1), ‘breast cancer resistance protein’ (abcg2) and the
      various ‘multidrug resistance-associated proteins’ (abccs). Understanding which
      efflux transporters are present at the blood-spinal cord, blood-cerebrospinal
      fluid and cerebrospinal fluid-spinal cord barriers is necessary to determine
      their involvement in limiting drug transfer from blood to the spinal cord tissue.
      Recent developments in the blood-brain barrier field have shown that barrier
      systems are dynamic and the profile of barrier defenses can alter due to
      conditions such as age, disease and environmental challenge. This means that a
      true understanding of ABC efflux transporter expression and localization should
      not be one static value but instead a range that represents the complex patient
      subpopulations that exist. In the present review, the blood-central nervous
      system barrier literature is discussed with a focus on the impact of ABC efflux
      transporters on: (i) protecting the spinal cord from adverse effects of
      systemically directed drugs, and (ii) limiting centrally directed drugs from
      accessing their active sites within the spinal cord.

TI  - Challenges and Opportunities in Preclinical Research of Synthetic Cannabinoids
      for Pain Therapy.
LID - 24
AB  - Cannabis has been used in pain management since 2900 BC. In the 20th century,
      synthetic cannabinoids began to emerge, thus opening the way for improved
      efficacy. The search for new forms of synthetic cannabinoids continues and, as
      such, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive tool for the research 
      and development of this promising class of drugs. Methods for the in vitro
      assessment of cytotoxic, mutagenic or developmental effects are presented,
      followed by the main in vivo pain models used in cannabis research and the
      results yielded by different types of administration (systemic versus intrathecal
      versus inhalation). Animal models designed for assessing side-effects and
      long-term uses are also discussed. In the second part of this review,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of synthetic cannabinoid
      biodistribution, together with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometric
      identification of synthetic cannabinoids in biological fluids from rodents to
      humans are presented. Last, but not least, different strategies for improving the
      solubility and physicochemical stability of synthetic cannabinoids and their
      potential impact on pain management are discussed. In conclusion, synthetic
      cannabinoids are one of the most promising classes of drugs in pain medicine, and
      preclinical research should focus on identifying new and improved alternatives
      for a better clinical and preclinical outcome.

TI  - Current Pharmacological Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: A Narrative
      Review.
LID - 25
AB  - Background and Objectives: Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) is one of the
      most common chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. Although it is usually
      characterized by progressive sensory loss, some patients may develop chronic
      pain. Assessment of DSPN is not difficult, but the biggest challenge is making
      the correct diagnosis and choosing the right treatment. The treatment of DSPN has
      three primary objectives: glycemic control, pathogenic mechanisms, and pain
      management. The aim of this brief narrative review is to summarize the current
      pharmacological treatment of painful DSPN. It also summarizes knowledge on
      pathogenesis-oriented therapy, which is generally overlooked in many publications
      and guidelines. Materials and Methods: The present review reports the relevant
      information available on DSPN treatment. The search was performed on PubMed,
      Cochrane, Semantic Scholar, Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases,
      including among others the terms “distal symmetrical polyneuropathy”,
      “neuropathic pain treatment”, “diabetic neuropathy”, “diabetes complications”,
      ”glycaemic control”, “antidepressants”, “opioids”, and “anticonvulsants”.
      Results: First-line drugs include antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) and pregabalin. Second- and third-line 
      drugs include opioids and topical analgesics. While potentially effective in the 
      treatment of neuropathic pain, opioids are not considered to be the first choice 
      because of adverse reactions and addiction concerns. Conclusions: DSPN is a
      common complication in patients with diabetes, and severely affects the quality
      of life of these patients. Although multiple therapies are available, the
      guidelines and recommendations regarding the treatment of diabetic neuropathy
      have failed to offer a unitary consensus, which often hinders the therapeutic
      options in clinical practice.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Opioid Cessation.
LID - 180
AB  - The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) and
      overdose-related deaths. However, the genetic basis for the ability to
      discontinue opioid use has not been investigated. We performed a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) of opioid cessation (defined as abstinence from illicit 
      opioids for >1 year or <6 months before the interview date) in 1130 African
      American (AA) and 2919 European ancestry (EA) participants recruited for genetic 
      studies of substance use disorders and who met lifetime Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for OUD.
      Association tests performed separately within each ethnic group were combined by 
      meta-analysis with results obtained from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study.
      Although there were no genome-wide significant associations, we found suggestive 
      associations with nine independent loci, including three which are biologically
      relevant: rs4740988 in PTPRD (pAA + EA = 2.24 × 10−6), rs36098404 in MYOM2 (pEA =
      2.24 × 10−6), and rs592026 in SNAP25-AS1 (pEA = 6.53 × 10−6). Significant
      pathways identified in persons of European ancestry (EA) are related to vitamin D
      metabolism (p = 3.79 × 10−2) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (p =
      2.39 × 10−2). UK Biobank traits including smoking and drinking cessation and
      chronic back pain were significantly associated with opioid cessation using
      GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores. These results provide evidence for genetic
      influences on opioid cessation, suggest genetic overlap with other relevant
      traits, and may indicate potential novel therapeutic targets for OUD.

TI  - Physical Activity in Eating Disorders: A Systematic Review.
LID - 183
AB  - Abnormally high levels of physical activity have been documented throughout the
      literature in patients with eating disorders (ED), especially those diagnosed
      with anorexia nervosa (AN). Yet no clear definition, conceptualization, or
      treatment of the problematic use of physical activity (PPA) in ED patients
      exists. The aim of this review is to propose a new classification of PPA, report 
      the prevalence, triggers, predictors, maintainers and other related factors of
      PPA in ED patients, in addition to proposing a comprehensive model of the
      development of PPA in AN. A total of 47 articles, retrieved from Medline and Web 
      of Science, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. As a
      result, the new approach of PPA was divided into two groups (group 1 and group 2)
      according to the dimension (quantitative vs qualitative approach) of physical
      activity that was evaluated. The prevalence of PPA in ED was reported in 20 out
      of 47 studies, the comparison of PPA between ED versus controls in 21 articles,
      and the links between PPA and psychological factors in ED in 26 articles,
      including depression (16/26), anxiety (13/26), obsessive–compulsiveness (9/26),
      self-esteem (4/26), addictiveness (1/26), regulation and verbal expression of
      emotions (1/26) and anhedonia (1/26). The links between PPA and ED
      symptomatology, PPA and weight, body mass index (BMI) and body composition in ED,
      PPA and age, onset, illness duration and lifetime activity status in ED, PPA and 
      ED treatment outcome were reported in 18, 15, 7, 5 articles, respectively. All of
      the factors have been systematically clustered into group 1 and group 2. Results 
      focused more on AN rather than BN due to the limited studies on the latter.
      Additionally, a model for the development of PPA in AN patients was proposed,
      encompassing five periods evolving into three clinical stages. Thus, two very
      opposite components of PPA in AN were suggested: voluntarily PPA increased in AN 
      was viewed as a conscious strategy to maximize weight loss, while involuntarily
      PPA increased proportionally with weight-loss, indicating that exercise might be 
      under the control of a subconscious biological drive and involuntary cognition.

TI  - A Well-Trained Team During Anaphylactic Shock After Rocuronium in a Patient With 
      Aortic Stenosis: A Case Report.
LID - 305
AB  - A 66-year-old patient with aortic stenosis was scheduled for an aortic valve
      replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery. Anesthesia was induced by
      intravenous injection of midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol. After administration 
      of rocuronium, he developed anaphylactic shock, which was diagnosed by clinical
      signs, vital parameters, and unresponsiveness to the usual vasopressors. After 30
      min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient survived without any
      neurological deficits. This case is a reminder that early recognition and
      treatment of intraoperative hypersensitivity reactions are imperative.
      Anesthetists should also receive simulation training to achieve an adequate
      experience in a safe environment. With a well-trained team, it is possible to
      save the life of patients with aortic stenosis.

TI  - Escalated Oxycodone Self-Administration and Punishment: Differential Expression
      of Opioid Receptors and Immediate Early Genes in the Rat Dorsal Striatum and
      Prefrontal Cortex.
LID - 1392
AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is characterized by compulsive drug taking despite
      adverse life consequences. Here, we sought to identify neurobiological
      consequences associated with the behavioral effects of contingent footshocks
      administered after escalation of oxycodone self-administration. To reach these
      goals, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer oxycodone for 4 weeks 
      and were then exposed to contingent electric footshocks. This paradigm helped to 
      dichotomize rats into two distinct behavioral phenotypes: (1) those that reduce
      lever pressing (shock-sensitive) and (2) others that continue lever pressing
      (shock-resistant) for oxycodone during contingent punishment. The rats were
      euthanized at 2-h after the last oxycodone plus footshock session. The dorsal
      striata and prefrontal cortices were dissected for use in western blot and
      RT-qPCR analyses. All oxycodone self-administration rats showed significant
      decreased expression of Mu and Kappa opioid receptor proteins only in the dorsal 
      striatum. However, expression of Delta opioid receptor protein was decreased in
      both brain regions. RT-qPCR analyses documented significant decreases in the
      expression of c-fos, fosB, fra2, junB, egr1, and egr2 mRNAs in the dorsal
      striatum (but not in PFC) of the shock-sensitive rats. In the PFC, junD
      expression was reduced in both phenotypes. However, egr3 mRNA expression was
      increased in the PFC of only shock-resistant rats. These results reveal that,
      similar to psychostimulants and alcohol, footshocks can dichotomize rats that
      escalated their intake of oxycodone into two distinct behavioral phenotypes.
      These animals also show significant differences in the mRNA expression of
      immediate early genes, mainly, in the dorsal striatum. The increases in PFC egr3 
      expression in the shock-resistant rats suggest that Egr3 might be involved in the
      persistence of oxycodone-associated memory under aversive conditions. This
      punishment-driven model may help to identify neurobiological substrates of
      persistent oxycodone taking and abstinence in the presence of adverse
      consequences.

TI  - Bowel movement frequency and risks of major vascular and non-vascular diseases: a
      population-based cohort study among Chinese adults.
LID - e031028
AB  - Objective: The application of bowel movement frequency (BMF) in primary care is
      limited by the lack of solid evidence about the associations of BMF with health
      outcomes apart from Parkinson’s disease and colorectal cancer. We examined the
      prospective associations of BMF with major vascular and non-vascular diseases
      outside the digestive system. Design: Population-based prospective cohort study. 
      Setting: The China Kadoorie Biobank in which participants from 10 geographically 
      diverse areas across China were enrolled between 2004 and 2008. Participants: 487
      198 participants aged 30 to 79 years without cancer, heart disease or stroke at
      baseline were included and followed up for a median of 10 years. The usual BMF
      was self-reported once at baseline. Primary and secondary outcome measures:
      Incident events of predefined major vascular and non-vascular diseases. Results: 
      In multivariable-adjusted analyses, participants having bowel movements ‘more
      than once a day’ had higher risks of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), heart
      failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared with the reference group (‘once a
      day’). The respective HRs (95% CIs) were 1.12 (1.09 to 1.16), 1.33 (1.22 to
      1.46), 1.28 (1.22 to 1.36), 1.20 (1.15 to 1.26) and 1.15 (1.07 to 1.24). The
      lowest BMF (‘less than three times a week’) was also associated with higher risks
      of IHD, major coronary events, ischaemic stroke and CKD. The respective HRs were 
      1.07 (1.02 to 1.12), 1.22 (1.10 to 1.36), 1.11 (1.05 to 1.16) and 1.20 (1.07 to
      1.35). Conclusion: BMF was associated with future risks of multiple vascular and 
      non-vascular diseases. The integration of BMF assessment and health counselling
      into primary care should be considered.

TI  - Postoperative intravenous parecoxib sodium followed by oral celecoxib post total 
      knee arthroplasty in osteoarthritis patients (PIPFORCE): a multicentre,
      double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
LID - e030501
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the morphine-sparing effects of the sequential treatment 
      versus placebo in subjects undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the effects 
      on pain relief, inflammation control and functional rehabilitation after TKA and 
      safety. Design: Double-blind, pragmatic, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
      Setting: Four tertiary hospitals in China. Participants: 246 consecutive patients
      who underwent elective unilateral TKA because of osteoarthritis (OA).
      Interventions: Patients were randomised 1:1 to the parecoxib/celecoxib group or
      the control group. The patients in the parecoxib/celecoxib group were supplied
      sequential treatment with intravenous parecoxib 40 mg (every 12 hours) for the
      first 3 days after surgery, followed by oral celecoxib 200 mg (every 12 hours)
      for up to 6 weeks. The patients in the control group were supplied with the
      corresponding placebo under the same instructions. Primary and secondary outcome 
      measures: The primary endpoint was the cumulative opioid consumption at 2 weeks
      post operation (intention-to-treat analysis). Secondary endpoints included the
      Knee Society Score, patient-reported outcomes and the cumulative opioid
      consumption. Results: The cumulative opioid consumption at 2 weeks was
      significantly smaller in the parecoxib/celecoxib group than in the control group 
      (median difference, 57.31 (95% CI 34.66 to 110.33)). The parecoxib/celecoxib
      group achieving superior Knee Society Scores and EQ-5D scores and greater Visual 
      Analogue Scale score reduction during 6 weeks. Interleukin 6, erythrocyte
      sedation rate and C-reactive protein levels were reduced at 72 hours, 2 weeks and
      4 weeks and prostaglandin E2 levels were reduced at 48 hours and 72 hours in the 
      parecoxib/celecoxib group compared with the placebo group. The occurrence of
      adverse events (AEs) was significantly lower in the parecoxib/celecoxib group.
      Conclusions: The sequential intravenous parecoxib followed by oral celecoxib
      regimen reduces morphine consumption, achieves better pain control and functional
      recovery and leads to less AEs than placebo after TKA for OA. Trial registration 
      number: ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT02198924).

TI  - The effect of gestational diabetes mellitus on sufentanil consumption after
      cesarean section: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown that patients with long-term diabetes
      require more opioids after surgery than patients without diabetes. Gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) normally only lasts for a brief period; nevertheless, its
      effect on sufentanil consumption after cesarean section is unknown. Methods: This
      prospective cohort study included two groups: a GDM group (n = 32) and a matched 
      non-GDM (NGDM) group (n = 32). All patients underwent routine combined
      spinal-epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Sufentanil consumption through 
      an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, the frequency of PCA
      requests, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores 6 and 24 h after surgery were
      compared between groups. Results: Sufentanil consumption (μg) 6 h after surgery
      was higher in the GDM group than in the NGDM group (24.0 ± 6.6 vs 20.1 ± 5.7,
      P = 0.023). PCA was used more frequently 6 and 24 h after surgery by the GDM
      group than by the NGDM group (1[0–2] vs 0[0–1], P = 0.001; 6 [1–5] vs 3 [1, 2,
      6–8], P = 0.001, respectively). The VAS score during activity 24 h after surgery 
      was higher in the GDM group than in the NGDM group (5 [2, 3] vs 5 [1, 2],
      respectively, P = 0.03). Conclusion: Pregnant women with GDM require more opioids
      during the immediate postoperative period after cesarean section than those
      without GDM. Clinical trials registration: No. ChiCTR1800016014, ChenYang, May

TI  - Technical and clinical evaluation of a closed loop TIVA system with SEDLineTM
      spectral density monitoring: Multicentric prospective cohort study.
LID - 1
AB  - Introduction: Closed loop total intravenous anesthesia is a technique in which
      the patient’s hemodynamic and anesthetic depth variables are monitored, and based
      on this information, a computer controls the infusion rate of drugs to keep them 
      within pre-established clinical parameters. Objective: To describe the technical 
      and clinical performance of a closed loop system for total intravenous anesthesia
      with propofol and remifentanil, using the SEDLineTM monitor Design: Multicentric 
      prospective cohort study Setting: Surgery room Patients: ASA I-II undergoing
      elective surgery Measurements: The authors designed a closed loop system that
      implements a control algorithm based on anesthetic depth monitoring and the
      Patient State Index (PSITM) of the SEDLine monitor for propofol, and on
      hemodynamic variables for remifentanil. The measurement of clinical performance
      was made based on the percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the range 20–50.
      Precision analysis was evaluated by measuring median performance error (MDPE) can
      be defined as the median difference between actual and desired values, which
      refers to the degree of precision in which the controller is able to maintain the
      control variable within the objective set by the anesthesiologist; it represents 
      the direction (over-prediction or under-prediction) of performance error (PE)
      rather than size of errors, which is represented by MDAPE, median absolute
      percentage error, Wobble index, which is used for measuring the intrasubject
      variability in performance error. Results: Data were obtained from 93 patients in
      three healthcare centers. The percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the 20–50
      range was 92% (80.7–97.0). MDPE was 10.7 (− 11.0–18.0), MDAPE 21.0 (14.2–26.8)
      and wobble 10.7 (7.0–16.9). No adverse surgical or anesthetic events were found. 
      Conclusions: The closed loop total intravenous anesthesia system with SEDLine
      developed by the authors was used without major complication and appear to be
      feasible its use in clinical performance.

TI  - Mortality in a cohort of 3.1 million children, adolescents and young adults.
PG  - 260-8
AB  - Background: Many youth deaths occur in the first year of life, from prematurity
      and anomalies. Detailing mortality after age 1 year may differentially guide
      preventive strategies in children, adolescents and young adults. Methods: A
      cohort study in Ontario, Canada comprised 3 139 698 children born from 1990 to
      2016. Adjusted HR (aHR) for death between 1 and 24 years were generated,
      comparing demographic variables and parity. Results: After a median of 13.7 years
      of follow-up, 6930 deaths occurred between ages 1 and 24 years (incidence rate
      17.0 per 100 000 person-years), peaking at age 23 years (43.7 per 100 000). The
      aHR for death was higher among males than females (1.44, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.51),
      rural versus urban areas (1.48, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.58), lowest versus highest
      income areas (1.39, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51) and at parity 1 (1.16, 95% CI 1.10 to
      1.23), parity 2 (1.34, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.45), parity 3+ (1.96, 95% CI 1.74 to
      2.21), each relative to a child without an older sibling. Among males, the
      proportion of deaths due to injury jumped from 30% before age 15 years to 65%
      thereafter, and in females, from 28% to 51%. Intentional self-harm/assault
      explained 11% of injury-related deaths among males before age 15 years, and 20%
      thereafter, with respective figures of 18% and 17% for females. Deaths outside of
      hospital increased with age, from 35% at age 1 year, to 66% at age 22 years.
      Conclusion: There is a heightened susceptibility of dying starting at age 15
      years, especially among males, from injury, and arising outside of hospital.

TI  - Long‐Term Safety Evaluation of Ubrogepant for the Acute Treatment of Migraine:
      Phase 3, Randomized, 52‐Week Extension Trial.
PG  - 141-52
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the long‐term safety and tolerability of ubrogepant for
      the acute treatment of migraine. Background: Ubrogepant is an oral, calcitonin
      gene–related receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of
      migraine. The efficacy of ubrogepant was demonstrated in 2 phase 3 trials in
      which a significant improvement was observed in migraine headache pain,
      migraine‐associated symptoms, and ability to function. Methods: This was a phase 
      3, multicenter, randomized, open‐label, 52‐week extension trial. Adults with
      migraine with or without aura entered the trial after completing one of 2 phase 3
      lead‐in trials and were re‐randomized 1:1:1 to usual care, ubrogepant 50 mg, or
      ubrogepant 100 mg. Randomization to ubrogepant dose was blinded. Those randomized
      to usual care continued to treat migraine attacks with their own medication. The 
      usual care arm was included in this trial to capture background rates of hepatic 
      laboratory parameters and contextualize hepatic safety assessments. Safety and
      tolerability were the primary outcome measures. The safety population for the
      ubrogepant arms included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose
      of treatment. All cases of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST) elevations of ≥3 times the upper limit of normal were
      adjudicated by an independent panel of liver experts who were blinded to dose.
      Results: The safety population included 1230 participants (404 in the ubrogepant 
      50‐mg group, 409 in the ubrogepant 100‐mg group, and 417 in the usual care
      group). Participants were on average 42 years of age, 90% (1106/1230) female and 
      85% (1043/1230) white, with an average BMI of 30 kg/m2. Throughout the trial,
      21,454 migraine attacks were treated with 31,968 doses of ubrogepant.
      Treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 268/404 (66%)
      participants receiving ubrogepant 50 mg and 297/409 (73%) receiving ubrogepant
      100 mg. The most commonly reported TEAE was upper respiratory tract infection
      (<12%); findings were similar across dose groups. Treatment‐related TEAEs were
      reported by 42/404 (10%) participants in the ubrogepant 50‐mg group and 43/409
      (11%) in the ubrogepant 100‐mg group. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported
      by 9/404 (2%) participants in the ubrogepant 50‐mg group and 12/409 (3%)
      participants in the ubrogepant 100‐mg group. Twenty cases of ALT/AST levels of ≥3
      times the upper limit of normal were reported and reviewed by an independent
      clinical adjudication committee of liver experts. There were no cases of Hy’s
      Law. Conclusions: Long‐term intermittent use of ubrogepant 50 and 100 mg given as
      1 or 2 doses per attack for the acute treatment of migraine was safe and well
      tolerated, as indicated by a low incidence of treatment‐related TEAEs and SAEs
      and discontinuations due to adverse events in this 1‐year trial.

TI  - Exploring psychological symptoms and associated factors in patients receiving
      medication-assisted treatment for opioid-use disorder.
LID - e8
AB  - Background: Patients receiving treatment for opioid-use disorder (OUD) may
      experience psychological symptoms without meeting full criteria for psychiatric
      disorders. The impact of these symptoms on treatment outcomes is unclear. Aims:
      To determine the prevalence of psychological symptoms in a cohort of individuals 
      receiving medication-assisted treatment for OUD and explore their association
      with patient characteristics and outcomes in treatment. Method: Data were
      collected from 2788 participants receiving ongoing treatment for OUD recruited in
      two Canadian prospective cohort studies. The Maudsley Addiction Profile
      psychological symptoms subscale was administered to all participants via
      face-to-face interviews. A subset of participants (n = 666) also received
      assessment for psychiatric disorders with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
      Interview. We used linear regression analysis to explore factors associated with 
      psychological symptom score. Results: The mean psychological symptom score was
      12.6/40 (s.d. = 9.2). Participants with psychiatric comorbidity had higher scores
      than those without (mean 16.8 v. 8.6, P<0.001) and 31% of those with psychiatric 
      comorbidity reported suicidal ideation. Higher psychological symptom score was
      associated with female gender (B = 1.59, 95% CI 0.92–2.25, P<0.001),
      antidepressant prescription (B = 4.35, 95% CI 3.61–5.09, P<0.001), percentage of 
      opioid-positive urine screens (B = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01–0.03, P<0.001), and use of
      non-opioid substances (B = 1.92, 95% CI 0.89–2.95, P<0.001). Marriage and
      employment were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusions:
      Psychological symptoms are associated with treatment outcomes in this population 
      and the prevalence of suicidal ideation is an area of concern. Our findings
      highlight the ongoing need to optimise integrated mental health and addictions
      services for patients with OUD.

TI  - A multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial of rifampin to reduce pedal
      amputations for osteomyelitis in veterans with diabetes (VA INTREPID).
LID - 23
AB  - Background: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus continues to inexorably rise in
      the United States and throughout the world. Lower limb amputations are a
      devastating comorbid complication of diabetes mellitus. Osteomyelitis increases
      the risk of amputation fourfold and commonly presages death.Antimicrobial therapy
      for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) varies greatly, indicating that high
      quality data are needed to inform clinical decision making. Several small trials 
      have indicated that the addition of rifampin to backbone antimicrobial regimens
      for osteomyelitis outside the setting of the diabetic foot results in 28 to 42%
      higher cure rates. Methods/design: This is a prospective, randomized,
      double-blind investigation of the addition of 6 weeks of rifampin, 600 mg daily, 
      vs. matched placebo (riboflavin) to standard-of-care, backbone antimicrobial
      therapy for DFO. The study population are patients enrolled in Veteran Health
      Administration (VHA), ages ≥18 and ≤ 89 years with diabetes mellitus and definite
      or probable osteomyelitis of the foot for whom an extended course of oral or
      intravenous antibiotics is planned. The primary endpoint is amputation-free
      survival. The primary hypothesis is that using rifampin as adjunctive therapy
      will lower the hazard rate compared with the group that does not use rifampin as 
      adjunctive therapy. The primary hypothesis will be tested by means of a two-sided
      log-rank test with a 5% significance level. The test has 90% power to detect a
      hazard ratio of 0.67 or lower with a total of 880 study participants followed on 
      average for 1.8 years. Discussion: VA INTREPID will test if a rifampin-adjunctive
      antibiotic regimen increases amputation-free survival in patients seeking care in
      the VHA with DFO. A positive finding and its adoption by clinicians would reduce 
      lower extremity amputations and their associated physical and emotional impact
      and reduce mortality for Veterans and for the general population with diabetic
      foot osteomyelitis. Given that rifampin-adjunctive regimens are currently
      employed for therapy for the majority of DFO cases in Europe, and only in a small
      minority of cases in the United States, the trial results will impact therapeutic
      decisions, even if the null hypothesis is not rejected. Trial registration:
      Registered January 6, 2017 at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03012529.

TI  - Anaphylaxis-Induced Atrial Fibrillation and Anesthesia: Pathophysiologic and
      Therapeutic Considerations.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in western society
      affecting more than 35 million individuals worldwide annually. It is a common
      postoperative complication and may also occur spontaneously during general and
      local anesthesia administration. Aging, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
      cardiovascular diseases including cardiomyopathies, congenital cardiac anomalies,
      heart failure, myocardial ischemia, pericarditis, previous cardiac surgery,
      vascular disease, and valvular heart disease are some correlated factors. Beyond 
      age, increased incidence of atrial fibrillation has been correlated to autoimmune
      system activation as it is the underlying mechanism of persistent atrial
      fibrillation development. Current research supports an association between the
      complement system activation and lymphocyte-pro-inflammatory cytokines release
      with the cardiac conduction system and atrial fibrosis. The loss of CD28 antigen 
      from CD4+ CD28+ T lymphocytes seems to play a major role in atrial fibrillation
      development and prognosis. Except atrial fibrillation, a variety of additional
      electrocardiographic changes, resembling those with digitalis intoxication may
      accompany anaphylaxis and particularly Kounis syndrome. Histamine is one
      well-known mediator in allergic and inflammatory conditions as physiologically
      regulates several cardiovascular and endothelial functions with arrhythmogenic
      potential. The increased oxidative stress, measured by the redox potentials of
      glutathione, has been correlated with atrial fibrillation incidence and
      prevalence. The use of antazoline, a first-generation antihistamine agent used
      for rapid conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with
      preserved left ventricular function and for rapid atrial fibrillation termination
      during accessory pathway ablation denotes that anaphylaxis-induced histamine
      production could be the cause of atrial fibrillation at least in some instances. 
      The anaphylaxis diagnosis in anesthesia can be challenging owing to the absence
      of cutaneous manifestetions such as flushing, urticaria, or angioedema.
      Anticoagulation for stroke prevention, rate and rhythm control medications,
      invasive methods such as radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation of pulmonary
      veins as well surgical ablation constitute the treatment basis of atrial
      fibrillation. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of atrial fibrillation by
      cardiologists, anesthesiologists and surgeons, as well as potential treatments,
      to optimize care is of paramount importance.

TI  - Gender Informed or Gender Ignored? Opportunities for Gender Transformative
      Approaches in Brief Alcohol Interventions on College Campuses.
LID - 396
AB  - Brief alcohol interventions are an effective strategy for reducing harmful and
      risky alcohol use and misuse. Many effective brief alcohol interventions include 
      information and advice about an individual’s alcohol use, changing their use, and
      assistance in developing strategies and goals to help reduce their use. Emerging 
      research suggests that brief interventions can also be expanded to address
      multiple health outcomes; recognizing that the flexible nature of these
      approaches can be helpful in tailoring information to specific population groups.
      This scoping review synthesizes evidence on the inclusion of sex and gender in
      brief alcohol interventions on college campuses, highlighting available evidence 
      on gender responsiveness in these interventions. Furthermore, this scoping review
      offers strategies on how brief alcohol interventions can be gender
      transformative, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of brief alcohol
      interventions as harm reduction and prevention strategies, and in promoting
      gender equity.

TI  - No Differences in the Prevalence and Intensity of Chronic Postsurgical Pain
      Between Laparoscopic Hysterectomy and Abdominal Hysterectomy: A Prospective
      Study.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Objective: To compare the prevalence and characteristics of chronic postsurgical 
      pain (CPSP) between laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) and abdominal hysterectomy
      (AH) groups 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, and to assess the impact of pain
      on the activities of daily living (ADL) of patients. Methods: The demographic
      characteristics, intraoperative clinical factors, and postoperative pain score
      were collected prospectively in patients scheduled for elective LH or AH for
      benign disease at our institution from July 2014 to June 2015. Patients were
      interviewed by telephone and followed up for pain assessment 3, 6, and 12 months 
      after surgery. The prevalence, intensity, and specific locations of pain, as well
      as analgesic administration and impact on the ADL, were included in the
      questionnaire. Results: The results from 406 patients (225 patients in the LH
      group and 181 patients in the AH group) were obtained. Three months after
      surgery, the prevalence of CPSP was 20.9% in the LH group and 20.4% in the AH
      group. At 6 months, the prevalence of pain declined to 11.6% in the LH group and 
      9.4% in the AH group. At 12 months after surgery, only 13 (5.8%) patients in the 
      LH group and 11 (6.1%) patients in the AH group complained about persistent pain.
      The prevalence of CPSP, as well as the average numerical rating scale pain scores
      at rest and during movement, during 12 months after surgery were not
      significantly different between the groups. CPSP after hysterectomy exhibited a
      negative impact on the ADL. Conclusion: The prevalence and intensity of CPSP were
      not significantly different between patients undergoing LH or AH within 12 months
      after surgery. A tendency towards a reduction in chronic pain over time was
      documented. Chronic post-hysterectomy pain exhibited a negative impact on the
      ADL.

TI  - Enhanced External Counterpulsation Efficacy on Exercise Endurance in COPD
      Patients and Healthy Subjects: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - Purpose: Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is popular in China for the
      treatment of coronary heart diseases, but it may be an effective treatment for
      other populations. This study aimed to explore the effect of EECP on exercise
      endurance of healthy people and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      patients and provide intervention measures to improve their physical condition.
      Patients and methods: Patients were enrolled in this pilot randomized controlled 
      trial at Jiangbin Hospital, China, between March 1st and May 30th, 2018. They
      were randomly divided into the EECP and non-EECP groups. According to their
      maximal oxygen uptake, the volunteers were also sub-grouped into the normal, low 
      exercise endurance, and COPD subgroups. Differences in exercise endurance were
      evaluated between the EECP and non-EECP groups before and after treatment.
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testng included anaerobic threshold oxygen uptake
      (AT-VO2Kg), maximum oxygen uptake (Max-VO2Kg), anaerobic threshold pulse
      (AT-O2puls), anaerobic threshold metabolic equivalent (AT-Mets), and maximum
      metabolic equivalent (Max-Mets). Results: 72 volunteers were enrolled. The EECP
      and non-EECP groups were similar in terms of age, sex, body mass index, blood
      pressure, heart rate, breathing frequency, AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg, AT-O2puls,
      AT-Mets, and Max-Mets (P > 0.05) before treatment. EECP significantly improved
      AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg, AT-O2puls, AT-Mets, and Max-Mets compared with the non-EECP 
      group (P<0.05). When analyzed according to sub-groups, the AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg,
      AT-O2puls, AT-Mets, and Max-Mets of the normal, low exercise endurance, and COPD 
      subgroups were all significantly increased after EECP (P<0.05). Conclusion: EECP 
      significantly improved the exercise endurance of normal adults, low endurance
      adults, and COPD patients. Registration number: ChiCTR1900021993.

TI  - Identifying appropriate outcomes to help evaluate the impact of the Canadian
      Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for Non-Cancer Pain.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: The Canadian Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for
      Chronic Non-Cancer Pain (COG) was developed in response to increasing rates of
      opioid-related hospital visits and deaths in Canada, and uncertain benefits of
      opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Following publication, we developed a
      list of evaluable outcomes to assess the impact of this guideline on practice and
      patient outcomes. Methods: A working group at the National Pain Centre at
      McMaster University used a modified Delphi process to construct a list of
      clinical and patient outcomes important in assessing the uptake and application
      of the COG. An advisory group then reviewed this list to determine the relevance 
      and feasibility of each outcome, and identified potential data sources. This
      feedback was reviewed by the National Faculty for the Guideline, and a National
      Advisory Group that included the creators of the COG, resulting in the final list
      of 5 priority outcomes. Results: Five outcomes were judged clinically important
      and feasible to measure: 1) Effects of opioids for CNCP on quality of life, 2)
      Assessment of patient’s risk of addiction before starting opioid therapy, 3)
      Monitoring patients on opioid therapy for aberrant drug-related behaviour, 4)
      Mortality rates associated with prescription opioid overdose and 5) Use of
      treatment agreements with patients before initiating opioid therapy for CNCP.
      Data sources for these outcomes included patient’s medical charts, e-Opioid
      Manager, prescription monitoring programs and administrative databases.
      Conclusion: Measuring the impact of best practice guidelines is infrequently
      done. Future research should consider capturing the five outcomes identified in
      this study to evaluate the impact of the COG in promoting evidence-based use of
      opioids for CNCP.

TI  - Why Are Women Prone to Restless Legs Syndrome?
LID - 368
AB  - Restless legs syndrome is a relatively common neurologic disorder considerably
      more prevalent in women than in men. It is characterized by an
      inactivity-induced, mostly nocturnal, uncomfortable sensation in the legs and an 
      urge to move them to make the disagreeable sensation disappear. Some known genes 
      contribute to this disorder and the same genes contribute to an overlapping
      condition—periodic leg movements that occur during sleep and result in insomnia. 
      Dopamine and glutamate transmission in the central nervous system are involved in
      the pathophysiology, and an iron deficiency has been shown in region-specific
      areas of the brain. A review of the literature shows that pregnant women are at
      particular risk and that increased parity is a predisposing factor.
      Paradoxically, menopause increases the prevalence and severity of symptoms. This 
      implies a complex role for reproductive hormones. It suggests that changes rather
      than absolute levels of estrogen may be responsible for the initiation of
      symptoms. Both iron (at relatively low levels in women) and estrogen (at
      relatively high oscillating levels in women) influence dopamine and glutamate
      transmission, which may help to explain women’s vulnerability to this condition. 
      The syndrome is comorbid with several disorders (such as migraine, depression,
      and anxiety) to which women are particularly prone. This implies that the
      comorbid condition or its treatment, or both, contribute to the much higher
      prevalence in women than in men of restless legs syndrome.

TI  - Circadian disruption of core body temperature in trauma patients: a single-center
      retrospective observational study.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: Circadian clock alterations were poorly reported in trauma patients, 
      although they have a critical role in human physiology. Core body temperature is 
      a clinical variable regulated by the circadian clock. Our objective was to
      identify the circadian temperature disruption in trauma patients and to determine
      whether these disruptions were associated with the 28-day mortality rate.
      Methods: A retrospective and observational single-center cohort study was
      conducted. All adult severe trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit
      of Aix Marseille University, North Hospital, from November 2013 to February 2018,
      were evaluated. The variations of core body temperature for each patient were
      analyzed between days 2 and 3 after intensive care unit admission. Core body
      temperature variations were defined by three parameters: mesor, amplitude, and
      period. A logistic regression model was used to determine the variables
      influencing these three parameters. A survival analysis was performed assessing
      the association between core body temperature rhythm disruption and 28-day
      mortality rate. A post hoc subgroup analysis focused on the patients with head
      trauma. Results: Among the 1584 screened patients, 248 were included in this
      study. The period differed from 24 h in 177 (71%) patients. The mesor value (°C) 
      was associated with body mass index and ketamine use. Amplitude (°C) was
      associated with ketamine use only. The 28-day mortality rate was 18%. For all
      trauma patients, age, body mass index, intracranial hypertension, and amplitude
      were independent risk factors. The patients with a mesor value < 36.9 °C
      (p < 0.001) and an amplitude > 0.6 °C (p < 0.001) had a higher 28-day mortality
      rate. Among the patients with head trauma, mesor and amplitude were identified as
      independent risk factors (HR = 0.40, 95% CI [0.23–0.70], p = 0.001 and HR = 4.73,
      95% CI [1.38–16.22], p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our results highlight an association
      between core body temperature circadian alteration and 28-day mortality rate.
      This association was more pronounced in the head trauma patients than in the
      non-head trauma patients. Further studies are needed to show a causal link and
      consider possible interventions.

TI  - Patients with more comorbidities have better detection of chronic conditions, but
      poorer management and control: findings from six middle-income countries.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is rising rapidly in
      middle-income countries (MICs), where NCDs are often undiagnosed, untreated and
      uncontrolled. How comorbidity impacts diagnosis, treatment, and control of NCDs
      is an emerging area of research inquiry and have important clinical implications 
      as highlighted in the recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
      guidelines for treating patients suffering from multiple NCDs. This is the first 
      study to examine the association between increasing numbers of comorbidities with
      being undiagnosed, untreated, and uncontrolled for NCDs, in 6 large MICs.
      Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organisation Study of
      Global Ageing and Adult Health (WHO SAGE) Wave 1 (2007–10), which consisted of
      adults aged ≥18 years from 6 populous MICs, including China, Ghana, India,
      Mexico, Russia and South Africa (overall n = 41, 557). Results: A higher number
      of comorbidities was associated with better odds of diagnosis for hypertension,
      angina, and arthritis, and higher odds of having treatment for hypertension and
      angina. However, more comorbidities were associated with increased odds of
      uncontrolled hypertension, angina, arthritis, and asthma. Comorbidity with
      concordant conditions was associated with improved diagnosis and treatment of
      hypertension and angina. Conclusion: Patients with more comorbidities have better
      diagnosis of chronic conditions, but this does not translate into better
      management and control of these conditions. Patients with multiple NCDs are high 
      users of health services and are at an increased risk of adverse health outcomes.
      Hence, improving their access to care is a priority for healthcare systems.

TI  - Preferences for methadone clinics among drug users in Vietnam: a comparison
      between public and private models.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been proven to be effective
      in treating opioid dependence. In Vietnam, MMT services are provided primarily by
      public clinics, with only one private MMT clinic established in recent years.
      Assessing the preferences of patients for different MMT models is important in
      evaluating the feasibility of these models. This study measured the preferences
      of drug users enrolling in public and private MMT clinics in Vietnam and examines
      the related factors of these preferences. Methods: A cross-sectional study was
      performed on 395 participants at 3 methadone clinics in Nam Dinh. Data about the 
      preferences for MMT models and sociodemographic characteristics of participants
      were collected. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to explore the construct
      validity of the questionnaire. The chi-square test and Mann-Whitney test were
      used for analyzing demographic characteristics and preferences of participants.
      Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with participants’
      preferences. Results: Half the participants received MMT treatment in a private
      facility (49.4%). Two preference dimensions were defined as “Availability and
      convenience of service” and “Competencies of clinic and health professionals”.
      Self-employed patients were more likely to consider these two dimensions when
      choosing MMT models. Only 9.9% of participants chose “Privacy” as one of the
      evaluation criteria for an MMT facility. Compared to public clinics, a
      statistically higher percentage of patients in the private clinic chose the
      attitudes of health workers as the reason for using MMT service (34.7% and 7.6%
      respectively). Mean score of satisfaction towards MMT services was 8.6 (SD =
      1.0), and this score was statistically higher in a public facility, compared to
      the private facility (8.7 and 8.4 respectively). Conclusions: The study
      highlighted patterns of patient preferences towards MMT clinics. Compared to the 
      public MMT model, the private MMT model may need to enhance their services to
      improve patient satisfaction.

TI  - A cluster randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      Implementation of Infant Pain Practice Change (ImPaC) Resource to improve pain
      practices in hospitalized infants: a study protocol.
LID - 16
AB  - Background: Hospitalized infants undergo multiple painful procedures daily.
      Despite the significant evidence, procedural pain assessment and management
      continues to be suboptimal. Repetitive and untreated pain at this vital
      developmental juncture is associated with negative behavioral and
      neurodevelopmental consequences. To address this knowledge to practice gap, we
      developed the web-based Implementation of Infant Pain Practice Change (ImPaC)
      Resource to guide change in healthcare professionals’ pain practice behaviors.
      This protocol describes the evaluation of the intervention effectiveness and
      implementation of the Resource and how organizational context influences
      outcomes. Methods: An effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 design, blending
      a cluster randomized clinical trial and a mixed-methods implementation study will
      be used. Eighteen Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) across Canada will be
      randomized to intervention (INT) or standard practice (SP) groups. NICUs in the
      INT group will receive the Resource for six months; those in the SP group will
      continue with practice as usual and will be offered the Resource after a
      six-month waiting period. Data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. To
      address the intervention effectiveness, the INT and SP groups will be compared on
      clinical outcomes including the proportion of infants who have procedural pain
      assessed and managed, and the frequency and nature of painful procedures. Data
      will be collected at baseline (before randomization) and at completion of the
      intervention (six months). Implementation outcomes (feasibility, fidelity,
      implementation cost, and reach) will be measured at completion of the
      intervention. Sustainability will be assessed at six and 12 months following the 
      intervention. Organizational context will be assessed to examine its influence on
      intervention and implementation outcomes. Discussion: This mixed-methods study
      aims to determine the effectiveness and the implementation of a multifaceted
      online strategy for changing healthcare professionals’ pain practices for
      hospitalized infants. Implementation strategies that are easily and effectively
      implemented are important for sustained change. The results will inform
      healthcare professionals and decision-makers on how to address the challenges of 
      implementing the Resource within various organizational contexts. Trial

TI  - A call for consensus in defining efficacy in clinical trials for opioid
      addiction: combined results from a systematic review and qualitative study in
      patients receiving pharmacological assisted therapy for opioid use disorder.
LID - 30
AB  - Background: Given the complex nature of opioid addiction treatment and the rising
      number of available opioid substitution and antagonist therapies (OSAT), there is
      no ‘gold standard’ measure of treatment effectiveness, and each successive trial 
      measures a different set of outcomes which reflect success in arbitrary or
      opportune terms. We sought to describe the variation in current outcomes employed
      across clinical trials for opioid addiction, as well as determine whether a
      discrepancy exists between the treatment targets that patients consider important
      and how treatment effectiveness is measured in the literature. Methods: We
      searched nine commonly used databases (e.g., EMBASE, MEDLINE) from inception to
      August 1, 2015. Outcomes used across trials were extracted and categorized
      according to previously established domains. To evaluate patient-reported goals
      of treatment, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 adults undergoing
      methadone treatment. Results: We identified 60 trials eligible for inclusion.
      Once outcomes were categorized into eight broad domains (e.g.,
      abstinence/substance abuse), we identified 21 specific outcomes with furthermore 
      53 subdomains and 118 measurements. Continued opioid use and treatment retention 
      were the most commonly reported measures (46%, n = 28). The majority of patients 
      agreed that abstinence from opioids was a primary goal in their treatment,
      although they also stressed goals under-reported in clinical trials. Conclusions:
      There is inconsistency in the measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of
      OSATs. Individual and population level decision making is being guided by a
      standard of effect considered useful to researchers yet in direct conflict with
      what patients deem important. Trial registration: PROSPERO, CRD42013006507.

TI  - Adverse drug reactions in primary care: a scoping review.
LID - 5
AB  - Background: Medication-related adverse events, or adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
      are harmful events caused by medication. ADRs could have profound effects on the 
      patients’ quality of life, as well as creating an increased burden on the
      healthcare system. ADRs are one of the rising causes of morbidity and mortality
      internationally, and will continue to be a significant public health issue with
      the increased complexity in medication, to treat various diseases in an aging
      society. This scoping review aims to provide a detailed map of the most common
      adverse drug reactions experienced in primary healthcare setting, the drug
      classes that are most commonly associated with different levels/types of adverse 
      drug reactions, causes of ADRs, their prevalence and consequences of experiencing
      ADRs. Methods: We systematically reviewed electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE,
      Embase, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and
      Scopus. In addition, the National Patient Safety Foundation Bibliography and the 
      Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and Patient Safety Net Bibliography
      were searched. Studies published from 1990 onwards until December 7, 2018 were
      included as the incidence of reporting drug reactions were not prevalent before
      1990. We only include studies published in English. Results: The final search
      yielded a total of 19 citations for inclusion published over a 15-year period
      that primarily focused on investigating the different types of adverse drug
      reactions in primary healthcare. The most causes of adverse events were related
      to drug related and allergies. Idiosyncratic adverse reactions were not very
      commonly reported. The most common adverse drug reactions reported in the studies
      included in this review were those that are associated with the central nervous
      system, gastrointestinal system and cardiovascular system. Several classes of
      medications were reported to be associated with adverse events. Conclusion: This 
      scoping review identified that the most causes of ADRs were drug related and due 
      to allergies. Idiosyncratic adverse reactions were not very commonly reported in 
      the literature. This is mainly because it is hard to predict and these reactions 
      are not associated with drug doses or routes of administration. The most common
      ADRs reported in the studies included in this review were those that are
      associated with the central nervous system, gastrointestinal system and
      cardiovascular system. Several classes of medications were reported to be
      associated with ADRs.

TI  - Botulinum Neurotoxins and Cancer—A Review of the Literature.
LID - 32
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) possess an analgesic effect through several
      mechanisms including an inhibition of acetylcholine release from the
      neuromuscular junction as well as an inhibition of specific pain transmitters and
      mediators. Animal studies have shown that a peripheral injection of BoNTs impairs
      the release of major pain transmitters such as substance P, calcitonin gene
      related peptide (CGRP) and glutamate from peripheral nerve endings as well as
      peripheral and central neurons (dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord). These
      effects lead to pain relief via the reduction of peripheral and central
      sensitization both of which reflect important mechanisms of pain chronicity. This
      review provides updated information about the effect of botulinum toxin injection
      on local pain caused by cancer, painful muscle spasms from a remote cancer, and
      pain at the site of cancer surgery and radiation. The data from the literature
      suggests that the local injection of BoNTs improves muscle spasms caused by
      cancerous mass lesions and alleviates the post-operative neuropathic pain at the 
      site of surgery and radiation. It also helps repair the parotid damage (fistula, 
      sialocele) caused by facial surgery and radiation and improves post-parotidectomy
      gustatory hyperhidrosis. The limited literature that suggests adding botulinum
      toxins to cell culture slows/halts the growth of certain cancer cells is also
      reviewed and discussed.

TI  - The association between genome‐wide polymorphisms and chronic postoperative pain:
      a prospective observational study.
PG  - e111-20
AB  - Chronic postoperative pain is common and can have a negative impact on quality of
      life. Recent studies show that genetic risk factors are likely to play a role,
      although only gene‐targeted analysis has been used to date. This is the first
      genome‐wide association study to identify single‐nucleotide polymorphisms
      associated with the development of chronic postoperative pain based on two
      independent cohorts. In a discovery cohort, 330 women scheduled for hysterectomy 
      were genotyped. A case–control association analysis compared patients without
      chronic postoperative pain and the 34 who had severe chronic postoperative pain
      3 months after surgery. No single‐nucleotide polymorphisms reached genome‐wide
      significance, but several showed suggestive associations with chronic
      postoperative pain (p < 1 × 10−5). Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms with
      significance p < 1 × 10−5 were followed up in a replication cohort consisting of 
      203 men and women scheduled for orthopaedic or abdominal surgery. Ten of these
      patients developed severe chronic postoperative pain. A single‐nucleotide
      polymorphism in NAV3 was significantly replicated with chronic postoperative pain
      in the replication cohort (p = 0.009). Meta‐analysis revealed that two loci
      (IQGAP1 and CRTC3) were significantly associated with chronic postoperative pain 
      at 3 months (IQGAP1 p = 3.93 × 10−6 β = 2.3863, CRTC3 p = 2.26 × 10−6,
      β = 2.4209). The present genome‐wide association study provides initial evidence 
      for genetic risk factors of chronic postoperative pain and supports follow‐up
      studies.

TI  - Impact of EMA regulatory label changes on systemic diclofenac initiation,
      discontinuation, and switching to other pain medicines in Scotland, England,
      Denmark, and The Netherlands.
PG  - 296-305
AB  - Purpose: In June 2013 a European Medicines Agency referral procedure concluded
      that diclofenac was associated with an elevated risk of acute cardiovascular
      events and contraindications, warnings, and changes to the product information
      were implemented across the European Union. This study measured the impact of the
      regulatory action on the prescribing of systemic diclofenac in Denmark, The
      Netherlands, England, and Scotland. Methods: Quarterly time series analyses
      measuring diclofenac prescription initiation, discontinuation and switching to
      other systemic nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAIDs), topical NSAIDs,
      paracetamol, opioids, and other chronic pain medication in those who discontinued
      diclofenac. Absolute effects were estimated using interrupted time series
      regression. Results: Overall, diclofenac prescription initiations fell during the
      observation periods of all countries. Compared with Denmark where there appeared 
      to be a more limited effect, the regulatory action was associated with
      significant immediate reductions in diclofenac initiation in The Netherlands
      (−0.42%, 95% CI, −0.66% to −0.18%), England (−0.09%, 95% CI, −0.11% to −0.08%),
      and Scotland (−0.67%, 95% CI, −0.79% to −0.55%); and falling trends in diclofenac
      initiation in the Netherlands (−0.03%, 95% CI, −0.06% to −0.01% per quarter) and 
      Scotland (−0.04%, 95% CI, −0.05% to −0.02% per quarter). There was no significant
      impact on diclofenac discontinuation in any country. The regulatory action was
      associated with modest differences in switching to other pain medicines following
      diclofenac discontinuation. Conclusions: The regulatory action was associated
      with significant reductions in overall diclofenac initiation which varied by
      country and type of exposure. There was no impact on discontinuation and variable
      impact on switching.

TI  - The Detection of Opioid Misuse and Heroin Use From Paramedic Response
      Documentation: Machine Learning for Improved Surveillance.
LID - e15645
AB  - Background: Timely, precise, and localized surveillance of nonfatal events is
      needed to improve response and prevention of opioid-related problems in an
      evolving opioid crisis in the United States. Records of naloxone administration
      found in prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) data have helped estimate
      opioid overdose incidence, including nonhospital, field-treated cases. However,
      as naloxone is often used by EMS personnel in unconsciousness of unknown cause,
      attributing naloxone administration to opioid misuse and heroin use (OM) may
      misclassify events. Better methods are needed to identify OM. Objective: This
      study aimed to develop and test a natural language processing method that would
      improve identification of potential OM from paramedic documentation. Methods:
      First, we searched Denver Health paramedic trip reports from August 2017 to April
      2018 for keywords naloxone, heroin, and both combined, and we reviewed narratives
      of identified reports to determine whether they constituted true cases of OM.
      Then, we used this human classification as reference standard and trained 4
      machine learning models (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector
      machines, and L1-regularized logistic regression). We selected the algorithm that
      produced the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for model
      assessment. Finally, we compared positive predictive value (PPV) of the highest
      performing machine learning algorithm with PPV of searches of keywords naloxone, 
      heroin, and combination of both in the binary classification of OM in unseen
      September 2018 data. Results: In total, 54,359 trip reports were filed from
      August 2017 to April 2018. Approximately 1.09% (594/54,359) indicated naloxone
      administration. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement regarding OM in the
      narrative, 57.6% (292/516) were considered to include information revealing OM.
      Approximately 1.63% (884/54,359) of all trip reports mentioned heroin in the
      narrative. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 95.5% (784/821) were
      considered to include information revealing OM. Combined results accounted for
      2.39% (1298/54,359) of trip reports. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 
      77.79% (907/1166) were considered to include information consistent with OM. The 
      reference standard used to train and test machine learning models included
      details of 1166 trip reports. L1-regularized logistic regression was the highest 
      performing algorithm (AUC=0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.97) in identifying OM. Tested on
      5983 unseen reports from September 2018, the keyword naloxone inaccurately
      identified and underestimated probable OM trip report cases (63 cases; PPV=0.68).
      The keyword heroin yielded more cases with improved performance (129 cases;
      PPV=0.99). Combined keyword and L1-regularized logistic regression classifier
      further improved performance (146 cases; PPV=0.99). Conclusions: A machine
      learning application enhanced the effectiveness of finding OM among documented
      paramedic field responses. This approach to refining OM surveillance may lead to 
      improved first-responder and public health responses toward prevention of
      overdoses and other opioid-related problems in US communities.

TI  - Treatment patterns and sequences of pharmacotherapy for patients diagnosed with
      depression in the United States: 2014 through 2019.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: Understanding how patients are treated in the real-world is vital to 
      identifying potential gaps in care. We describe the current pharmacologic
      treatment patterns for the treatment of depression. Methods: Patients with
      depression were identified from four large national claims databases during
      1/1/2014–1/31/2019. Patients had ≥2 diagnoses for depression or an inpatient
      hospitalization with a diagnosis of depression. Patients were required to have
      enrollment in the database ≥1 year prior to and 3 years following their first
      depression diagnosis. Treatment patterns were captured at the class level and
      included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, other
      antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics/sedatives, and antipsychotics. Treatment 
      patterns were captured during all available follow-up. Results: We identified
      269,668 patients diagnosed with depression. The proportion not receiving any
      pharmacological treatment during follow-up ranged from 29 to 52%. Of the treated,
      approximately half received ≥2 different classes of therapy, a quarter received
      ≥3 classes and more than 10% received 4 or more. SSRIs were the most common
      first-line treatment; however, many patients received an anxiolytic,
      hypnotic/sedative, or antipsychotic prior to any antidepressive treatment.
      Treatment with a combination of classes ranged from approximately 20% of
      first-line therapies to 40% of fourth-line. Conclusions: Many patients diagnosed 
      with depression go untreated and many others receive a non-antidepressant
      medication class as their first treatment. More than half of patients received
      more than one type of treatment class during the study follow up, suggesting that
      the first treatment received may not be optimal for most patients.

TI  - A rapid positive influence of S-ketamine on the anxiety of patients in palliative
      care: a retrospective pilot study.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: Patients in palliative care need rapid-acting pharmacological options
      for psychological distress. N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine is known to 
      have a fast onset of anti-depressant and anxiolytic action. Its S-enantiomer
      S-ketamine (or esketamine) is an analgesic used as a routine treatment for
      refractory pain as an intravenous infusion (0.25 mg/kg over 45 min). This study
      investigates whether S-ketamine pain therapy has a positive impact on
      psychological distress caused by anxiety and depression in palliative care.
      Methods: Patient routine data from a palliative care unit of a tertiary care
      hospital were used in a retrospective analysis after positive ethics approval.
      Eight patients, who received analgesic S-ketamine treatment, were compared to a
      control group matched by gender and age. The main analysis was conducted using
      three-way mixed MANOVA followed by two-way mixed ANOVA. Target variables were the
      values for anxiety and depression in the state-trait anxiety-depression inventory
      STADI. The predictor variables were the time of measurement before (T1) and after
      (T2) S-ketamine application and group membership. Results: Comparison of the
      S-ketamine group (n = 8; 4 male, 4 female; average age 52 years) with the control
      group (n = 8; 3 male, 5 female; average age 55 years) revealed a significant
      multivariate effect on anxiety and depression F(1, 14) = 4.78; p = 0.046;
      r = 0.50. The univariate comparisons showed a significant reduction of the
      anxiety scores from T1 to T2 in the S-ketamine group compared to the control
      group F(1, 14) = 10.14; p = 0.007; r = 0.65. With regard to depression, there was
      no significant reduction from T1 to T2 in the group comparison F(1, 14) = 1.60;
      p = 0.23; r = 0.32. No long-lasting effects on pain were found. Conclusions: Our 
      findings show that psychological distress of patients in palliative care may
      improve after a single administration of S-ketamine, which mainly alleviates
      anxiety in those patients. Limitations of this study arise from
      non-randomization, retrospective analysis and low sample size. Therefore, further
      prospective and ideally randomized studies are necessary.

TI  - The Evolving Microbiome from Pregnancy to Early Infancy: A Comprehensive Review.
LID - 133
AB  - Pregnancy induces a number of immunological, hormonal, and metabolic changes that
      are necessary for the mother to adapt her body to this new physiological
      situation. The microbiome of the mother, the placenta and the fetus influence the
      fetus growth and undoubtedly plays a major role in the adequate development of
      the newborn infant. Hence, the microbiome modulates the inflammatory mechanisms
      related to physiological and pathological processes that are involved in the
      perinatal progress through different mechanisms. The present review summarizes
      the actual knowledge related to physiological changes in the microbiota occurring
      in the mother, the fetus, and the child, both during neonatal period and beyond. 
      In addition, we approach some specific pathological situations during the
      perinatal periods, as well as the influence of the type of delivery and feeding.

PG  - 81-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the antipsychotics, route of administration, dosage
      regimen, and outcomes reported to prevent or treat delirium in hospitalized
      children. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts
      were searched using the keywords “haloperidol,” “olanzapine,” “quetiapine,”
      “risperidone,” “ziprasidone,” and “delirium.” Articles evaluating the use of
      these agents to manage delirium in hospitalized children that were published
      between 1946 and August 2019 were included. Two authors independently screened
      each article for inclusion. Reports were excluded if they were published
      abstracts or included fewer than 3 patients in the report. RESULTS: Thirteen
      reports that included 370 children receiving haloperidol, quetiapine, olanzapine,
      and/or risperidone for delirium treatment were reviewed. Most children received
      haloperidol (n = 131) or olanzapine (n = 125). Significant variability in dosing 
      was noted. A total of 23 patients (6.2%) had an adverse drug event, including 13 
      (56.5%) who experienced dystonia and 3 (13.0%) with a prolonged corrected QT
      interval. Most reports described improvement in delirium symptoms; however, only 
      5 reports used a validated screening tool for PICU delirium to evaluate
      antipsychotic response. CONCLUSIONS: Most reports noted efficacy with
      antipsychotics, but these reports were limited by sample size and lacked a
      validated PICU delirium tool. Future research is needed to determine the optimal 
      agent and dosage regimen to treat PICU delirium.

      Elderly.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - Elderly patients suffering from chronic cardio-pulmonary diseases commonly
      experience acute respiratory failure. As in younger patients, a well-known
      therapeutic approach of noninvasive mechanical ventilation is able to prevent
      orotracheal intubation in a large number of severe scenarios in elderly patients.
      In addition, this type of ventilation is frequently applied in elderly patients
      who refuse intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. The rate of failure of
      noninvasive ventilation may be reduced by means of the integration of new
      technological devices (i.e., high-flow nasal cannula, extracorporeal CO2 removal,
      cough assistance and high-frequency chest wall oscillation, and fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy). Ethical issues with end-of-life decisions and the choice of the
      environment are not clearly defined in the treatment of elderly with acute
      respiratory insufficiency.

TI  - Incarceration and Number of Sexual Partners After Incarceration Among Vulnerable 
      US Women, 2007–2017.
PG  - S100-8
AB  - Objectives. To examine whether women’s incarceration increases numbers of total
      and new sexual partners.Methods. US women with or at risk for HIV in a
      multicenter cohort study answered incarceration and sexual partner questions
      semiannually between 2007 and 2017. We used marginal structural models to compare
      total and new partners at visits not following incarceration with all visits
      following incarceration and visits immediately following incarceration.
      Covariates included demographics, HIV status, sex exchange, drug or alcohol use, 
      and housing instability.Results. Of the 3180 participants, 155 were incarcerated.
      Women reported 2 partners, 3 or more partners, and new partners at 5.2%, 5.2%,
      and 9.3% of visits, respectively. Relative to visits not occurring after
      incarceration, odds ratios were 2.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20, 4.85) 
      for 2 partners, 2.03 (95% CI = 0.97, 4.26) for 3 or more partners, and 3.24 (95% 
      CI = 1.69, 6.22) for new partners at visits immediately after incarceration. Odds
      ratios were similar for all visits following incarceration.Conclusions. Women had
      more total partners and new partners immediately and at all visits following
      incarceration after confounders and loss to follow-up had been taken into
      account.

TI  - Nicotinic-nAChR signaling mediates drug resistance in lung cancer.
PG  - 1125-40
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Cigarette smoking is 
      the most common risk factor for lung carcinoma; other risks include genetic
      factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, secondhand smoke, and air pollution.
      Nicotine, the primary addictive constituent of cigarettes, contributes to cancer 
      progression through activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs),
      which are membrane ligand-gated ion channels. Activation of nicotine/nAChR
      signaling is associated with lung cancer risk and drug resistance. We focused on 
      nAChR pathways activated by nicotine and its downstream signaling involved in
      regulating apoptotic factors of mitochondria and drug resistance in lung cancer. 
      Increasing evidence suggests that several sirtuins play a critical role in
      multiple aspects of cancer drug resistance. Thus, understanding the consequences 
      of crosstalk between nicotine/nAChRs and sirtuin signaling pathways in the
      regulation of drug resistance could be a critical implication for cancer therapy.

TI  - Comorbid Chronic Conditions Among Older Adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline,
      United States, 2015–2017.
LID - igz045
AB  - Background and Objectives: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the self-reported 
      experience of worsening or more frequent confusion or memory loss, may be
      associated with the development or worsening of chronic conditions or
      complicating their self-management. The objectives of this study were to (i)
      establish the prevalence of chronic conditions and multiple chronic conditions
      among adults with SCD, and (ii) compare the prevalence of chronic conditions
      among people with and without SCD and SCD-related functional limitations.
      Research Design and Methods: Data were analyzed from the Cognitive Decline module
      of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System administered in 49 states, DC, 
      and Puerto Rico during 2015–2017. Analyses included 220,221 respondents aged 45
      years or older who answered the SCD screening question and reported their chronic
      conditions. Weighted estimates were calculated and chi-square tests were used for
      comparisons. Results: Persons with a history of stroke, heart disease, and
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder had significantly higher prevalence of SCD
      compared to those without. The prevalence of having at least one chronic
      condition was higher among adults with SCD compared to adults without SCD in each
      age group (45–64 years: 77.4% vs 47.1%, p < .001; ≥65 years: 86.3% vs 73.5%, p < 
      .001). Among those with SCD, the prevalence of an SCD-related functional
      limitation was higher among those with at least one chronic condition compared to
      those with none (45–64 years: 63.3% vs 42.4%, p < .001; ≥65 years: 40.0% vs
      25.1%, p < .001). Only half of adults with SCD and a chronic condition had
      discussed their SCD with a health care professional. Discussion and Implications:
      SCD and chronic conditions commonly co-occur. Having a chronic condition was
      associated with greater SCD-related functional limitations. SCD might complicate 
      the management of chronic conditions, and patients and providers should be aware 
      of increased risk for cognitive decline in the presence of chronic diseases.

TI  - Opioid Use Fueling HIV Transmission in an Urban Setting: An Outbreak of HIV
      Infection Among People Who Inject Drugs—Massachusetts, 2015–2018.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - Objectives. To describe and control an outbreak of HIV infection among people who
      inject drugs (PWID).Methods. The investigation included people diagnosed with HIV
      infection during 2015 to 2018 linked to 2 cities in northeastern Massachusetts
      epidemiologically or through molecular analysis. Field activities included
      qualitative interviews regarding service availability and HIV risk
      behaviors.Results. We identified 129 people meeting the case definition; 116
      (90%) reported injection drug use. Molecular surveillance added 36 cases to the
      outbreak not otherwise linked. The 2 largest molecular groups contained 56 and 23
      cases. Most interviewed PWID were homeless. Control measures, including enhanced 
      field epidemiology, syringe services programming, and community outreach,
      resulted in a significant decline in new HIV diagnoses.Conclusions. We illustrate
      difficulties with identification and characterization of an outbreak of HIV
      infection among a population of PWID and the value of an intensive
      response.Public Health Implications. Responding to and preventing outbreaks
      requires ongoing surveillance, with timely detection of increases in HIV
      diagnoses, community partnerships, and coordinated services, all critical to
      achieving the goal of the national Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative.
