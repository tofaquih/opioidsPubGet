TI  - Incidence of Opioid Overdose Among Patients Using ER/LA Opioid Analgesics Before 
      and After Implementation of the Class-Wide Opioid Risk Evaluation and Mitigation 
      Strategy.
PG  - 157-69
AB  - Introduction: The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required 
      a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and
      long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics on 09 July 2012. Methods: This study
      compared the incidence of opioid overdose before (July 2010-June 2012) and after 
      (July 2013-September 2016) the initiation of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
      Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics.
      We identified patients with ≥1 ER/LA opioid dispensing in either time period in
      national data from the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and in
      United States (US) Medicaid claims data from four states. We described each
      population, calculated the incidence rate (IR) of opioid overdose, and assessed
      crude and propensity score adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing the
      overdose rate after vs before implementation of the REMS. Results: A total of
      121,229 commercially insured and 11,488 Medicaid patients were included in the
      analysis. Rates of overdose were substantially higher in Medicaid patients than
      in the commercially insured patients (IR 192.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      162.60–225.18 versus 102.60, 95% CI 93.0–112.93 in the active period). The IRRs
      for opioid overdose were 1.01 (95% CI 0.87–1.17) in the commercially insured
      population and 0.70 (95% CI 0.52–0.93) in Medicaid. Conclusion: This leveling off
      of overdose rates among commercially insured patients and decline among Medicaid 
      patients is encouraging, but it is difficult to disentangle the specific impact
      of the REMS from many other ongoing initiatives with similar goals.

TI  - The Modified WHO Analgesic Ladder: Is It Appropriate for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain?
PG  - 411-7
AB  - Introduction: From 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder has
      been used as the simple and valuable pain-relieving guidance in the
      pharmaceutical pain management, however, with the development of medical history,
      notions about pain physiology and pain management have already updated. Is the
      analgesic ladder still appropriate for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) patients?
      This study aims to analyse the current usage of the analgesic ladder in patients 
      with CNCP by evaluating previously published pertinent studies. Methods:
      Literature published in English from January 1980 to April 2019 and cited on
      PubMed database was included. Analysis on the analgesic ladder, current status of
      CNCP management, and a new revised ladder model were developed based on relevant 
      literature. Results: The WHO analgesic ladder for cancer pain is not appropriate 
      for current CNCP management. It is revised into a four-step ladder: the
      integrative therapies being adopted at each step for reducing or even stopping
      the use of opioid analgesics; interventional therapies being considered as step 3
      before upgrading to strong opioids if non-opioids and weak opioids failed in CNCP
      management. Discussion: A simple and valuable guideline in past years, the WHO
      analgesic ladder is inappropriate for the current use of CNCP control. A revised 
      four-step analgesic ladder aligned with integrative medicine principles and
      minimally invasive interventions is recommended for control of CNCP.

TI  - The Surgeon's Role in the Opioid Crisis: A Narrative Review and Call to Action.
LID - 4
AB  - Over the past two decades, there has been a sharp rise in the use of prescription
      opioids. In several countries, most notably the United States, opioid-related
      harm has been deemed a public health crisis. As surgeons are among the most
      prolific prescribers of opioids, growing attention is now being paid to the role 
      that opioids play in surgical care. While opioids may sometimes be necessary to
      provide patients with adequate relief from acute pain after major surgery, the
      impact of opioids on the quality and safety of surgical care calls for greater
      scrutiny. This narrative review summarizes the available evidence on rates of
      persistent postsurgical opioid use and highlights the need to target known risk
      factors for persistent postoperative use before patients present for surgery. We 
      draw attention to the mounting evidence that preoperative opioid exposure places 
      patients at risk of persistent postoperative use, while also contributing to an
      increased risk of several other adverse clinical outcomes. By discussing the
      prevalence of excess opioid prescribing following surgery and highlighting
      significant variations in prescribing practices between countries, we note that
      there is a pressing need to optimize postoperative prescribing practices. Guided 
      by the available evidence, we call for specific actions to be taken to address
      important research gaps and alleviate the harms associated with opioid use among 
      surgical patients.

TI  - “My life is under control with these medications”: an interpretative
      phenomenological analysis of managing chronic pain with opioids.
LID - 61
AB  - Background: The use of opioids to relieve chronic pain has increased during the
      last decades, but experiences of chronic opioid therapy (COT) (> 90 days) point
      at risks and loss of beneficial effects. Still, some patients report benefits
      from opioid medication, such as being able to stay at work. Guidelines for opioid
      use in chronic pain do not consider the individual experience of COT, including
      benefits and risks, making the first person perspective an important scientific
      component to explore. The aim of this study was to investigate the lived
      experience of managing chronic pain with opioids in a sample who have severe
      chronic pain but are able to manage their pain sufficiently to remain at work.
      Methods: We used a qualitative research design: interpretative phenomenological
      analysis. Ten individuals with chronic pain and opioid therapy were purposively
      sampled in Swedish tertiary care. Results: Three super-ordinate themes emerged
      from the analyses: Without opioids, the pain becomes the boss; Opioids as a
      salvation and a curse, and Acknowledgement of the pain and acceptance of opioid
      therapy enables transition to a novel self. The participants used opioids to
      regain control over their pain, thus reclaiming their wanted life and self, and
      sense of control over one’s life-world. Using opioids to manage pain was not
      unproblematic and some of the participants had experienced a downward spiral of
      escalating pain and uncontrollable opioid use, and stigmatisation. Conclusions:
      All participants emphasised the importance of control, regarding both pain and
      opioid use. To accomplish this, trust between participants and health care
      providers was essential for satisfactory treatment. Regardless of the potential
      sociocultural benefits of staying at work, participants had experiences of
      balancing positive and negative effects of opioid therapy, similar to what
      previous qualitative research has found.Measurable improvement of function and
      quality of life, may justify the long-term use of opioids in some cases. However,
      monitoring of adverse events should be mandatory. This requires close cooperation
      and a trusting relationship between the patients and their health care provider.

TI  - Association between opioid analgesic therapy and initiation of buprenorphine
      management: An analysis of prescription drug monitoring program data.
LID - e0227350
AB  - Background: In the US, medication assisted treatment, particularly with
      office-based buprenorphine, has been an important component of opioid dependence 
      treatment among patients with iatrogenic addiction to opioid analgesics. The
      predictors of initiating buprenorphine for addiction among opioid analgesic
      patients have not been well-described. Methods: We conducted a time-to-event
      analysis using data from the North Carolina (NC) Prescription Drug Monitoring
      Program (PDMP). Our outcome of interest was time-to-initiation of sublingual
      buprenorphine. Our study population was a prospective cohort of all state
      residents receiving a full-agonist opioid analgesic between 2011 and 2015.
      Predictors of initiation of sublingual buprenorphine examined included: age,
      gender, cumulative pharmacies and prescribers utilized, cumulative opioid
      intensity (defined as cumulative opioid exposure divided by duration of opioid
      exposure), and benzodiazepine dispensing. Findings: Of 4.3 million patients
      receiving opioid analgesics in NC between 2011 and 2015 (accumulated 8.30 million
      person-years of follow-up), and a total of 28,904 patients initiated
      buprenorphine formulations intended for addiction treatment (overall rate 3.48
      per 1,000 person-years). In adjusted multivariate models, the utilization of 3 or
      more pharmacies (HR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.82, 3.05) or 6 or more controlled substance 
      prescribers (HR: 12.09; 95% CI: 10.76, 13.57) was associated with buprenorphine
      initiation. A dose-response relationship was observed for cumulative opioid
      intensity (HR in highest decile relative to lowest decile: 5.05; 95% CI: 4.70,
      5.42). Benzodiazepine dispensing was negatively associated with buprenorphine
      initiation (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.65). Conclusions: Opioid analgesic patients
      utilizing multiple prescribers or pharmacies are more likely to initiate
      sublingual buprenorphine. This finding suggests that patients with multiple
      healthcare interactions are more likely to be treated for high-risk opioid use,
      or may be more likely to be identified and treated for addiction. Future research
      should utilize prescription monitoring program data linked to electronic health
      records to include diagnosis information in analytic models.

      qualitative evidence synthesis using meta-ethnography.
LID - e032988
AB  - Objective: To review qualitative studies on the experience of taking opioid
      medication for chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) or coming off them. Design: This
      is a qualitative evidence synthesis using a seven-step approach from the methods 
      of meta-ethnography. Data sources and eligibility criteria: We searched selected 
      databases—Medline, Embase, AMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
      Literature, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus (Science Citation Index and
      Social Science Citation Index)—for qualitative studies which provide patients’
      views of taking opioid medication for CNMP or of coming off them (June 2017,
      updated September 2018). Data extraction and synthesis: Papers were quality
      appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool, and the
      GRADE-CERQual (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
      working group - Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research)
      guidelines were applied. We identified concepts and iteratively abstracted these 
      concepts into a line of argument. Results: We screened 2994 unique citations and 
      checked 153 full texts, and 31 met our review criteria. We identified five
      themes: (1) reluctant users with little choice; (2) understanding opioids: the
      good and the bad; (3) a therapeutic alliance: not always on the same page; (4)
      stigma: feeling scared and secretive but needing support; and (5) the challenge
      of tapering or withdrawal. A new overarching theme of ‘constantly balancing’
      emerged from the data. Conclusions: People taking opioids were constantly
      balancing tensions, not always wanting to take opioids, and weighing the pros and
      cons of opioids but feeling they had no choice because of the pain. They
      frequently felt stigmatised, were not always ‘on the same page’ as their
      healthcare professional and felt changes in opioid use were often challenging.

      stay and persistent use post-discharge.
LID - e0229497
AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that opioids are often prescribed 
      and associated with complications in outpatients with cirrhosis. Less is known
      about opioids among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. We aimed to describe
      the patterns and complications of opioid use among inpatients with cirrhosis.
      Methods: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with cirrhosis
      admitted to a single hospital system from 4/4/2014 to 9/30/2015. We excluded
      hospitalizations with a surgery, invasive procedure, or palliative care/hospice
      consult in order to understand opioid use that may be avoidable. We determined
      the frequency, dosage, and type of opioids given during hospitalization. Using
      bivariable and multivariable analyses, we assessed length of stay, intensive care
      unit transfer, and in-hospital mortality by opioid use. Results: Of 217
      inpatients with cirrhosis, 118 (54.4%) received opioids during hospitalization,
      including 41.7% of patients without prior outpatient opioid prescriptions.
      Benzodiazepines or hypnotic sleep aids were given to 28.8% of opioid recipients. 
      In the multivariable model, younger age and outpatient opioid prescription were
      associated with inpatient opioids. Hospitalization was longer among opioid
      recipients (median 3.9 vs 3.0 days, p = 0.002) and this difference remained after
      adjusting for age, cirrhosis severity, and medical comorbidities. There was no
      difference in intensive care unit transfers and no deaths occurred. At discharge,
      22 patients were newly started on opioids of whom 10 (45.5%) had opioid
      prescriptions at 90 days post-discharge. Conclusion: In non-surgical inpatients
      with cirrhosis, opioid prescribing was common and associated with prolonged
      length of stay. A high proportion of patients newly discharged with opioid
      prescriptions had ongoing prescriptions at 90 days post-discharge.

TI  - Peripheral Opioid Receptor Antagonists for Opioid-Induced Constipation: A Primer 
      on Pharmacokinetic Variabilities with a Focus on Drug Interactions.
PG  - 447-56
AB  - Opioid analgesics remain a treatment option for refractory acute and chronic
      pain, despite their potential risk for abuse and adverse events (AEs). Opioids
      are associated with several common AEs, but the most bothersome is opioid-induced
      constipation (OIC). OIC is often overlooked but has the potential to affect
      patient quality of life, increase associated symptom burden, and impede long-term
      opioid compliance. The peripherally acting µ-receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) are a
      class of drugs that include methylnaltrexone, naloxegol, and naldemedine.
      Collectively, each is approved for the treatment of OIC. PAMORAs work
      peripherally in the gastrointestinal tract, without impacting the central
      analgesic effects of opioids. However, each has unique pharmacokinetic properties
      that may be impacted by coadministered drugs or food. This review focuses on
      important metabolic and pharmacokinetic principals that are pertinent to drug
      interactions involving µ-opioid receptor antagonists prescribed for OIC. It
      highlights subtle differences among the PAMORAs that may have clinical
      significance. For example, unlike naloxegol or naldemedine, methylnaltrexone is
      not a substrate for CYP3A4 or p-glycoprotein; therefore, its plasma concentration
      is not altered when coadministered with concomitant medications that are CYP3A4
      or p-glycoprotein inducers or inhibitors. With a better understanding of
      pharmacokinetic nuances of each PAMORA, clinicians will be better equipped to
      identify potential safety and efficacy considerations that may arise when PAMORAs
      are coadministered with other medications.

TI  - Predicting Opioid Use Following Discharge After Cesarean Delivery.
PG  - 118-26
AB  - PURPOSE: Although cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure in the 
      United States, postoperative opioid prescribing varies greatly. We hypothesized
      that patient characteristics, procedural characteristics, or both would be
      associated with high vs low opioid use after discharge. This information could
      help individualize prescriptions. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we
      quantified opioid use for 4 weeks following hospital discharge after cesarean
      delivery. Predischarge characteristics were obtained from health records, and
      patients self-reported total opioid use postdischarge on weekly questionnaires.
      Opioid use was quantified in milligram morphine equivalents (MMEs). Binomial and 
      Poisson regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of opioid use
      after discharge. RESULTS: Of the 233 patients starting the study, 203 (87.1%)
      completed at least 1 questionnaire and were included in analyses (86.3% completed
      all 4 questionnaires). A total of 113 patients were high users (>75 MMEs) and 90 
      patients were low users (≤75 MMEs) of opioids postdischarge. The group reporting 
      low opioid use received on average 44% fewer opioids in the 24 hours before
      discharge compared with the group reporting high opioid use (mean = 33.0 vs 59.3 
      MMEs, P <.001). Only a minority of patients (11.4% to 15.8%) stored leftover
      opioids in a locked location, and just 31 patients disposed of leftover opioids. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of predischarge opioid use can be useful as a tool to
      inform individualized opioid prescriptions, help optimize nonopioid analgesia,
      and reduce opioid use. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the impact of
      implementing such measures on prescribing practices, pain, and functional
      outcomes.

TI  - Countering opioid-induced respiratory depression by non-opioids that are
      respiratory stimulants.
LID - F1000 Faculty Rev-91
AB  - Strong opioid analgesics are the mainstay of therapy for the relief of moderate
      to severe acute nociceptive pain that may occur post-operatively or following
      major trauma, as well as for the management of chronic cancer-related pain.
      Opioid-related adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, sedation, respiratory
      depression, constipation, tolerance, and addiction/abuse liability. Of these,
      respiratory depression is of the most concern to clinicians owing to the
      potential for fatal consequences. In the broader community, opioid overdose due
      to either prescription or illicit opioids or co-administration with central
      nervous system depressants may evoke respiratory depression. To address this
      problem, there is ongoing interest in the identification of non-opioid
      respiratory stimulants to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression but
      without reversing opioid analgesia. Promising compound classes evaluated to date 
      include those that act on a diverse array of receptors including
      5-hydroxytryptamine, D 1-dopamine,
      α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA) receptor antagonists, and nicotinic acetylcholine as well as
      phosphodiesterase inhibitors and molecules that act on potassium channels on
      oxygen-sensing cells in the carotid body. The aim of this article is to review
      recent advances in the development potential of these compounds for countering
      opioid-induced respiratory depression.

TI  - Opioid Prescribing Behaviors — Prescription Behavior Surveillance System, 11
      States, 2010–2016.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Problem/Condition: In 2017, a total of 70,237 persons in the United States died
      from a drug overdose, and 67.8% of these deaths involved an opioid. Historically,
      the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States has been closely associated
      with a parallel increase in opioid prescribing and with widespread misuse of
      these medications. National and state policy makers have introduced multiple
      measures to attempt to assess and control the opioid overdose epidemic since
      2010, including improvements in surveillance systems. Period Covered: 2010–2016
      Description of System: The Prescription Behavior Surveillance System (PBSS) was
      created in 2011. Its goal was to track rates of prescribing of controlled
      substances and possible misuse of such drugs using data from selected state
      prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP). PBSS data measure prescribing
      behaviors for prescription opioids using multiple measures calculated from PDMP
      data including 1) opioid prescribing, 2) average daily opioid dosage, 3)
      proportion of patients with daily opioid dosages ≥90 morphine milligram
      equivalents, 4) overlapping opioid prescriptions, 5) overlapping opioid and
      benzodiazepine prescriptions, and 6) multiple-provider episodes. For this
      analysis, PBSS data were available for 2010–2016 from 11 states representing
      approximately 38.0% of the U.S. population. Average quarterly percent changes
      (AQPC) in the rates of opioid prescribing and possible opioid misuse measures
      were calculated for each state. Results and Interpretation: Opioid prescribing
      rates declined in all 11 states during 2010–2016 (range: 14.9% to 33.0%). Daily
      dosage declined least (AQPC: -0.4%) in Idaho and Maine, and most (AQPC: -1.6%) in
      Florida. The percentage of patients with high daily dosage had AQPCs ranging from
      -0.4% in Idaho to -2.3% in Louisiana. Multiple-provider episode rates declined by
      at least 62% in the seven states with available data. Variations in trends across
      the 11 states might reflect differences in state policies and possible
      differential effects of similar policies. Public Health Actions: Use of PDMP data
      from individual states enables a more detailed examination of trends in opioid
      prescribing behaviors and indicators of possible misuse than is feasible with
      national commercially available prescription data. Comparison of opioid
      prescribing trends among states can be used to monitor the temporal association
      of national or state policy interventions and might help public health
      policymakers recognize changes in the use or possible misuse of controlled
      prescription drugs over time and allow for prompt intervention through amended or
      new opioid-related policies.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Opioid Cessation.
LID - 180
AB  - The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) and
      overdose-related deaths. However, the genetic basis for the ability to
      discontinue opioid use has not been investigated. We performed a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) of opioid cessation (defined as abstinence from illicit 
      opioids for >1 year or <6 months before the interview date) in 1130 African
      American (AA) and 2919 European ancestry (EA) participants recruited for genetic 
      studies of substance use disorders and who met lifetime Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for OUD.
      Association tests performed separately within each ethnic group were combined by 
      meta-analysis with results obtained from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study.
      Although there were no genome-wide significant associations, we found suggestive 
      associations with nine independent loci, including three which are biologically
      relevant: rs4740988 in PTPRD (pAA + EA = 2.24 × 10−6), rs36098404 in MYOM2 (pEA =
      2.24 × 10−6), and rs592026 in SNAP25-AS1 (pEA = 6.53 × 10−6). Significant
      pathways identified in persons of European ancestry (EA) are related to vitamin D
      metabolism (p = 3.79 × 10−2) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (p =
      2.39 × 10−2). UK Biobank traits including smoking and drinking cessation and
      chronic back pain were significantly associated with opioid cessation using
      GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores. These results provide evidence for genetic
      influences on opioid cessation, suggest genetic overlap with other relevant
      traits, and may indicate potential novel therapeutic targets for OUD.

LID - e200802
AB  - Question: Have emergency department clinicians responded to the opioid epidemic
      through altering opioid prescription rates? Findings: In this cross-sectional
      study of 556 176 emergency department patient encounters and 70 218 opioid
      prescriptions within a single emergency department, yearly prescriptions
      decreased by 66.3% between 2013 and 2018. This decrease was associated with a
      71.1% reduction in the number of opioid prescriptions for musculoskeletal pain
      (back, limb, joint, and neck pain) and lesser, but still marked, decreases for
      fractures and kidney stones. Meaning: Reductions in yearly opioid prescriptions
      across varying indications appear to be aligned with recognition of the opioid
      crisis in addition to national, state, and departmental education guidelines.

LID - e200274
AB  - Question: Are Medicare Part D formulary exclusions and restrictions for opioid
      alternatives associated with increases in opioid prescribing? Findings: Using
      county-level panel data throughout the United States, it was found that for each 
      additional opioid alternative not covered in a county, the rate of opioid
      prescribing increased by 2.2% to 3.7% relative to the mean opioid prescribing
      rate. Formulary restrictions in the form of utilization management strategies and
      high-cost tier placements for opioid alternatives were not associated with
      increases in opioid prescribing. Meaning: The findings of this study suggest that
      lack of coverage of opioid alternatives may encourage higher rates of opioid
      prescribing.

TI  - Knowledge, attitudes and practices of Canadian pediatric emergency physicians
      regarding short-term opioid use: a descriptive, cross-sectional survey.
PG  - E148-55
AB  - Background:: In the midst of the current opioid crisis, physicians are caught
      between balancing children’s optimal pain management and the risks of opioid
      therapy. This study describes pediatric emergency physicians’ practice patterns
      for prescribing, knowledge and attitudes regarding, and perceived barriers to and
      facilitators of short-term use of opioids. Methods:: We created a survey tool
      using published methodology guidelines and distributed it from October to
      December 2017 to all physicians in the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada
      database using Dillman’s tailored design method for mixed-mode surveys. We
      performed bivariable binomial logistic regressions to ascertain the effects of
      clinically significant variables (e.g., training, age, sex, degree of worry
      regarding severe adverse events) on use of opioids as a first-line treatment for 
      moderate pain in the emergency department, and prescription of opioids for
      moderate or severe pain for at-home use in children. Results:: Of the 224
      physicians in the database, 136 (60.7%) completed the survey (60/111 [54.1%]
      women; median age 44 yr). Of the 136, 74 (54.4%) had subspecialty training.
      Intranasally administered fentanyl was the most commonly selected opioid for
      first-line treatment of moderate (47 respondents [34.6%]) and severe (82 [60.3%])
      pain due to musculoskeletal injury. On a scale of 0 (not worried) to 100
      (extremely worried), physicians’ median score for worry regarding physical
      dependence was 6.0 (25th percentile 0.0, 75th percentile 16.0), for worry
      regarding addiction 10.0 (25th percentile 2.0, 75th percentile 20.0) and for
      worry regarding diversion of opioids 24.5 (25th percentile 14.0, 75th percentile 
      52.0). On a scale of 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely), the median score for
      influence of the opioid crisis on willingness to prescribe opioids was 22.0 (25th
      percentile 8.0, 75th percentile 49.0). The top 3 reported barriers to prescribing
      opioids were parental reluctance (57 [41.9%]), lack of clear guidelines for
      pediatric opioid use (35 [25.7%]) and concern about adverse effects (33 [24.3%]).
      Binomial logistic regression did not identify any statistically significant
      variables affecting use of opioids in the emergency department or prescribed for 
      use at home. Interpretation:: Emergency department physicians appeared minimally 
      concerned about physical dependence, addiction risk and the current opioid crisis
      when prescribing opioids to children. Evidence-based development of guidelines
      and protocols for use of opioids in children may improve physicians’ ability to
      manage pain in children responsibly and adequately.

TI  - PRESCRIPTION OPIOID MISUSE MOTIVE LATENT CLASSES: OUTCOMES FROM A NATIONALLY
      REPRESENTATIVE US SAMPLE.
PG  - e97
AB  - Aims:: Prescription opioid misuse (POM) contributes to a larger opioid crisis in 
      the US and Canada, with over 17,000 US POM-related overdose deaths in 2017. Our
      aims were to 1) identify specific profiles of respondents based on POM motives
      using the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and 2) compare
      profile respondents on sociodemographics, substance use and mental and physical
      health outcomes. Methods:: Analyses included 2017-18 NSDUH respondents with data 
      on POM motives (n= 4,810). POM was defined as prescription opioid use in a way
      not intended by the prescriber, including use without a prescription, in larger
      amounts or more frequently. Nine POM motives for the most recent episode were
      assessed, including “to relieve physical pain” and “to get high”. Latent classes,
      based on POM motives, were estimated. Classes were compared on sociodemographics,
      substance use, physical and mental health outcomes. Results:: Eight latent
      classes were identified (in order of prevalence): pain relief only, relax-pain
      relief, sleep-pain relief, multi-motive, high, experimenter, emotional coping,
      and dependent/hooked. Compared to the pain relief only group, the high and
      multi-motive classes had higher odds of all substance use outcomes, with the
      dependent/hooked class having higher odds on all but one outcome. Six of the
      eight classes had higher odds of past-year mental health treatment and suicidal
      ideation than the pain relief only class. Conclusions:: Screening for pain, pain 
      conditions, problematic substance use and psychopathology are recommended in
      those with any POM. While those in the dependent/hooked, multi-motive, and
      emotional coping classes are most likely to have prescription opioid use
      disorder, screening for opioid use disorder symptoms in all individuals with POM 
      is also warranted.

TI  - Adiponectin receptor 1 gene is potentially associated with severity of
      postoperative pain but not cancer pain.
LID - e18924
AB  - Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-derived cytokine that exerts its
      antiinflammatory effects by binding to 2 adiponectin receptors, adiponectin
      receptor 1 (ADIPOR1) and adiponectin receptor 2 (ADIPOR2). However, the role of
      these adiponectin receptors on inflammatory pain remains unclear. We investigated
      the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these genes and
      inflammatory pain, such as postoperative pain and cancer pain.We analyzed 17 SNPs
      of the ADIPOR1 gene and 27 SNPs of the ADIPOR2 gene in 56 adult patients with
      postlaparotomy pain. We compared these genotypes with pain intensity and opioid
      consumption, adjusting for multiple testing. We analyzed the genotypes of 88
      patients with cancer pain and examined the association of the relevant SNP(s)
      with pain intensity and opioid consumption.One variant of the ADIPOR1 gene
      (rs12045862) showed significant association with postoperative pain intensity;
      patients with minor allele homozygote (n = 7) demonstrated significantly worse
      pain intensity than that of combined patient group exhibiting major allele
      homozygote or the heterozygote (n = 49; Mann-Whitney test, P < .00002), although 
      their opioid consumptions were comparable. Cancer pain intensity between minor
      allele homozygote patients (n = 7) and other 2 genotype patients (n = 81) were
      comparable.The rs12045862 SNP of the ADIPOR1 gene was associated with
      postoperative pain but not cancer pain. This might result from functional
      alteration of the ADIPOR1 signalling pathways, which influence the inflammatory
      process. ADIPOR1 may be a novel potential target for developing analgesics of
      postoperative pain.

TI  - Sex Differences in Associations Between CYP2D6 Phenotypes and Response to Opioid 
      Analgesics.
PG  - 71-9
AB  - Background: Several small studies have previously investigated associations
      between the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolism and response to opioids. We
      used a large sample of patients to study associations between CYP2D6 phenotypes
      and estimated CYP2D6 enzymatic activity scores with pain control and adverse
      reactions related to codeine and tramadol use. We conducted additional analyses
      to determine whether our results were consistent among men and women. Methods: We
      used data from 2,877 participants in the RIGHT Protocol who were prescribed
      codeine and/or tramadol between 01/01/2005 and 12/31/2017 and who were not
      prescribed CYP2D6 inhibitors within 1 year prior to the opioid prescription.
      CYP2D6 phenotype categories were condensed into four groups: (1) Ultra-rapid and 
      Rapid (n = 61), (2) Normal and Intermediate to Normal (n = 1,448), (3)
      Intermediate and Intermediate to Poor (n = 1,175), and (4) Poor metabolizer
      status (n = 193). Opioid-related outcomes included indications of poor pain
      control or adverse reactions related to medication use. We modeled the risk of
      each outcome using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, race, and
      ethnicity. Results: The results revealed a trend from poor to ultra-rapid and
      rapid CYP2D6 phenotypes in which the risk of adverse reactions incrementally
      increased and the risk of poor pain control incrementally decreased. This trend
      reached statistical significance among female (but not male) participants. Among 
      normal and intermediate to normal metabolizers, a larger proportion of women
      experienced adverse reactions relative to men. Discussion: We replicated and
      extended the findings of previous research indicating associations between CYP2D6
      phenotypes and response to opioids. In addition, the observed associations were
      stronger in women than in men. We recommend sex differences to be factored in
      future research investigating associations between pharmacogenomics and response 
      to medications.

TI  - Regulator of G-Protein Signaling (RGS) Protein Modulation of Opioid Receptor
      Signaling as a Potential Target for Pain Management.
LID - 5
AB  - Opioid drugs are the gold standard for the management of pain, but their use is
      severely limited by dangerous and unpleasant side effects. All clinically
      available opioid analgesics bind to and activate the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), a 
      heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor, to produce analgesia. The activity of 
      these receptors is modulated by a family of intracellular RGS proteins or
      regulators of G-protein signaling proteins, characterized by the presence of a
      conserved RGS Homology (RH) domain. These proteins act as negative regulators of 
      G-protein signaling by serving as GTPase accelerating proteins or GAPS to switch 
      off signaling by both the Gα and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins.
      Consequently, knockdown or knockout of RGS protein activity enhances signaling
      downstream of MOR. In this review we discuss current knowledge of how this
      activity, across the different families of RGS proteins, modulates MOR activity, 
      as well as activity of other members of the opioid receptor family, and so pain
      and analgesia in animal models, with particular emphasis on RGS4 and RGS9
      families. We discuss inhibition of RGS proteins with small molecule inhibitors
      that bind to sensitive cysteine moieties in the RH domain and the potential for
      targeting this family of intracellular proteins as adjuncts to provide an opioid 
      sparing effect or as standalone analgesics by promoting the activity of
      endogenous opioid peptides. Overall, we conclude that RGS proteins may be a novel
      drug target to provide analgesia with reduced opioid-like side effects, but that 
      much basic work is needed to define the roles for specific RGS proteins,
      particularly in chronic pain, as well as a need to develop newer inhibitors.

TI  - G protein‐biased kratom‐alkaloids and synthetic carfentanil‐amide opioids as
      potential treatments for alcohol use disorder.
PG  - 1497-513
AB  - Background and Purpose: Mitragyna speciosa, more commonly known as kratom, is a
      plant that contains opioidergic alkaloids but is unregulated in most countries.
      Kratom is used in the self‐medication of chronic pain and to reduce illicit and
      prescription opioid dependence. Kratom may be less dangerous than typical opioids
      because of the stronger preference of kratom alkaloids to induce receptor
      interaction with G proteins over β‐arrestin proteins. We hypothesized that kratom
      (alkaloids) can also reduce alcohol intake. Experimental Approach: We
      pharmacologically characterized kratom extracts, kratom alkaloids (mitragynine,
      7‐hydroxymitragynine, paynantheine, and speciogynine) and synthetic
      carfentanil‐amide opioids for their ability to interact with G proteins and
      β‐arrestin at μ, δ, and κ opioid receptors in vitro. We used C57BL/6 mice to
      assess to which degree these opioids could reduce alcohol intake and whether they
      had rewarding properties. Key Results: Kratom alkaloids were strongly G
      protein‐biased at all three opioid receptors and reduced alcohol intake, but
      kratom and 7‐hydroxymitragynine were rewarding. Several results indicated a key
      role for δ opioid receptors, including that the synthetic carfentanil‐amide
      opioid MP102—a G protein‐biased agonist with modest selectivity for δ opioid
      receptors—reduced alcohol intake, whereas the G protein‐biased μ opioid agonist
      TRV130 did not. Conclusion and Implications: Our results suggest that kratom
      extracts can decrease alcohol intake but still carry significant risk upon
      prolonged use. Development of more δ opioid‐selective synthetic opioids may
      provide a safer option than kratom to treat alcohol use disorder with fewer side 
      effects.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Initiation of Strong Opioids in Cancer Patients on
      Palliative Care: An Audit from a Tertiary Cancer Center in India.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - Aim:: This audit was done to analyze the factors influencing the use of strong
      opioids in cancer patients receiving comprehensive palliative care from a
      tertiary institute. Materials and Methods:: Case records of patients registered
      for palliative care at our center in 3 months were retrospectively reviewed and
      followed up throughout the course of their illness. Demographic factors, prior
      treatments, social support system, analgesic use at registration, and use of
      radiation and adjuvant analgesics were recorded. Strong opioid use and their time
      of initiation were evaluated, and multivariate analysis was used to identify the 
      factors correlating with the above. Results:: After registration, strong opioids 
      were initiated in 16% of the patients. It was observed that patients younger than
      55 years and those with visceral metastases and history of use of weak opioids at
      the time of registration had a higher probability of being started on strong
      opioids. Factors associated with a significantly longer strong opioid-free
      interval were having spouse as primary caregiver, presence of skeletal
      metastases, use of palliative radiotherapy, and low socioeconomic status.
      Conclusion:: It is certain that the use of strong opioids for adequate analgesia 
      is a necessity for palliative-care patients. However, optimal utilization of
      adjunctive analgesic modalities, coupled with good supportive care, can minimize 
      the requirement and duration of strong opioid use, especially in developing
      countries with limited access to specialist palliative care.

TI  - The Use of Peripheral μ-Opioid Receptor Antagonists (PAMORA) in the Management of
      Opioid-Induced Constipation: An Update on Their Efficacy and Safety.
PG  - 1009-25
AB  - Peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) constitute a class of
      drugs which reverse opioid-induced constipation (OIC) with similar opioid
      analgesic effects. OIC differs from other forms of constipation in that it is an 
      iatrogenic condition that occurs when an opioid acts on the dense network of
      μ-opioid receptors in the enteric system, which affect a variety of functions
      including gastrointestinal motility, secretion, and other factors that can cause 
      bowel dysfunction. Unfortunately, laxative products, bowel regimens, dietary
      changes, and lifestyle modifications have limited effectiveness in preventing
      OIC, Opioid-associated adverse effect which occurs in 40% to 80% of opioid
      patients and may led to cessation of the treatment. PAMORAs are μ-receptor opioid
      antagonists specifically developed so that they have very limited ability to
      cross the blood-brain barrier and thus they are able to antagonize peripheral but
      not central μ-opioid receptors. PAMORAs are designed to have no effect on the
      analgesic benefits of opioid pain relievers but to relieve but antagonizing the
      effects of the opioid in the gastrointestinal system. The three main PAMORAS are 
      methyltrexone (oral or parenteral), naldemedine (oral only), and naloxegol (oral 
      only). Clinical studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these agents for
      alleviating constipation without diminishing the analgesic effect of opioid
      therapy. The aim of this narrative review to update the current status of PAMORAs
      for treating OIC in terms of safety and efficacy.

TI  - Women’s Perspectives On Provider Education Regarding Opioid Use.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - Objective: To elucidate women’s experiences with opioid medications and their
      perspectives on provider education regarding opioid use, risks and safety.
      Methods: Women with a self-reported history of pain who had been prescribed
      opioids were recruited in 2016 using a convenience sampling approach that
      included an online social media campaign. Participants (N=154) completed online
      surveys and open-ended questions regarding their experiences with pain and
      opioids, and their perspectives on the quality of education they received from
      their providers. Results: Participants reported receiving insufficient education 
      about opioid-related side effects, as reflected in both ratings for the quantity 
      and quality of education they received from their providers. Non-white
      participants reported lower quantity and poorer quality of provider education
      (p<0.05). Themes identified from the qualitative data included frustrations with 
      pain management options, fear of opioids, stigma associated with opioid use, and 
      the need for improved provider education and patient-provider communication.
      Conclusion: Findings suggest that from a patient’s perspective, there is a need
      for enhanced patient-provider communication and education regarding pain
      management and potential opioid-related side effects. Improved physician
      communication and education could promote shared decision-making and result in
      enhanced satisfaction with care and health outcomes.

      newest trend in acute and chronic pain pharmacotherapy.
LID - e1554
AB  - Opioids are the main group of pharmacological agents used during the
      perioperative period and provide a sedative and analgesic component. The
      observations of opioid consumption in West Europe indicate that this group of
      drugs is widely used in chronic noncancer pain therapy.Nearly 20 years ago, the
      first publications indicating that opioids, as an element of perioperative
      pharmacotherapy in oncologic patients, increase the risk of tumor recurrence and 
      affect further prognosis were presented. The actual publications suggest that
      there are multifactorial, complex mechanisms underlying the immunological impact 
      and carcinogenesis promotion of opioids and that the intensity varies depending
      on the type of opioid. There are also questions about the immunosuppressive
      effects among patients receiving opioids in the treatment of chronic noncancer
      pain.The aim of the review article is to present information about the action of 
      opioids on the immune system in carcinogenic settings and to define the clinical 
      usefulness of this pharmacological phenomenon.

TI  - The opioid mortality epidemic in North America: do we understand the supply side 
      dynamics of this unprecedented crisis?
LID - 14
AB  - While there has been extensive attention to the ‘demand side’ – or use and
      adverse consequences, including mortality – of the ‘opioid crisis’ presently
      unfolding across North America, few considerations have focused on the supply
      side. This paper examines the supply side dynamics of this unprecedented public
      health phenomenon. We provide evidence for several interrelated supply-side
      elements that have contributed to the present public health crisis. We observe
      that initially, persistently high levels of prescription opioid availability and 
      use exposed large proportions of the North American population to opioids,
      resulting in correspondingly high levels of medical and non-medical use (e.g.,
      involving diversion). While various intervention measures to control prescription
      opioid availability and use have been implemented in recent years, leading to
      eventual reductions in opioid dispensing levels, these occurred late in the
      crisis’s evolution. Moreover, these supply reductions have not been met by
      corresponding reductions in opioid use or demand levels. These growing
      discrepancies between opioid demand and prescription-based sources have left
      major gaps in opioid supplies. In response to such supply gaps, highly potent and
      toxic illicit opioid products have rapidly proliferated across North America, and
      become a core driver of the dramatic spikes in opioid overdose fatality levels in
      recent years. These supply-related interrelations are corroborated by a
      corresponding increase in illicit opioid-related fatalities, which arose just as 
      medical opioid supplies began to decrease in many jurisdictions. Improved
      analyses and understanding of the supply-side dynamics of the opioid crisis are
      urgently needed in order to inform future intervention and policy development.
      Meanwhile, the high mortality toll related to illicit, highly toxic opioid
      exposure requires sustained solutions, including supply-oriented measures (e.g., 
      safer opioid distribution for at–risk users) towards improved public health
      protection.

PG  - 152-7
AB  - The use of opioids in the perioperative period is associated with respiratory
      depression, impaired gastrointestinal function, post-operative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV), pruritus, urinary retention, delirium and the potential for
      developing opioid addiction. Currently the United States is experiencing an
      epidemic of prescription opioid abuse and deaths from overdose. Many addicts
      develop their addiction during a routine surgical admission to hospital. More
      people now die from overdose of synthetic prescription opioids than from heroin
      and other street drugs. Public education campaigns teaching family members of
      addicts to reverse opioid induced respiratory depression with naloxone are
      currently underway. Preventing the development of addiction in the first place
      during and after the surgical admission however will be more successful at saving
      lives. Primary prevention of opioid addiction is possible when non-opioid
      analgesic drugs are used. Employing alternative analgesic drugs in the
      peri-operative period that have a lower addiction potential and less respiratory 
      depression has therefore become a matter of great national importance. Many
      powerful non-opioid analgesics are currently available that have more favorable
      side effect profiles and a lower potential for developing addiction. However,
      these medications are currently not used as often in routine clinical practice as
      they should be. Replacing opioids with other analgesics will not only reduce the 
      development of opioid addiction but will also lead to better perioperative
      outcomes and enhanced patient recovery. This article briefly reviews the opioid
      alternatives that can significantly reduce or even entirely eliminate the
      perioperative use of opioids in the majority of surgical procedures.

      considerations: a qualitative study of the perspectives of Australian general
      practitioners.
LID - e034363
AB  - Objective: To explore the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) concerning 
      the risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations. Design: A qualitative approach using semistructured telephone
      interviews. Analysis used an integrative approach. Setting: Primary care.
      Participants: Australian GPs with experience of prescribing opioids for people
      with cancer and pain. Results: Twenty-two GPs participated, and three themes
      emerged. Theme 1 (Misuse is not the main problem) contextualised misuse as a
      relatively minor concern compared with pain control and toxicity, and highlighted
      underlying systemic factors, including limitations in continuity of care and
      doctor expertise. Theme 2 (‘A different mindset’ for cancer pain) captured
      participants’ relative comfort in prescribing opioids for pain in cancer versus
      non-cancer contexts, and acknowledgement that compassion and greater perceived
      community acceptance were driving factors, in addition to scientific support for 
      mechanisms and clinical efficacy. Participant attitudes towards prescribing for
      people with cancer versus non-cancer pain differed most when cancer was in the
      palliative phase, when they were unconcerned by misuse. Participants were
      equivocal about the risk–benefit ratio of long-term opioid therapy in the chronic
      phase of cancer, and were reluctant to prescribe for disease-free survivors.
      Theme 3 (‘The question is always, ‘how lazy have you been?’) captured
      participants’ acknowledgement that they sometimes prescribed opioids for cancer
      pain as a default, easier option compared with more holistic pain management.
      Conclusions: Findings highlight the role of specific clinical considerations in
      distinguishing risk of opioid misuse in the cancer versus non-cancer population, 
      rather than diagnosis per se. Further efforts are needed to ensure continuity of 
      care where opioid prescribing is shared. Greater evidence is needed to guide
      opioid prescribing in disease-free survivors and the chronic phase of cancer,
      especially in the context of new treatments for metastatic disease.

LID - e52694
AB  - The rates of opioid overdose in the United States quadrupled between 1999 and
      2017, reaching a staggering 130 deaths per day. This health epidemic demands
      innovative solutions that require uncovering the key brain areas and cell types
      mediating the cause of overdose— opioid-induced respiratory depression. Here, we 
      identify two primary changes to murine breathing after administering opioids.
      These changes implicate the brainstem’s breathing circuitry which we confirm by
      locally eliminating the µ-Opioid receptor. We find the critical brain site is the
      preBötzinger Complex, where the breathing rhythm originates, and use genetic
      tools to reveal that just 70–140 neurons in this region are responsible for its
      sensitivity to opioids. Future characterization of these neurons may lead to
      novel therapies that prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.

      Findings from the Mortality Disparities in American Communities Study (MDAC).
LID - e0227966
AB  - Background: Understanding relationships between individual-level demographic,
      socioeconomic status (SES) and U.S. opioid fatalities can inform interventions in
      response to this crisis. Methods: The Mortality Disparities in American Community
      Study (MDAC) links nearly 4 million 2008 American Community Survey responses to
      the 2008–2015 National Death Index. Univariate and multivariable models were used
      to estimate opioid overdose fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). Results: Opioid overdose was an overrepresented cause of death
      among people 10 to 59 years of age. In multivariable analysis, compared to
      Hispanics, Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives had elevated risk (HR =
      2.52, CI:2.21–2.88) and (HR = 1.88, CI:1.35–2.62), respectively. Compared to
      women, men were at-risk (HR = 1.61, CI:1.50–1.72). People who were disabled were 
      at higher risk than those who were not (HR = 2.80, CI:2.59–3.03). Risk was higher
      among widowed than married (HR = 2.44, CI:2.03–2.95) and unemployed than employed
      individuals (HR = 2.46, CI:2.17–2.79). Compared to adults with graduate degrees, 
      those with high school only were at-risk (HR = 2.48, CI:2.00–3.06). Citizens were
      more likely than noncitizens to die from this cause (HR = 4.62, CI:3.48–6.14).
      Compared to people who owned homes with mortgages, those who rented had higher
      HRs (HR = 1.36, CI:1.25–1.48). Non-rural residents had higher risk than rural
      residents (HR = 1.46, CI:1.34, 1.59). Compared to respective referent groups,
      people without health insurance (HR = 1.30, CI:1.20–1.41) and people who were
      incarcerated were more likely to die from opioid overdoses (HR = 2.70,
      CI:1.91–3.81). Compared to people living in households at least five-times above 
      the poverty line, people who lived in poverty were more likely to die from this
      cause (HR = 1.36, CI:1.20–1.54). Compared to people living in West North Central 
      states, HRs were highest among those in South Atlantic (HR = 1.29, CI:1.11, 1.50)
      and Mountain states (HR = 1.58, CI:1.33, 1.88). Discussion: Opioid fatality was
      associated with indicators of low SES. The findings may help to target
      prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts to vulnerable groups.

TI  - The Use of Opioids and Antipsychotics in Elderly with Dementia – Have Opioids
      Replaced Antipsychotics in Treating Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia?
PG  - 259-67
AB  - Background:: Opioids are used with increasing frequency. Elderly with dementia
      are prescribed opioids more frequent than elderly without. One possible
      explanation is that opioids may be used not only to treat pain but also
      behavioral symptoms. Objective:: To test the hypothesis that strong opioid use,
      especially transdermal formulations, had increased, especially in elderly with
      dementia, in parallel with a decrease in antipsychotic use. Methods::
      Population-based cross-sectional study conducted using nationwide Danish
      registers with data on Denmark’s entire elderly population age ≥65 (2000:
      n = 802,106; 2015: n = 1,056,476). The registers were used to identify elderly
      with and without dementia and filled prescriptions for opioids and
      antipsychotics. Annual prevalence of opioid and antipsychotic use from 2000–2015 
      was calculated. Results:: Prevalence of opioid use increased by 35% (24.2 to
      32.5%) among elderly with dementia and by 13% among elderly without (14.9 to
      16.8%) from 2000–2015. The disproportionate increase in opioid use among elderly 
      with dementia was mainly driven by an increase in strong opioids (dementia: 11.7 
      to 23.1%; without dementia: 5.9 to 7.4%). Use of antipsychotics decreased during 
      the same period (dementia: 31.3 to 19.3%; no dementia: 4.5 to 2.7%). Conclusion::
      From 2000–2015, use of opioids among the elderly increased with a
      disproportionately higher increase among elderly with dementia. The parallel
      decrease in the use of antipsychotics may suggest that opioids to some extent
      have replaced antipsychotics in managing behavioral symptoms, despite safety
      concerns and lack of evidence for effect of opioids. Future research should focus
      on potential risks associated with increased opioid use.

TI  - Opioid versus opioid-free analgesia after surgical discharge: protocol for a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - e035443
AB  - Introduction: Excessive prescribing after surgery has contributed to a public
      health crisis of opioid addiction and overdose in North America. However, the
      value of prescribing opioids to manage postoperative pain after surgical
      discharge remains unclear. We propose a systematic review and meta-analysis to
      assess the extent to which opioid analgesia impact postoperative pain intensity
      and adverse events in comparison to opioid-free analgesia in patients discharged 
      after surgery. Methods and analysis: Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase,
      Cochrane Library, Scopus, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL and PsycINFO) will be searched for
      multi-dose randomised-trials examining the comparative effectiveness of opioid
      versus opioid-free analgesia after surgical discharge. Studies published from
      January 1990 to July 2019 will be targeted, with no language restrictions. The
      search will be re-run before manuscript submission to include most recent
      literature. We will consider studies involving patients undergoing minor and
      major surgery. Teams of reviewers will, independently and in duplicate, assess
      eligibility, extract data and evaluate risk of bias. Our main outcomes of
      interest are pain intensity and postoperative vomiting. Study results will be
      pooled using random effects models. When trials report outcomes for a common
      domain (eg, pain intensity) using different scales, we will convert effect sizes 
      to a common standard metric (eg, Visual Analogue Scale). Minimally important
      clinical differences reported in previous literature will be considered when
      interpreting results. Subgroup analyses defined a priori will be conducted to
      explore heterogeneity. Risk of bias will be assessed according to the Cochrane
      Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. The quality of evidence for all outcomes
      will be evaluated using the GRADE rating system. Ethics and dissemination:
      Ethical approval is not required since this is a systematic review of published
      studies. Our results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented
      at relevant conferences. Further knowledge dissemination will be sought via
      public and patient organisations focussed on pain and opioid-related harms.

TI  - The Complex Balance between Analgesic Efficacy, Change of Dose and Safety Profile
      Over Time, in Cancer Patients Treated with Opioids: Providing the Clinicians with
      an Evaluation Tool.
LID - 502
AB  - Background: Scanty data exist on the integration between the analgesic effect of 
      opioids, dose changes, and adverse events in cancer patients. Methods: To provide
      further information on this issue, we analysed data on 498 advanced-stage cancer 
      patients treated with strong opioids. At baseline and three visits (at days 7,
      14, and 21), pain intensity, oral morphine-equivalent daily dose, and the
      prevalence of major adverse events were measured. The proportion of responders
      (pain intensity decrease ≥30% from baseline) and non-responders, as well as of
      patients with low or high dose escalation, was calculated. Results: Pain
      intensity strongly decreased from baseline (pain intensity difference −4.0 at day
      7 and −4.2 at day 21) in responders, while it was quite stable in non-responders 
      (pain intensity difference −0.8 at day 7 and −0.9 at day 21). In low dose
      escalation patients (82.4% at final visit), daily dose changed from 52.3 to 65.3 
      mg; in high dose escalation patients (17.6%), it varied from 94.1 to 146.7 mg.
      Among responders, high dose escalation patients experienced significantly more
      frequent adverse events compared to low or high dose escalation patients, while
      no differences were observed in non-responders. Conclusions: The response to
      opioids results from the combination of three clinical aspects, which are
      strongly interrelated. These results provide some thoughts to help clinical
      evaluations and therapeutic decisions regarding opioid use.

TI  - Investigating opioid-related fatalities in southern Sweden: contact with
      care-providing authorities and comparison of substances.
LID - 5
AB  - Background: Opioid-related deaths have increased in Western countries over recent
      decades. Despite numerous studies investigating opioid-related mortality, only a 
      few have focused on the lives of the deceased individuals prior to their deaths, 
      specifically regarding contact with care-providing authorities such as health,
      social and correctional services. Furthermore, a change has been noted in the
      last two decades as to which opioids cause most deaths, from heroin to
      prescription opioids. However, studies comparing fatalities caused by different
      substances are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate contact with
      care-providing authorities during the year prior to death among individuals who
      died as a result of opioid intoxication and to analyse differences relating to
      which opioids caused their deaths. Methods: The study is based on retrospective
      register data and includes 180 individuals with a history of illicit drug use,
      who died from opioid intoxication in Skåne, Sweden, between 1 January 2012 to 31 
      December 2013 and 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. Intoxications caused by heroin,
      methadone, buprenorphine and fentanyl were included. Data were collected from the
      National Board of Forensic Medicine, regional health care services, municipal
      social services and the Prison and Probation Service. Statistical testing was
      performed using Pearson’s chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test and the
      Mann-Whitney U test to analyse group differences. Results: A total of 89% of the 
      deceased individuals had been in contact with one or more of the care-providing
      authorities during the year prior to death; 75% had been in contact with health
      care, 69% with the social services, 28% with the Prison and Probation Service,
      and 23% had been enrolled in opioid substitution treatment at some point during
      their final year of life. Few differences appeared between the substance groups
      with regard to which opioid contributed to the death. In addition to opioids,
      sedatives were present in more than 80% of the cases. Individuals whose deaths
      were buprenorphine-related had been in contact with the social services to a
      significantly lesser extent during the year prior to death. Conclusions: The
      studied population is characterised by extensive contact with care-providing
      authorities, thus providing numerous opportunities for authorities to reach this 
      group with preventive and other interventions. Few differences emerged between
      groups with regard to which opioid had contributed to the death.

TI  - Prescription Drug Misuse: Taking a Lifespan Perspective.
LID - 1178221820909352
AB  - Prescription drug misuse (PDM), or medication use without a prescription or in
      ways not intended by the prescriber, is a notable public health concern,
      especially in the United States. Accumulating research has characterized PDM
      prevalence and processes, but age-based or lifespan changes in PDM are
      understudied. Given age-based differences in the medical or developmental
      concerns that often underlie PDM, it is likely that PDM varies by age. This
      review summarizes the literature on PDM across the lifespan, examining lifespan
      changes in prevalence, sources, motives and correlates for opioid, stimulant, and
      tranquilizer/sedative (or benzodiazepine) PDM. In all, prevalence rates, sources 
      and motives vary considerably by age group, with fewer age-based differences in
      correlates or risk factors. PDM prevalence rates tend to decline with aging, with
      greater use of physician sources and greater endorsement of self-treatment
      motives in older groups. Recreational motives (such as to get high) tend to peak 
      in young adulthood, with greater use of peer sources or purchases to obtain
      medication for PDM in younger groups. PDM co-occurs with other substance use and 
      psychopathology, including suicidality, across age groups. The evidence for
      lifespan variation in PDM is strongest for opioid PDM, with a need for more
      research on tranquilizer/sedative and stimulant PDM. The current literature is
      limited by the few studies of lifespan changes in PDM within a single sample, a
      lack of longitudinal research, little research addressing PDM in the context of
      polysubstance use, and little research on minority groups, such as sexual and
      gender minorities.

TI  - Safety and Efficacy of Naldemedine for the Treatment of Opioid-Induced
      Constipation in Patients with Chronic Non-Cancer Pain Receiving Opioid Therapy: A
      Subgroup Analysis of Patients ≥ 65 Years of Age.
PG  - 271-9
AB  - Background: Opioid-induced constipation (OIC), the most common side effect of
      opioid treatment, is under-recognized and undertreated in older patients.
      Naldemedine, an oral, peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA), 
      is approved in Japan, the United States, and the European Union for treatment of 
      OIC in adult patients. Objective: This integrated analysis of three phase 3
      trials (COMPOSE-1, COMPOSE-2, and COMPOSE-3) evaluated the safety and efficacy of
      naldemedine for up to 12 weeks in a subgroup of patients aged ≥ 65 years.
      Methods: Patients aged 18–80 years with chronic non-cancer pain for ≥ 3 months
      (treated with opioids for ≥ 3 months in COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2) and OIC received
      oral naldemedine 0.2 mg or placebo once daily. Safety assessments included
      overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs in the
      gastrointestinal disorders System Organ Class, and TEAEs of opioid withdrawal or 
      possible opioid withdrawal. Efficacy was based on the proportion of responders in
      COMPOSE-1 and COMPOSE-2, defined as having ≥ 3 spontaneous bowel movements/week
      and a ≥ 1-spontaneous bowel movement/week increase from baseline for ≥ 9 of
      12 weeks and ≥ 3 of the last 4 weeks. Results: A total of 14.8% (344/2328) of
      patients were aged ≥ 65 years in all studies. The incidence of TEAEs in
      naldemedine-treated patients aged ≥ 65 years (45.9%) was comparable to that in
      patients aged ≥ 65 years receiving placebo (51.6%) and in the overall naldemedine
      group (47.1%). The incidence of gastrointestinal disorders System Organ Class
      TEAEs in naldemedine-treated patients aged ≥ 65 years (20.2%) was also comparable
      to that in patients aged ≥ 65 years receiving placebo (16.1%) and in the overall 
      naldemedine group (21.8%). The incidence of TEAEs of opioid withdrawal with
      naldemedine was 1.1% in patients aged ≥ 65 years and 1.0% overall, and the
      incidence of TEAEs of possible opioid withdrawal was 1.1% in patients
      aged ≥ 65 years and 1.7% overall. The proportion of responders was higher in
      naldemedine-treated patients versus placebo, both overall (50.1% vs 34.1%;
      p < 0.0001) and in those aged ≥ 65 years (51.8% vs 37.6%). Conclusions: This
      integrated analysis confirmed that OIC treatment with naldemedine 0.2 mg was
      generally well tolerated and effective in patients aged ≥ 65 years with chronic
      non-cancer pain. Safety and efficacy results were consistent with the overall
      patient population. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT01965158, NCT01993940,

TI  - Evaluating kratom alkaloids using PHASE.
LID - e0229646
AB  - Kratom is a botanical substance that is marketed and promoted in the US for
      pharmaceutical opioid indications despite having no US Food and Drug
      Administration approved uses. Kratom contains over forty alkaloids including two 
      partial agonists at the mu opioid receptor, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine,
      that have been subjected to the FDA’s scientific and medical evaluation. However,
      pharmacological and toxicological data for the remaining alkaloids are limited.
      Therefore, we applied the Public Health Assessment via Structural Evaluation
      (PHASE) protocol to generate in silico binding profiles for 25 kratom alkaloids
      to facilitate the risk evaluation of kratom. PHASE demonstrates that kratom
      alkaloids share structural features with controlled opioids, indicates that
      several alkaloids bind to the opioid, adrenergic, and serotonin receptors, and
      suggests that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are the strongest binders at
      the mu opioid receptor. Subsequently, the in silico binding profiles of a subset 
      of the alkaloids were experimentally verified at the opioid, adrenergic, and
      serotonin receptors using radioligand binding assays. The verified binding
      profiles demonstrate the ability of PHASE to identify potential safety signals
      and provide a tool for prioritizing experimental evaluation of high-risk
      compounds.

TI  - Predicting high-risk opioid prescriptions before they are given.
PG  - 1917-23
AB  - We describe a hypothetical preventative policy solution to address the opioid
      crisis using an integrated administrative database developed in collaboration
      with the State of Rhode Island. Machine learning algorithms trained on
      observations of past opioid prescription accurately predict adverse
      opioid-related outcomes among Medicaid recipients even before their initial
      opioid prescription is written. Although these models are limited to individuals 
      who have been selected for opioid prescription, they suggest a feasible path
      forward for using administrative data to inform prescription risk. Under the
      assumption that the cost of diverting individuals from opioid therapy to an
      alternative therapy is homogenous across individuals, we simulate a hypothetical 
      policy for restricting opioid prescriptions based on risk that is likely
      net-beneficial given current cost estimates.

TI  - Opioid drug use in emergency and adverse outcomes among patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease: a multicenter observational study.
LID - 5038
AB  - There is still debate as to the safety of non-palliative opioid administration to
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients punctually treated for an
      acute complaint. All patients over 40 presenting at two university hospital
      emergency departments (Montréal Qc, Grenoble Fr) from March 2008 to September
      2014 with dyspnea, abdominal pain or trauma were retrieved, and COPD patients
      were selected. Our primary endpoint was a composite criterion including invasive 
      ventilation and death. Comparisons between visits in which opioid drugs were
      prescribed and those without opioids were performed using an inverse probability 
      of treatment and censoring weight (IPTCW) estimator to adjust for baseline
      confounders. A survival weighted Cox model was used. 7799 visits by COPD patients
      were identified, corresponding to 4173 unique patients. Opioid drug prescription 
      was reported in 1317 (16.9%) visits. After applying IPCTW weighting, opioid
      prescription was found to be associated with the composite criterion of poor
      clinical outcomes (HR = 4.73 (2.94; 7.61), p < 0.01). When taken separately, this
      association remained significant for invasive ventilation and death, but not for 
      NIV. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the association, except for patients with
      trauma or abdominal pain as the main complaint. This excess risk is observed
      whatever the route of administration.

TI  - Developing a clinical decision support for opioid use disorders: a NIDA center
      for the clinical trials network working group report.
LID - 4
AB  - There is an urgent need for strategies to address the US epidemic of prescription
      opioid, heroin and fentanyl-related overdoses, misuse, addiction, and diversion. 
      Evidence-based treatment such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are
      available but lack numbers of providers offering these services to meet the
      demands. Availability of electronic health record (EHR) systems has greatly
      increased and led to innovative quality improvement initiatives but this has not 
      yet been optimized to address the opioid epidemic or to treat opioid use disorder
      (OUD). This report from a clinical decision support (CDS) working group convened 
      by the NIDA Center for the Clinical Trials Network aims to converge electronic
      technology in the EHR with the urgent need to improve screening, identification, 
      and treatment of OUD in primary care settings through the development of a CDS
      algorithm that could be implemented as a tool in the EHR. This aim is consistent 
      with federal, state and local government and private sector efforts to improve
      access and quality of MOUD treatment for OUD, existing clinical quality and HEDIS
      measures for OUD or drug and alcohol use disorders, and with a recent draft grade
      B recommendation from the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) for
      screening for illicit drug use in adults when appropriate diagnosis, treatment
      and care services can be offered or referred. Through a face-to-face expert panel
      meeting and multiple follow-up conference calls, the working group drafted CDS
      algorithms for clinical care felt to be essential for screening, diagnosis, and
      management of OUD in primary care. The CDS algorithm was reviewed by addiction
      specialists and primary care providers and revised based on their input. A
      clinical decision support tool for OUD screening, assessment, and treatment
      within primary care systems may help improve healthcare delivery to help address 
      the current epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose that has outpaced the capacity
      of specialized treatment settings. A semi-structured outline of clinical decision
      support for OUD was developed to facilitate implementation within the EHR.
      Further work for adaptation at specific sites and for testing is needed.

TI  - Social media as an emerging tool for reducing prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors.
LID - e03471
AB  - Interventions are urgently needed to reduce prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors, including anxiety and concomitant use of sedatives. However, only a
      limited number of randomized controlled opioid intervention trials have been
      conducted. We sought to determine whether an online behavior change/support
      community, compared to a control Facebook group, could reduce anxiety and opioid 
      misuse among chronic pain patients. 51 high-risk non-cancer chronic pain patients
      were randomly assigned to either a Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE)
      peer-led online behavior change intervention or a control group (no peer leaders)
      on Facebook for 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria were: 18 years or older, a UCLA
      Health System patient, prescribed an opioid for non-cancer chronic pain between 3
      and 12 months ago, and a score of ≥9 on the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) 
      and/or concomitant use of benzodiazepines. Participation in the online community 
      was voluntary. Patients completed baseline and follow-up assessments on
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder screener (GAD-7), COMM, and frequency of social
      media discussions about pain and opioid use. Compared to control group
      participants, intervention participants showed a baseline-to-follow-up decrease
      in anxiety, and more frequently used social media to discuss pain, prescription
      opioid use, coping strategies, places to seek help, and alternative therapies for
      pain. Both groups showed a baseline to follow-up decrease in COMM score.
      Preliminary results support the use an online community interventions as a
      low-cost tool to decrease risk for prescription opioid misuse and its
      complications.

TI  - Prevention and management of diarrhea associated with naldemedine among patients 
      receiving opioids: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 25
AB  - Background: Naldemedine, a novel peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor
      antagonist, has improved opioid-induced constipation in randomized controlled
      trials. The most frequent adverse event of naldemedine is diarrhea, which can
      cause abdominal pain and often leads to treatment discontinuation. We aimed to
      identify risk factors and appropriate management strategies for key adverse
      events including diarrhea associated with naldemedine, since those have not been 
      extensively studied. Methods: We conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort
      study. Eligible patients had cancer, had undergone palliative care at
      participating centers, had been prescribed regular opioids, and had taken at
      least one dose of naldemedine between June 2017 and March 2018. The primary
      endpoint was the incidence of diarrhea according to baseline characteristics.
      Secondary endpoints included the duration of naldemedine administration, daily
      defecation counts before and after starting naldemedine, duration and severity of
      diarrhea as an adverse event of naldemedine, other adverse events, and the
      incidence of constipation within 7 days after recovery from diarrhea. We defined 
      patients who started naldemedine within three days of starting a regularly
      prescribed opioid as the early group, and the remainder as the late group.
      Results: Among 103 patients who received naldemedine, 98 fulfilled the
      eligibility criteria. The median age was 68 years and 48% of the patients were
      female. Median performance status was 3, and the median oral intake was 50%. The 
      median duration of naldemedine administration and overall survival were 25 and
      64 days, respectively. The incidence of diarrhea in the early group (n = 26) was 
      significantly lower than in the late group (n = 72) (3.9% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.02).
      Daily defecation counts increased after late (median 0.43 to 0.88, p < 0.001),
      but remained stable after early naldemedine administration (median 1.00 to 1.00, 
      p = 0.34). Constipation after the diarrhea was resolved was common (53%),
      especially among patients who stopped naldemedine (78%). The diarrhea was
      improved within three days in 92% of patients who stopped other laxatives.
      Conclusions: The early administration of naldemedine is beneficial because it
      reduces adverse events including diarrhea. Diarrhea caused by naldemedine can be 
      effectively managed by stopping other laxatives while continuing naldemedine.

TI  - Canadian Guidelines on Opioid Use Disorder Among Older Adults.
PG  - 123-34
AB  - Background: In Canada, rates of hospital admission from opioid overdose are
      higher for older adults (≥ 65) than younger adults, and opioid use disorder (OUD)
      is a growing concern. In response, Health Canada commissioned the Canadian
      Coalition of Seniors’ Mental Health to create guidelines for the prevention,
      screening, assessment, and treatment of OUD in older adults. Methods: A
      systematic review of English language literature from 2008–2018 regarding OUD in 
      adults was conducted. Previously published guidelines were evaluated using AGREE 
      II, and key guidelines updated using ADAPTE method, by drawing on current
      literature. Recommendations were created and assessed using the GRADE method.
      Results: Thirty-two recommendations were created. Prevention recommendations: it 
      is key to prioritize non-pharmacological and non-opioid strategies to treat acute
      and chronic noncancer pain. Assessment recommendations: a comprehensive
      assessment is important to help discern contributions of other medical
      conditions. Treatment recommendations: buprenorphine is first line for both
      withdrawal management and maintenance therapy, while methadone, slow-release oral
      morphine, or naltrexone can be used as alternatives under certain circumstances; 
      non-pharmacological treatments should be offered as an integrated part of care.
      Conclusion: These guidelines provide practical and timely clinical
      recommendations on the prevention, assessment, and treatment of OUD in older
      adults within the Canadian context.

TI  - Computed tomography-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection for refractory
      pain in patients with spinal metastases: Two case reports.
LID - e18939
AB  - Rationale:: Diagnosing and treating refractory cancer pain have become
      standardized and effective procedures with guidance from the Expert Consensus on 
      Refractory Cancer Pain released in 2017 by the Committee of Rehabilitation and
      Palliative Care of China. Doxorubicin has been used for perineural injection in
      the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain owing to its retrograde sensory ganglion
      resection effect. Our study reports a new fourth-ladder treatment for cancer
      pain: CT-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection for patients with refractory 
      cancer pain caused by paraspinal metastasis. Patient concerns:: A 48-year-old
      female and a 47-year-old male patients suffered from refractory cancer pain over 
      the past months. They had both undergone surgical tumor resection, chemotherapy, 
      and precision radiotherapy but result in limited analgesic effect. The daily oral
      morphine dosage was around 60 to 100 mg and rescue analgesic methods had been
      used at the time. Diagnoses:: Refractory cancer pain in 2 patients with renal
      cancer and hepatobiliary adenocarcinoma. Interventions:: The patients both
      received computed tomography (CT)-guided 1 mL of 0.5% doxorubicin paravertebral
      injection at each affected nerve root segments. Outcomes:: The Visual Analog
      Scale and Douleur Neuropathique four Questions were used for 6-month follow-up,
      and the analgesic requirement was also recorded. The patients enjoyed
      satisfactory analgesia for up to 6 months without adverse reaction. In addition, 
      the oral opioid analgesic doses were significantly reduced after the neurolytic
      block. Lessons:: The CT-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection was an
      effective fourth-step analgesic interventional technology that allowed our 2
      patients with refractory cancer pain to maintain satisfactory analgesia. This
      analgesia method taken at an appropriate stage, according to the latest analgesic
      concept, results in good analgesia and opioid use reduction. Also, with the
      imaging guidance, only a small amount of neurolytic agent is needed to achieve
      analgesia in a precise and safe way.

TI  - Chronic pain diagnoses and opioid dispensings among insured individuals with
      serious mental illness.
LID - 40
AB  - Background: Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder
      (BD) have particularly high rates of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) and are also 
      more likely to receive prescription opioids for their pain. However, there have
      been no known studies published to date that have examined opioid treatment
      patterns among individuals with schizophrenia. Methods: Using electronic medical 
      record data across 13 Mental Health Research Network sites, individuals with
      diagnoses of MDD (N = 65,750), BD (N = 38,117) or schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder (N = 12,916) were identified and matched on age, sex and
      Medicare status to controls with no documented mental illness. CNCP diagnoses and
      prescription opioid medication dispensings were extracted for the matched
      samples. Multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate (1) the odds of
      receiving a pain-related diagnosis and (2) the odds of receiving opioids, by
      separate mental illness diagnosis category compared with matched controls,
      controlling for age, sex, Medicare status, race/ethnicity, income, medical
      comorbidities, healthcare utilization and chronic pain diagnoses. Results:
      Multivariable models indicated that having a MDD (OR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.85–1.95) 
      or BD (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.66–1.77) diagnosis was associated with increased
      odds of a CNCP diagnosis after controlling for age, sex, race, income, medical
      comorbidities and healthcare utilization. By contrast, having a schizophrenia
      diagnosis was associated with decreased odds of receiving a chronic pain
      diagnosis (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.82–0.90). Having a MDD (OR = 2.59; 95%
      CI = 2.44–2.75) or BD (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.97–2.28) diagnosis was associated
      with increased odds of receiving chronic opioid medications, even after
      controlling for age, sex, race, income, medical comorbidities, healthcare
      utilization and chronic pain diagnosis; having a schizophrenia diagnosis was not 
      associated with receiving chronic opioid medications. Conclusions: Individuals
      with serious mental illness, who are most at risk for developing opioid-related
      problems, continue to be prescribed opioids more often than their peers without
      mental illness. Mental health clinicians may be particularly well-suited to lead 
      pain assessment and management efforts for these patients. Future research is
      needed to evaluate the effectiveness of involving mental health clinicians in
      these efforts.

TI  - Identification of genetic polymorphisms modulating nausea and vomiting in two
      series of opioid-treated cancer patients.
LID - 542
AB  - Nausea and vomiting are often associated with opioid analgesia in cancer
      patients; however, only a subset of patients develop such side effects. Here, we 
      tested the hypothesis that the occurrence of nausea and vomiting is modulated by 
      the genetic background of the patients. Whole exome sequencing of DNA pools from 
      patients with either low (n = 937) or high (n = 557) nausea and vomiting
      intensity, recruited in the European Pharmacogenetic Opioid Study, revealed a
      preliminary association of 53 polymorphisms. PCR-based genotyping of 45 of these 
      polymorphisms in the individual patients of the same series confirmed the
      association for six SNPs in AIM1L, CLCC1, MUC16, PDE3A, POM121L2, and ZNF165
      genes. Genotyping of the same 45 polymorphisms in 264 patients of the Italian
      CERP study, also treated with opioids for cancer pain, instead confirmed the
      association for two SNPs in ZNF568 and PDE3A genes. Only one SNP, rs12305038 in
      PDE3A, was confirmed in both series, although with opposite effects of the minor 
      allele on the investigated phenotype. Overall, our findings suggest that genetic 
      factors are indeed associated with nausea and vomiting in opioid-treated cancer
      patients, but the role of individual polymorphisms may be weak.

TI  - Oxycodone preemptive analgesia after endoscopic plasma total adenotonsillectomy
      in children: A randomized controlled trial.
LID - e19004
AB  - Background:: Endoscopic tonsillectomy is associated with postoperative pain.
      Postoperative pain management remains to be improved in children. We aimed to
      investigate oxycodone preemptive analgesia in children undergoing endoscopic
      plasma total adenotonsillectomy. Methods:: 166 children with adenotonsillar
      hypertrophy were recruited at Wuhan Children's Hospital between 08/2016 and
      03/2017. They were randomly assigned to receive SPOA (postoperative sufentanil), 
      SPEA+SPOA (preemptive sufentanil and postoperative sufentanil), and OPEA+SPOA
      (preemptive oxycodone and postoperative sufentanil). The primary endpoint was
      serum c-fos levels. The secondary endpoints were the response entropy (RE) value,
      Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score, FLACC score, and adverse
      events. Results:: c-fos mRNA levels were increased significantly after surgery in
      the SPOA and SPEA+SPOA groups (P < .05). Postoperatively, c-fos mRNA levels were 
      higher in the SPOA group compared with the OPEA+SPOA group (P = .044). The RE
      values increased in all groups after surgery (P < .05). At extubation, RE values 
      were higher in the SPOA group compared with the SPEA+SPOA and OPEA+SPOA groups
      (P < .05). The PAED scores were higher in the SPOA group compared with the
      OPEA+SPOA group (P = .045). In the SPOA group, the FLACC scores were decreased at
      24 h after surgery vs 4 hours (P = .044). Prediction probability (Pk) values
      indicated that RE and c-fos mRNA levels were quantitative predictors for early
      postoperative stress reaction after surgery. Conclusions:: The subanalgesic dose 
      of oxycodone (0.1 mg/kg) as preemptive analgesia could improve pain after
      endoscopic plasma total adenotonsillectomy in children.

TI  - Bidirectional Regulation of Opioid and Chemokine Function.
LID - 94
AB  - The opioid family of GPCRs consists of the classical opioid receptors, designated
      μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors, and the orphanin-FQ receptor, and these proteins 
      are expressed on both neuronal and hematopoietic cells. A number of laboratories 
      have reported that an important degree of cross-talk can occur between the opioid
      receptors and the chemokine and chemokine receptor families. As a part of this,
      the opioid receptors are known to regulate the expression of certain chemokines
      and chemokine receptors, including those that possess strong pro-inflammatory
      activity. At the level of receptor function, it is clear that certain members of 
      the chemokine family can mediate cross-desensitization of the opioid receptors.
      Conversely, the opioid receptors are all able to induce heterologous
      desensitization of some of the chemokine receptors. Consequently, activation of
      one or more of the opioid receptors can selectively cross-desensitize chemokine
      receptors and regulate chemokine function. These cross-talk processes have
      significant implications for the inflammatory response, since the regulation of
      both the recruitment of inflammatory cells, as well as the sensation of pain, can
      be controlled in this way.

TI  - Drivers of the opioid crisis: An appraisal of financial conflicts of interest in 
      clinical practice guideline panels at the peak of opioid prescribing.
LID - e0227045
AB  - Background: Starting in the late 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry sought to
      increase prescribing of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Influencing the
      content of clinical practice guidelines may have been one strategy industry
      employed. In this study we assessed potential risk of bias from financial
      conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry in guidelines for opioid
      prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain published between 2007 and 2013, the peak
      of opioid prescribing. Methods: We used the Guideline Panel Review (GPR) to
      appraise the guidelines included in the 2014 systematic review and critical
      appraisal by Nuckols et al. These were English language opioid prescribing
      guidelines for adults with chronic non-cancer pain published between July 2007
      and July 2013, the peak of opioid prescribing. The GPR assigns red flags to items
      known to introduce potential bias from financial conflicts of interest. We
      operationalized the GPR by creating specific definitions for each red flag. Two
      reviewers independently evaluated each guideline. Disagreements were resolved
      with discussion. We also compared our score to the critical appraisal scores for 
      overall quality from the study by Nuckols et al. Results: We appraised 13
      guidelines, which received 43 red flags in total. Guidelines had 3.3 red flags on
      average (out of a possible seven) with range from one to six. Four guidelines had
      missing information, so red flags may be higher than reported. The guidelines
      with the highest and second highest scores for overall quality in the 2014
      critical appraisal by Nuckols et al. had five and three red flags, respectively. 
      Conclusion: Our findings reveal that the guidelines for opioid prescribing
      chronic non-cancer pain from 2007 to 2013 were at risk of bias because of
      pervasive conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry and a paucity of
      mechanisms to address bias. Even highly-rated guidelines examined in a 2014
      systematic review and critical appraisal had many red flags.

TI  - A215 PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE ARE FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED OPIOID
      ANALGESICS WHEN DISCHARGED FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.
PG  - 88-9
AB  - Background: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer a substantial
      burden of morbidity related to chronic abdominal pain and are susceptible to
      opioid dependence and abuse that is associated with increased rates of
      depression, hospitalization, and mortality. While opioid prescription and renewal
      by a single provider minimizes the long-term risk of misuse, many patients with
      IBD will seek out care in the emergency department (ED) where short-term, ‘to-go’
      use of narcotic analgesia is associated with potential treatment-related
      complications. Aims: To assess rates of opioid prescription in IBD patients
      presenting to the ED and to assess factors associated with opioid use. Methods:
      This is a retrospective analysis of cross-sectional data collected in the United 
      States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2006–2015. 
      We compared a study population of adult IBD patients (International
      Classification of Diseases ICD-9 555.X, 556.X) ≥18 years discharged from the ED
      to a control group of patients presenting with non-specific abdominal pain (ICD-9
      789.0, 564.1, 536.8). The proportion of patients given opioids in ED and at ED
      discharge were calculated with relative standard error (RSE), and national level 
      estimates were produced using survey weights. Univariable and multivariable
      logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of opioid prescription at
      discharge, expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
      Results: A total of 767,577 IBD patients were compared to 71,359,257 patients
      with non-specific abdominal pain. A total of 37.3% (RSE 4.7%) of IBD patients
      compared to 24.7% (RSE 0.8%) of controls (p<0.01) received an opioid prescription
      on ED discharge. 49.1% (RSE 5.6%) of IBD patients compared to 37.2% (RSE 0.8%) of
      patients with non-specific abdominal pain (p=0.02) received an opioid while in
      ED. Significant predictors of narcotic prescription at discharge in multivariable
      analysis included: age <50 (OR 6.83 [95% CI: 1.21, 38.48], p=0.03), non-white
      race (OR 4.73 [95% CI: 1.46, 15.39], p=0.01), and narcotic use in the ED (OR 5.27
      [95% CI: 1.96, 14.21], p<0.01). Conclusions: Nearly 40% of IBD patients were
      prescribed an opioid at discharge from the ED. This rate is significantly higher 
      than for patients who present with non-specific abdominal pain and younger,
      non-white IBD patients were disproportionately more likely to receive an opioid
      prescription. Given the risks associated with on-demand narcotic use in IBD
      patients, our data highlight a potential gap in care for accessing comprehensive 
      pain management solutions.Table 1.Survey weighted baseline demographic

TI  - Chronic Non-cancer Pain Management and Addiction: A Review.
LID - e6963
AB  - The use of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) has been a fast-rising
      treatment phenomenon in the last two decades. Though opioids are advocated in
      various chronic pain management guidelines, their use in chronic non-cancer pain 
      still remains controversial as evidence of this approach is still weak. This
      paper highlights potential adverse effects associated with opioid use in pain
      management, including an increase in tolerance, dependence, and addiction
      outcomes. Nonetheless, opioids have an important place in contemporary CNCP
      management for selected patients. However, pain management must involve regular
      monitoring and the use of a multimodal pain management strategy. It is essential 
      that the treating physician must be up-to-date with the form of therapy so that
      they have the requisite confidence to prescribe opioids and effectively manage
      adverse effects. Moreover, the adverse effects should be treated promptly to
      enhance patient compliance. Since this approach is beneficial for some patients, 
      opioid treatment should only be applied on a case by case basis.

TI  - Virtual Reality Analgesia With Interactive Eye Tracking During Brief Thermal Pain
      Stimuli: A Randomized Controlled Trial (Crossover Design).
LID - 467
AB  - In light of growing concerns about opioid analgesics, developing new
      non-pharmacologic pain control techniques has become a high priority. Adjunctive 
      virtual reality can help reduce acute pain during painful medical procedures.
      However, for some especially painful medical procedures such as burn wound
      cleaning, clinical researchers recommend that more distracting versions of
      virtual reality are needed, to further amplify the potency of virtual reality
      analgesia. The current study with healthy volunteers explores for the first time 
      whether interacting with virtual objects in Virtual Reality (VR) via “hands free”
      eye-tracking technology integrated into the VR helmet makes VR more
      effective/powerful than non-interactive/passive VR (no eye-tracking) for reducing
      pain during brief thermal pain stimuli.Method: Forty eight healthy volunteers
      participated in the main study. Using a within-subject design, each participant
      received one brief thermal pain stimulus during interactive eye tracked virtual
      reality, and each participant received another thermal pain stimulus during
      non-interactive VR (treatment order randomized). After each pain stimulus,
      participants provided subjective 0–10 ratings of cognitive, sensory and affective
      components of pain, and rated the amount of fun they had during the pain
      stimulus. Results: As predicted, interactive eye tracking increased the analgesic
      effectiveness of immersive virtual reality. Compared to the passive
      non-interactive VR condition, during the interactive eye tracked VR condition,
      participants reported significant reductions in worst pain (p < 0.001) and pain
      unpleasantness (p < 0.001). Participants reported a significantly stronger
      illusion of presence (p < 0.001), and significantly more fun in VR (p < 0.001)
      during the interactive condition compared to during passive VR. In summary, as
      predicted by our primary hypothesis, in the current laboratory acute pain analog 
      study with healthy volunteers, increasing the immersiveness of the VR system via 
      interactive eye tracking significantly increased how effectively VR reduced worst
      pain during a brief thermal pain stimulus. Although attention was not directly
      measured, the pattern of pain ratings, presence ratings, and fun ratings are
      consistent with an attentional mechanism for how VR reduces pain. Whether the
      current results generalize to clinical patient populations is another important
      topic for future research. Additional research and development is recommended.

LID - e54208
AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through allostery, and it is
      increasingly clear that chemically distinct agonists can produce different
      receptor-based effects. It has been proposed that agonists selectively promote
      receptors to recruit one cellular interacting partner over another, introducing
      allosteric ‘bias’ into the signaling system. However, the underlying hypothesis -
      that different agonists drive GPCRs to engage different cytoplasmic proteins in
      living cells - remains untested due to the complexity of readouts through which
      receptor-proximal interactions are typically inferred. We describe a cell-based
      assay to overcome this challenge, based on GPCR-interacting biosensors that are
      disconnected from endogenous transduction mechanisms. Focusing on opioid
      receptors, we directly demonstrate differences between biosensor recruitment
      produced by chemically distinct opioid ligands in living cells. We then show that
      selective recruitment applies to GRK2, a biologically relevant GPCR regulator,
      through discrete interactions of GRK2 with receptors or with G protein beta-gamma
      subunits which are differentially promoted by agonists.

TI  - Safety, Tolerability, and Effect on Opioid Use of Meloxicam IV Following
      Orthopedic Surgery.
PG  - 221-9
AB  - Objective: A Phase 3 randomized multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial (NCT02720692) compared once-daily intravenous (IV) meloxicam 30 mg to
      placebo, when added to the standard of care pain management regimens, in adults
      with moderate-to-severe pain following major elective surgery and concluded that 
      meloxicam IV had a safety profile similar to placebo and reduced opioid
      consumption. Methods: In this post hoc subgroup analysis of orthopedic surgery
      subjects, 379 subjects received meloxicam IV 30 mg or IV-administered placebo
      every 24 hrs for ≤7 doses. Safety was assessed via AEs, laboratory tests, vital
      signs, and ECG, with an emphasis on specific AEs, including injection site
      reactions, bleeding, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, thrombotic, and wound
      healing events. Daily opioid consumption was assessed during treatment. Results: 
      Among meloxicam IV-treated subjects, 64.7% experienced ≥1 AE versus 68.8% of
      placebo-treated subjects. Investigators assessed most AEs to be mild or moderate 
      in intensity and unrelated to treatment. Total opioid consumption (36.8 mg versus
      50.3 mg IV morphine equivalent dose; P=0.0081) and opioid consumption during time
      points 0‒24, 24‒48, 0‒48, and 0‒72 hrs were statistically significantly lower in 
      the meloxicam IV group. Conclusion: Meloxicam IV demonstrated no significant
      differences in the number and frequency of AEs versus placebo in subjects
      following orthopedic surgery. Opioid consumption was reduced in the meloxicam IV 
      group versus placebo. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier:
      NCT02720692).

TI  - Functional Selectivity and Antinociceptive Effects of a Novel KOPr Agonist.
LID - 188
AB  - Kappa opioid receptor (KOPr) agonists represent alternative analgesics for their 
      low abuse potential, although relevant adverse effects have limited their
      clinical use. Functionally selective KOPr agonists may activate, in a
      pathway-specific manner, G protein-mediated signaling, that produces
      antinociception, over β-arrestin 2-dependent induction of p38MAPK, which
      preferentially contributes to adverse effects. Thus, functionally selective KOPr 
      agonists biased toward G protein-coupled intracellular signaling over
      β-arrestin-2-mediated pathways may be considered candidate therapeutics possibly 
      devoid of many of the typical adverse effects elicited by classic KOPr agonists. 
      Nonetheless, the potential utility of functionally selective agonists at opioid
      receptors is still highly debated; therefore, further studies are necessary to
      fully understand whether it will be possible to develop more effective and safer 
      analgesics by exploiting functional selectivity at KOPr. In the present study we 
      investigated in vitro functional selectivity and in vivo antinociceptive effects 
      of LOR17, a novel KOPr selective peptidic agonist that we synthesized.
      LOR17-mediated effects on adenylyl cyclase inhibition, ERK1/2, p38MAPK
      phosphorylation, and astrocyte cell proliferation were studied in HEK-293 cells
      expressing hKOPr, U87-MG glioblastoma cells, and primary human astrocytes; biased
      agonism was investigated via cAMP ELISA and β-arrestin 2 recruitment assays.
      Antinociception and antihypersensitivity were assessed in mice via warm-water
      tail-withdrawal test, intraperitoneal acid-induced writhing, and a model of
      oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic cold hypersensitivity. Effects of LOR17 on
      locomotor activity, exploratory activity, and forced-swim behavior were also
      assayed. We found that LOR17 is a selective, G protein biased KOPr agonist that
      inhibits adenylyl cyclase and activates early-phase ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
      Conversely to classic KOPr agonists as U50,488, LOR17 neither induces p38MAPK
      phosphorylation nor increases KOPr-dependent, p38MAPK-mediated cell proliferation
      in astrocytes. Moreover, LOR17 counteracts, in a concentration-dependent manner, 
      U50,488-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation and astrocyte cell proliferation. Both
      U50,488 and LOR17 display potent antinociception in models of acute nociception, 
      whereas LOR17 counteracts oxaliplatin-induced thermal hypersensitivity better
      than U50,488, and it is effective after single or repeated s.c. administration.
      LOR17 administered at a dose that fully alleviated oxaliplatin-induced thermal
      hypersensitivity did not alter motor coordination, locomotor and exploratory
      activities nor induced pro-depressant-like behavior. LOR17, therefore, may emerge
      as a novel KOPr agonist displaying functional selectivity toward G protein
      signaling and eliciting antinociceptive/antihypersensitivity effects in different
      animal models, including oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.

TI  - Effect of heat shock protein 70 modulators on the development of morphine
      analgesic tolerance in rats.
PG  - 179-85
AB  - The clinical use of opioid analgesics, such as morphine, is limited by analgesic 
      tolerance, molecular mechanism of which is not well understood. Recently,
      molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) has been demonstrated to play
      important roles in morphine-induced neuroadaptation. Here, we focused on the
      involvement of Hsp70 in the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine. Rats 
      were treated with morphine (5, 10, 20 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or saline once daily
      for 10 consecutive days. Hsp70 modulator N-formyl-3,
      4-methylenedioxybenzylidine-γ-butyrolactam [KNK437, 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally 
      (i.p.)], geranylgeranylacetone (500 mg/kg, i.p.) or pifithrin-μ (20 mg/kg, i.p.) 
      was administered before morphine (10 mg/kg, subcutaneously)/saline treatment.
      Analgesic effect of morphine was measured using the tail-flick latency test, and 
      Hsp70 protein expression was examined by western blot. Analgesic effect of
      morphine decreased gradually with the increase in the number of days of morphine 
      injection, indicating development of analgesic tolerance. A significant increase 
      of Hsp70 expression in the periaqueductal gray was observed during the
      development of analgesic tolerance after repeated morphine injections. The
      development of morphine analgesic tolerance was suppressed by pre-treatment with 
      Hsp70 transcriptional inhibitor KNK437 or functional antagonist pifithrin-μ,
      while promoted by pre-treatment with Hsp70 transcriptional inducer
      geranylgeranylacetone. Our results demonstrated that the development of morphine 
      analgesic tolerance was dual regulated by Hsp70 modulators, suggesting Hsp70 as
      an interesting and new target for preventing the development of opioid analgesic 
      tolerance.

TI  - Propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia is associated with better survival
      than desflurane anesthesia in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.
LID - e0230290
AB  - Background: Previous researches have shown that anesthetic techniques may
      influence the patients’ outcomes after cancer surgery. Here, we studied the
      relationship between the type of anesthetic techniques and patients’ outcomes
      following elective robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Methods: This was a
      retrospective cohort study of patients who received elective, robot-assisted
      radical prostatectomy between January 2008 and December 2018. Patients were
      grouped according to the anesthesia they received, namely desflurane or propofol.
      A Kaplan–Meier analysis was conducted, and survival curves were presented from
      the date of surgery to death. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models
      were used to compare hazard ratios for death after propensity matching. Subgroup 
      analyses were performed for tumor-node-metastasis stage and disease progression. 
      The primary outcome was overall survival, and the secondary outcome was
      postoperative biochemical recurrence. Results: A total of 365 patients (24
      deaths, 7.0%) under desflurane anesthesia, and 266 patients (2 deaths, 1.0%)
      under propofol anesthesia were included. The all-cause mortality rate was
      significantly lower in the propofol anesthesia than in the desflurane anesthesia 
      during follow-up (P = 0.001). Two hundred sixty-four patients remained in each
      group after propensity matching. The propofol anesthesia was associated with
      improved overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval,
      0.03–0.48; P = 0.003) in the matched analysis. Subgroup analyses showed that
      patients under propofol anesthesia had less postoperative biochemical recurrence 
      than those under desflurane (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval,
      0.05–0.91; P = 0.038) in the matched analysis. Conclusions: Propofol anesthesia
      was associated with improved overall survival in robot-assisted radical
      prostatectomy compared with desflurane anesthesia. In addition, patients under
      propofol anesthesia had less postoperative biochemical recurrence.

TI  - A naturalistic observation study of medication counseling practices at retail
      chain pharmacies.
LID - 1696
AB  - Objective:: This study evaluated medication counseling procedures and trends at
      retail pharmacies in the Houston metropolitan area through a naturalistic
      observational study. Methods:: A blinded cross-sectional observational study was 
      conducted at retail pharmacies in the Houston metropolitan area. Data were
      collected by trained observers utilizing an observational log, to record various 
      parameters that could have an impact on the duration of patient-pharmacist
      interaction in a naturalistic pharmacy practice setting. Additionally, indicators
      of counseling such as utilization of the counseling window and performance of
      show-and-tell were recorded. Statistical analyses included descriptive
      statistics, t-tests, Pearson correlations, ANOVAs, and multiple linear
      regressions. Results:: One hundred and sixty-five interactions between patients
      and pharmacy staff were recorded at 45 retail pharmacies from 7 retail pharmacy
      chains. The counseling window was utilized in only 3 (1.81%) out of 165
      observations and the show-and-tell process was observed in just 1(0.61%)
      interaction during this study. Mean (SD) interaction time between patient and
      pharmacists [159.50 (84.50)] was not statistically different (p>0.05) from the
      mean interaction time between patients and pharmacy technicians [139.30 (74.19)],
      irrespective of type of the retail chain observed. However, it was influenced by 
      the number of patients waiting in queue. Patient wait time significantly differed
      by the time of the day the interaction was observed, weekends and weekdays had
      significantly different wait times and patient interaction times Multiple linear 
      regression analyses indicated that, patient interaction time, pharmacy chain
      type, initial contact (pharmacist/technician), and time of the day, were
      significantly associated with patient wait time whereas patient wait time,
      pharmacy chain type, number of patients in queue, and number of pharmacy
      technician were significantly associated with interaction time. Conclusions:: Our
      study found that the key indicators of counseling including the use of the
      counseling window and the show-and-tell process were absent, suggesting lack of
      adequate pharmacists counseling. Further studies are needed to evaluate the
      validity of this conclusion and the role of pharmacy services and its value
      towards medication use and safety.

TI  - Systematic review of the clinical consequences of butyrfentanyl and corresponding
      analogues.
PG  - 83-8
AB  - Butyrfentanyl and its analogues are being increasingly used throughout the United
      States and Europe. Currently, lethal cases are emerging across the United States,
      England, and Europe without any end in sight. We therefore performed a systematic
      review of existing case reports on the literature of butyrfentanyl and similar
      analogs. We searched PubMed and Embase for articles (up until September 2018)
      using terms such as “butyrfentanyl” or “butyrylfentanyl.” In total, our search
      found 271 articles and identified 10 for inclusion in this review. A total of 33 
      cases were found with 61% of those being fatal. The most common route of
      administration was intravenous, but other routes of administration were readily
      used such as oral, intranasal, and inhalation. Most cases reported use of
      concomitant licit and illicit pharmacological agents. The toxidrome was
      consistent with other opioid overdoses, and naloxone was successfully used in
      nine of 10 patients. We encourage toxicology screenings of novel fentanyl analogs
      such as butyrfentanyl or 4-fluorobutyrfentanyl when an opioid overdose of unknown
      nature presents.

TI  - Short-term Outcomes of Elective 2-Stage Restorative Proctocolectomy for
      Ulcerative Colitis in Korea: Does Laparoscopy Have Benefits?
PG  - 41-7
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to compare the short-term outcomes of the open and
      laparoscopic approaches to 2-stage restorative proctocolectomy (RPC) for Korean
      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the
      medical records of 73 patients with UC who underwent elective RPC between 2009
      and 2016. Patient characteristics, operative details, and postoperative
      complications within 30 days were compared between the open and laparoscopic
      groups. Results: There were 26 cases (36%) in the laparoscopic group, which had a
      lower mean body mass index (P = 0.025), faster mean time to recovery of bowel
      function (P = 0.004), less intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.004), and less pain
      on the first and seventh postoperative days (P = 0.029 and P = 0.027,
      respectively) compared to open group. There were no deaths, and the overall
      complication rate was 43.8%. There was no between-group difference in the overall
      complication rate; however, postoperative ileus was more frequent in the open
      group (27.7% vs. 7.7%, P = 0.043). Current smoking (odds ratio [OR], 44.4; P =
      0.003) and open surgery (OR, 5.4; P = 0.014) were the independent risk factors
      for postoperative complications after RPC. Conclusion: Laparoscopic RPC was
      associated with acceptable morbidity and faster recovery than the open approach. 
      The laparoscopic approach is a feasible and safe option for surgical treatment
      for UC in selective cases.

TI  - Metronidazole in the Management of Post-Open Haemorrhoidectomy Pain: Systematic
      Review.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - Purpose: Open haemorrhoidectomy is associated with significant postoperative
      pain. Metronidazole is commonly prescribed in the postoperative period as an
      adjunct to analgesia in pain management. Methods: In our systematic review,
      studies were identified using PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase/Ovid and Cochrane Register
      of Controlled Trials databases. Studies were included if they were randomised
      controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions with oral metronidazole at any
      dose over any time period. The primary outcome was pain score (visual analogue
      scale, VAS) after open haemorrhoidectomy. Secondary outcomes included time to
      return to normal daily activities, additional analgesia usage, and postoperative 
      complications. Results: Of 14 RCTs reviewed, 4 met inclusion criteria and were
      selected. The studies comprised 336 study subjects and 169 subjects were
      randomised to metronidazole while 167 were in the control group. There was a
      significant reduction in VAS across all time points, with maximal reduction seen 
      on day 5 posthaemorrhoidectomy (mean difference, -2.28; 95% confidence interval, 
      -2.49 to -2.08; P < 0.001). There was no difference in incidence of complications
      (P = 0.13). The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool showed 3 of 4 of the studies had a
      risk of bias. Conclusion: Metronidazole may be associated with decreased pain but
      there is insufficient evidence from RCTs to provide a strong grade of
      recommendation. Further RCTs are required.

TI  - Testicular toxicity following chronic codeine administration is via oxidative DNA
      damage and up-regulation of NO/TNF-α and caspase 3 activities.
LID - e0224052
AB  - Background: Codeine, a 3-methylmorphine, and other related opioids have been
      implicated in androgen suppression, although the associated mechanisms remain
      unclear. Aim: Therefore, the objective of the current study was to elucidate the 
      in vivo molecular mechanisms underlying codeine-induced androgen suppression.
      Methods: This study made use of twenty-one healthy male rabbits, distributed into
      three groups randomly, control and codeine-treated groups. The control had 1ml of
      normal saline daily p.o. The codeine-treated groups received either 4mg/kg b.w of
      codeine or 10mg/kg b.w of codeine p.o. for six weeks. Reproductive hormonal
      profile, testicular weight, testicular enzymes, oxidative and inflammatory
      parameters, testicular DNA fragmentation, histological examination and apoptosis 
      marker were evaluated to examine the effects of codeine use. Key findings: Oral
      administration of codeine resulted in testicular atrophy and alterations in
      testicular histomorphology, elevated testicular enzymes, and suppression of
      circulatory and intra-testicular testosterone. These changes were associated with
      a marked rise in oxidative markers and decline in the activities of testicular
      enzymatic antioxidants, as well as oxidative DNA damage, inflammatory response,
      testicular DNA fragmentation, and caspase-dependent apoptosis (p<0.05).
      Significance: In conclusion, chronic codeine use resulted in testicular
      degeneration and testosterone suppression, which is attributable to TNF-α/nitric 
      oxide-/oxidative stress-mediated caspase-dependent apoptotic testicular cell
      death and loss of testicular function.

TI  - Caregiving motivations and experiences among family caregivers of patients living
      with advanced breast cancer in Ghana.
LID - e0229683
AB  - Introduction: Significant number of women present with advanced-stage breast
      cancer in Ghana. These women usually depend on family caregivers for their
      multi-dimensional needs. Yet, there are gaps in research about what motivates
      family caregivers to assume the caring role and their experiences with caregiving
      within the Ghanaian context. Aim: To explore and describe the caregiving
      motivations and experiences among family caregivers of patients living with
      advanced breast cancer. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews
      were conducted with 15 family caregivers who were providing unpaid care for women
      living with advanced breast cancer. Colaizzi’s thematic analysis was used to
      analyze the data. Results: Family relationship normally prescribed the caregiving
      role among family caregivers. Due to the lack of home-based palliative services
      in Ghana, findings suggest that family caregivers are the main managers of
      advanced breast cancer-related symptoms in the home. These findings are discussed
      under three major themes: (i) motivation for assuming the caregiving role; (ii)
      meeting self-care and psychosocial needs of the patient; and (iii) symptom
      management and monitoring. Conclusion: Socio-cultural values influence the role
      of family caregivers in Ghana. This presents opportunities for health
      professionals and relevant stakeholders to develop a culturally-appropriate
      intervention to support informal caregivers in their home-based care for women
      living with advanced breast cancer in Ghana.

TI  - Dysbiosis of the gut and lung microbiome has a role in asthma.
PG  - 75-93
AB  - Worldwide 300 million children and adults are affected by asthma. The development
      of asthma is influenced by environmental and other exogenous factors synergizing 
      with genetic predisposition, and shaping the lung microbiome especially during
      birth and in very early life. The healthy lung microbial composition is
      characterized by a prevalence of bacteria belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes,
      Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. However, viral respiratory infections are
      associated with an abundance of Proteobacteria with genera Haemophilus and
      Moraxella in young children and adult asthmatics. This dysbiosis supports the
      activation of inflammatory pathways and contributes to bronchoconstriction and
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Exogenous factors can affect the natural lung
      microbiota composition positively (farming environment) or negatively (allergens,
      air pollutants). It is evident that also gut microbiota dysbiosis has a high
      influence on asthma pathogenesis. Antibiotics, antiulcer medications, and other
      drugs severely impair gut as well as lung microbiota. Resulting dysbiosis and
      reduced microbial diversity dysregulate the bidirectional crosstalk across the
      gut-lung axis, resulting in hypersensitivity and hyperreactivity to respiratory
      and food allergens. Efforts are undertaken to reconstitute the microbiota and
      immune balance by probiotics and engineered bacteria, but results from human
      studies do not yet support their efficacy in asthma prevention or treatment.
      Overall, dysbiosis of gut and lung seem to be critical causes of the increased
      emergence of asthma.

TI  - Fatal overdose prevention and experience with naloxone: A cross-sectional study
      from a community-based cohort of people who inject drugs in Baltimore, Maryland.
LID - e0230127
AB  - Introduction: Overdose is a leading cause of death in the United States,
      especially among people who inject drugs (PWID). Improving naloxone access and
      carrying among PWID may offset recent increases in overdose mortality associated 
      with the influx of synthetic opioids in the drug market. This study characterized
      prevalence and correlates of several naloxone outcomes among PWID. Methods:
      During 2018, a survey to assess experience with naloxone was administered to 915 
      participants in the AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) study, an
      ongoing community-based observational cohort of people who currently inject or
      formerly injected drugs in Baltimore, Maryland. We examined the associations of
      naloxone outcomes (training, supply, use, and regular possession) with
      socio-demographic, substance use and healthcare utilization factors among PWID in
      order to characterize gaps in naloxone implementation among this high-risk
      population. Results: Median age was 56 years, 34% were female, 85% were African
      American, and 31% recently injected. In the past six months, 46% (n = 421)
      reported receiving training in overdose prevention, 38% (n = 346) had received a 
      supply of naloxone, 9% (n = 85) had administered naloxone, and 9% (n = 82)
      reported usually carrying a supply of naloxone. Recent non-fatal overdose was not
      associated with any naloxone outcomes in adjusted analysis. Active opioid use
      (aOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.28) and recent treatment of alcohol or substance use
      disorder (aOR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.13, 3.56) were associated with regularly carrying
      naloxone. Conclusion: Further work is needed to encourage PWID to carry and
      effectively use naloxone to decrease rates of fatal opioid overdose. While
      accessing treatment for substance use disorder was positively associated with
      carrying naloxone, EMS response to 911 calls for overdose, the emergency
      department, and syringe services programs may be settings in which naloxone
      access and carrying could be encouraged among PWID.

LID - e0230199
AB  - Objectives: Infective endocarditis (IE) with non-HACEK Gram-negative (GN)
      organisms is rare, but associated with poor outcomes. The purpose of this study
      was to quantify the microbiology, treatment strategies, and frequency of poor
      outcomes in patients with non-HACEK GN IE. Materials: Retrospective cohort of
      adults with definite non-HACEK GN IE from 1/11-1/19. The primary endpoint was
      poor patient outcome, defined as a composite of all-cause death or
      infection-related readmission within 90-days of index infection. Results: 43
      patients were included: 51% patients were men, and the median (IQR) age was 40
      (31–50) years. Forty patients reported injection drug use. The most common
      organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (68%) and Serratia marcescens (9%).
      Seventy-six percent of patients received definitive combination therapy; the most
      common antibiotics used in combination with a β-lactam were aminoglycosides (50%)
      and fluoroquinolones (34%). Three patients discontinued combination therapy due
      to toxicity. Twelve-month, all-cause mortality and readmission was 30% and 54%,
      respectively. In multivariable logistic regression, variables independently
      associated with composite poor outcome were receipt of fluoroquinolone-based IE
      combination therapy and septic shock. Conclusions: Long-term mortality and
      readmission rates were high. Patients who received fluoroquinolone-based IE
      combination therapy more frequently developed poor outcomes than those who did
      not.

TI  - External Validation of a Pharmacokinetic Model of Propofol for Target-Controlled 
      Infusion in Children under Two Years Old.
LID - e70
AB  - Background: Previously, a linked pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model (the Kim
      model) of propofol with concurrent infusion of remifentanil was developed for
      children aged 2–12 years. There are few options for
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of propofol for children under two years
      old. We performed an external validation of the Kim model for children under two 
      years old to evaluate whether the model is applicable to this age group. Methods:
      Twenty-four children were enrolled. After routine anesthetic induction, a
      continuous infusion of 2% propofol and remifentanil was commenced using the Kim
      model. The target effect-site concentration of propofol was set as 2, 3, 4, and 5
      μg/mL, followed by arterial blood sampling after 10 min of each equilibrium.
      Population estimates of four parameters—pooled bias, inaccuracy, divergence, and 
      wobble—were used to evaluate the performance of the Kim model. Results: A total
      of 95 plasma concentrations were used for evaluation of the Kim model. The
      population estimate (95% confidence interval) of bias was −0.96% (−8.45%, 6.54%) 
      and that of inaccuracy was 21.0% (15.0%–27.0%) for the plasma concentration of
      propofol. Conclusion: The pooled bias and inaccuracy of the pharmacokinetic
      predictions are clinically acceptable. Therefore, our external validation of the 
      Kim model indicated that the model can be applicable to target-controlled
      infusion of propofol in children younger than 2 years, with the recommended use
      of actual bispectral index monitoring in clinical settings that remifentanil is
      present. Trial Registration: Clinical Research Information Service Identifier:

TI  - Canadian Guidelines on Alcohol Use Disorder Among Older Adults.
PG  - 143-8
AB  - Background: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is an increasingly common,
      under-recognized, and under-treated health concern in older adults. Its
      prevalence is expected to reach unprecedented levels as the Canadian population
      ages. In response, Health Canada commissioned the Canadian Coalition of Seniors’ 
      Mental Health to create guidelines for the prevention, screening, assessment, and
      treatment of AUD in older adults. Methods: A systematic review of English
      language literature from 2008–2018 regarding AUD in adults was conducted.
      Previously published guidelines were evaluated using AGREE II, and key guidelines
      updated using ADAPTE method by drawing on current literature. Recommendations
      were created and assessed using the GRADE method. Results: Twenty-two
      recommendations were created. Prevention recommendations: Best advice for older
      adults who choose to drink is to limit intake to well below the national Low-Risk
      Alcohol Drinking Guidelines. Screening recommendations: Alcohol consumption
      should be reviewed and discussed on an annual basis by primary care providers.
      This type of discussion needs to be normalized and approached in a simple,
      neutral, straight-forward manner. Assessment recommendations: Positive screens
      for AUD should be followed by a comprehensive assessment. Once more details are
      obtained an individualized treatment plan can be recommended, negotiated, and
      implemented. Treatment recommendations: AUD falls on a spectrum of mild,
      moderate, and severe. It can also be complicated by concurrent mental health,
      physical, or social issues, especially in older adults. Naltrexone and
      Acamprosate pharmacotherapies can be used for the treatment of AUD in older
      adults, as individually indicated. Psychosocial treatment and support should be
      offered as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Conclusion: These guidelines
      provide practical and timely clinical recommendations on the prevention,
      assessment, and treatment of AUD in older adults within the Canadian context.

TI  - Canadian Guidelines on Opioid Use Disorder Among Older Adults.
PG  - 123-34
AB  - Background: In Canada, rates of hospital admission from opioid overdose are
      higher for older adults (≥ 65) than younger adults, and opioid use disorder (OUD)
      is a growing concern. In response, Health Canada commissioned the Canadian
      Coalition of Seniors’ Mental Health to create guidelines for the prevention,
      screening, assessment, and treatment of OUD in older adults. Methods: A
      systematic review of English language literature from 2008–2018 regarding OUD in 
      adults was conducted. Previously published guidelines were evaluated using AGREE 
      II, and key guidelines updated using ADAPTE method, by drawing on current
      literature. Recommendations were created and assessed using the GRADE method.
      Results: Thirty-two recommendations were created. Prevention recommendations: it 
      is key to prioritize non-pharmacological and non-opioid strategies to treat acute
      and chronic noncancer pain. Assessment recommendations: a comprehensive
      assessment is important to help discern contributions of other medical
      conditions. Treatment recommendations: buprenorphine is first line for both
      withdrawal management and maintenance therapy, while methadone, slow-release oral
      morphine, or naltrexone can be used as alternatives under certain circumstances; 
      non-pharmacological treatments should be offered as an integrated part of care.
      Conclusion: These guidelines provide practical and timely clinical
      recommendations on the prevention, assessment, and treatment of OUD in older
      adults within the Canadian context.

TI  - The Effect of Carotid Chemoreceptor Inhibition on Exercise Tolerance in Chronic
      Heart Failure.
LID - 195
AB  - Purpose: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterized by heightened sympathetic
      nervous activity, carotid chemoreceptor (CC) sensitivity, marked exercise
      intolerance and an exaggerated ventilatory response to exercise. The purpose of
      this study was to determine the effect of CC inhibition on exercise
      cardiovascular and ventilatory function, and exercise tolerance in health and
      CHF. Methods: Twelve clinically stable, optimally treated patients with CHF (mean
      ejection fraction: 43 ± 2.5%) and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were
      recruited. Participants completed two time-to-symptom-limitation (TLIM) constant 
      load cycling exercise tests at 75% peak power output with either intravenous
      saline or low-dose dopamine (2 μg⋅kg–1⋅min–1; order randomized). Ventilation was 
      measured using expired gas data and operating lung volume data were determined
      during exercise by inspiratory capacity maneuvers. Cardiac output was estimated
      using impedance cardiography, and vascular conductance was calculated as cardiac 
      output/mean arterial pressure. Results: There was no change in TLIM in either
      group with dopamine (CHF: saline 13.1 ± 2.4 vs. dopamine 13.5 ± 1.6 min, p =
      0.78; Control: saline 10.3 ± 1.2 vs. dopamine 11.5 ± 1.3 min, p = 0.16). In CHF
      patients, dopamine increased cardiac output (p = 0.03), vascular conductance (p =
      0.01) and oxygen delivery (p = 0.04) at TLIM, while ventilatory parameters were
      unaffected (p = 0.76). In controls, dopamine improved vascular conductance at
      TLIM (p = 0.03), but no other effects were observed. Conclusion: Our findings
      suggest that the CC contributes to cardiovascular regulation during full-body
      exercise in patients with CHF, however, CC inhibition does not improve exercise
      tolerance.

TI  - Practical considerations for performing regional anesthesia: lessons learned from
      the COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health
      Organization on 11 March 2020 because of its rapid worldwide spread. In the
      operating room, as part of hospital outbreak response measures, anesthesiologists
      are required to have heightened precautions and tailor anesthetic practices to
      individual patients. In particular, by minimizing the many aerosol-generating
      procedures performed during general anesthesia, anesthesiologists can reduce
      exposure to patients’ respiratory secretions and the risk of perioperative viral 
      transmission to healthcare workers and other patients. To avoid any airway
      manipulation, regional anesthesia should be considered whenever surgery is
      planned for a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patient or any patient who poses an
      infection risk. Regional anesthesia has benefits of preservation of respiratory
      function, avoidance of aerosolization and hence viral transmission. This article 
      explores the practical considerations and recommended measures for performing
      regional anesthesia in this group of patients, focusing on control measures
      geared towards ensuring patient and staff safety, equipment protection, and
      infection prevention. By doing so, we hope to address an issue that may have
      downstream implications in the way we practice infection control in anesthesia,
      with particular relevance to this new era of emerging infectious diseases and
      novel pathogens. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      is not the first, and certainly will not be the last novel virus that will lead
      to worldwide outbreaks. Having a well thought out regional anesthesia plan to
      manage these patients in this new normal will ensure the best possible outcome
      for both the patient and the perioperative management team.

TI  - Prolonged-Release (PR) Oxycodone/Naloxone Improves Bowel Function Compared with
      Oxycodone PR and Provides Effective Analgesia in Chinese Patients with
      Non-malignant Pain: A Randomized, Double-Blind Trial.
PG  - 1188-202
AB  - Introduction: Prolonged-release oxycodone/naloxone (OXN PR), combining an opioid 
      analgesic with selective blockade of enteric µ-opioid receptors, provided
      effective analgesia and improved bowel function in patients with
      moderate-to-severe pain and opioid-induced constipation in clinical trials
      predominantly conducted in Western countries. This double-blind randomized
      controlled trial investigated OXN PR (N = 116) versus prolonged-release oxycodone
      (OXY PR, N = 115) for 8 weeks at doses up to 50 mg/day in patients with
      moderate-to-severe, chronic, non-malignant musculoskeletal pain and
      opioid-induced constipation recruited in China. Methods: A total of 234 patients 
      at least 18 years of age with non-malignant musculoskeletal pain for more than
      4 weeks that was moderate-to-severe in intensity and required round-the-clock
      opioid therapy were randomized (1:1) to OXN PR or OXY PR. The primary endpoint
      was bowel function using the Bowel Function Index (BFI). Secondary endpoints
      included safety, Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), use of analgesic and
      laxative rescue medication, and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D). Results: 
      While BFI scores were comparable at baseline, at week 8 improvements were greater
      with OXN PR vs OXY PR (least squares mean [LSM] difference (95% CI) − 9.1
      (− 14.0, − 4.2); P < 0.001. From weeks 2 to 8, mean BFI scores were in the range 
      of normal bowel function (≤ 28.8) with OXN PR but were in the range of
      constipation (> 28.8) at all timepoints with OXY PR. Analgesia with OXN PR was
      similar and non-inferior to OXY PR on the basis of modified BPI-SF average 24-h
      pain scores at week 8: LSM difference (95% CI) − 0.3 (− 0.5, − 0.1); P < 0.001.
      The most frequent treatment-related AEs were nausea (OXN PR 5% vs OXY PR 6%) and 
      dizziness (4% vs 4%). Conclusion: OXN PR provided clinically meaningful

TI  - Severe Cervicofacial Cellulitis in Pregnancy- A Review of 18 Cases.
PG  - 93-100
AB  - Introduction:: Cervicofacial cellulitis can be rapidly complicated with a
      difficult airway when prompt management is not instituted. It may have some
      serious consequences for developing baby when a pregnant woman is involved. This 
      study presented the experiences gained from the management of cervicofacial
      cellulitis in pregnant women. Materials and Methods:: The present study was
      conducted on 18 pregnant women with cervicofacial cellulitis affecting more than 
      one facial space at the presentation in a regional tertiary hospital within a
      five-year period (January 2013 to December 2017). The collected information
      included patient age, clinical diagnosis, number of involved facial spaces,
      gestational periods, and duration of hospital stay. The collected data were
      analyzed using SPSS software (version 15.0). Results:: A total of 131 patients
      with cervicofacial cellulitis were admitted during the study period, out of which
      18 patients met the inclusion criteria and were investigated in the present
      study. These 18 patients were within the age range of 20-43 years with the mean
      age of 29±7.1 years. There was a statistically significant relationship between
      the number of fascial spaces involved and duration of hospital stay (P=0.04). All
      the patients had incision and drainage of the affected facial spaces under local 
      anesthesia with good outcomes. Conclusion:: The prompt management of pregnant
      women with cervicofacial cellulitis in a multidisciplinary manner is important to
      ensure uneventful outcomes in the lives of both the pregnant woman and unborn
      child.

TI  - Regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic potential of microglial inhibitors in
      neuropathic pain and morphine tolerance*.
PG  - 204-17
AB  - Microglia are important cells involved in the regulation of neuropathic pain
      (NPP) and morphine tolerance. Information on their plasticity and polarity has
      been elucidated after determining their physiological structure, but there is
      still much to learn about the role of this type of cell in NPP and morphine
      tolerance. Microglia mediate multiple functions in health and disease by
      controlling damage in the central nervous system (CNS) and endogenous immune
      responses to disease. Microglial activation can result in altered opioid system
      activity, and NPP is characterized by resistance to morphine. Here we investigate
      the regulatory mechanisms of microglia and review the potential of microglial
      inhibitors for modulating NPP and morphine tolerance. Targeted inhibition of
      glial activation is a clinically promising approach to the treatment of NPP and
      the prevention of morphine tolerance. Finally, we suggest directions for future
      research on microglial inhibitors.

TI  - Local Infiltration Analgesia with Ropivacaine Improves Postoperative Pain Control
      in Ankle Fracture Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
LID - 8542849
AB  - Purpose: The study aimed at investigating the effect of local infiltration
      analgesia (LIA) with ropivacaine on postoperative analgesia for patients
      undergoing ankle fracture surgery. Methods: Consecutive patients were
      retrospectively included and analysed according to their medical records from
      July 2014 to August 2018 in a tertiary hospital. Inclusion criteria were patients
      undergoing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for ankle fractures under 
      general anaesthesia. Moreover, patients should have received intravenous
      patient-controlled analgesia (iPCA) or LIA + iPCA for postoperative pain relief. 
      The primary outcome indicator was visual analogue scale (VAS) from 8 hours to 48 
      hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes included postoperative opioid
      requirement, need for rescue medication, opioid-related adverse effects, and
      wound complications. Results: In total, 89 consecutive patients were included in 
      the study. There were 48 males and 41 females. The average age was 44.6 ± 7.0
      years, and VAS scores were significantly lower in the LIA + iPCA group at 8 hours
      after surgery (1.51 ± 0.58 cm vs 4.77 ± 1.83 cm, p < 0.001). The time to first
      tramadol consumption was longer (580 ± 60.9 minutes vs 281 ± 86.4 minutes, p <
      0.001). The time to first tramadol consumption was longer (580 ± 60.9 minutes vs 
      281 ± 86.4 minutes, p < 0.001). The time to first tramadol consumption was longer
      (580 ± 60.9 minutes vs 281 ± 86.4 minutes, p < 0.001). The time to first tramadol
      consumption was longer (580 ± 60.9 minutes vs 281 ± 86.4 minutes, p < 0.001). The
      time to first tramadol consumption was longer (580 ± 60.9 minutes vs 281 ± 86.4
      minutes, Conclusions: The retrospective cohort study indicates that LIA with
      ropivacaine can provide better early postoperative pain management with a
      reduction of VAS scores for ankle fracture surgery. Patients receiving wound
      infiltration also experience decreased opioid consumption, a lower rate of
      analgesia-related side effects, and comparable wound complication rate.

TI  - Regional Anesthesia for Pain Management After Orthopedic Procedures for Treatment
      of Lower Extremity Length Discrepancy.
PG  - 547-52
AB  - Introduction: The use of regional anesthesia techniques continues to expand in a 
      wide variety of surgical procedures as the benefits and safety are increasingly
      appreciated. Limb-lengthening procedures are often associated with significant
      postoperative pain and high opioid requirements which may impact patient’s
      recovery and increase risk of chronic pain and long-term opioid use. Methods: The
      current study retrospectively reviews our experience utilizing a novel peripheral
      nerve catheter (PNC) protocol for postoperative pain management in patients
      undergoing elective limb-lengthening procedures. We measure total opioid
      consumption following 48 hrs in the postoperative period between groups. Results:
      A total of 70 patients were included from which 41 received general plus regional
      anesthesia (RA) and 29 were managed with general anesthesia alone (NORA).
      Postoperative pain needs were calculated as morphine equivalents (ME). There were
      no differences in the demographic characteristics between the groups. Over the
      first 48 postoperative hours, opioid use was 0.5 mg/kg ME (IQR 0.3, 0.9) in the
      RA group versus 1.7 mg/kg ME (IQR 1.1, 3.1) in the NORA group (p<0.001). Subgroup
      analysis between femoral lengthening and tibial-fibular lengthening procedures
      demonstrated the same opioid-sparing effect favoring the RA group compared to the
      NORA group. Hospital length of stay was significantly shorter in the femoral
      lengthening RA group compared to NORA group (32 hrs [IQR 29, 35] versus 53 hrs
      [IQR 33, 55], respectively). There was no significant difference in length of
      stay between the RA group and NORA group after tibial-fibular lengthening
      procedures. Discussion: Regional anesthesia via continuous catheter infusions has
      a clinically significant opioid-sparing effect for postoperative pain management 
      after limb-lengthening procedures and may facilitate earlier hospital discharge.

AB  - Patient: Male, 75-year-oldFinal Diagnosis: CholangiocarcinomaSymptoms:
      Postoperative painMedication:—Clinical Procedure: Continuous erector spinae nerve
      blockSpecialty: OncologyObjective:: Unusual clinical course Background:: Regional
      nerve blocks ideally provide safe and effective post-operative pain control,
      decrease opiate requirements, and enhance recovery from intense pain following
      major thoracic, abdominal, and musculoskeletal surgeries. The erector spinae
      plane block, a recently described novel treatment for chronic neuropathic pain
      and acute pain after thoracic surgery, can be performed with in plane
      infiltration and placement of a continuous infusion catheter deep to the erector 
      spinae muscle at the tip of the transverse process, resulting in diffusion of
      local anesthetic between vertebrae and the paravertebral space with sensory
      blockade of spinal nerves as well as sympathetic branches. Case Report:: We
      describe the novel use of the erector spinae block for primary pain control and
      uncomplicated catheter removal in the setting of anticoagulation following a
      major hepatectomy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The use of the erector
      spinae block in this context provided effective post-operative analgesia.
      Conclusions:: Additional evidence from clinical trials will be helpful to
      evaluate the role of this relatively new block for peri-operative analgesia.

AB  - Background: Several small studies have previously investigated associations
      between the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolism and response to opioids. We
      used a large sample of patients to study associations between CYP2D6 phenotypes
      and estimated CYP2D6 enzymatic activity scores with pain control and adverse
      reactions related to codeine and tramadol use. We conducted additional analyses
      to determine whether our results were consistent among men and women. Methods: We
      used data from 2,877 participants in the RIGHT Protocol who were prescribed
      codeine and/or tramadol between 01/01/2005 and 12/31/2017 and who were not
      prescribed CYP2D6 inhibitors within 1 year prior to the opioid prescription.
      CYP2D6 phenotype categories were condensed into four groups: (1) Ultra-rapid and 
      Rapid (n = 61), (2) Normal and Intermediate to Normal (n = 1,448), (3)
      Intermediate and Intermediate to Poor (n = 1,175), and (4) Poor metabolizer
      status (n = 193). Opioid-related outcomes included indications of poor pain
      control or adverse reactions related to medication use. We modeled the risk of
      each outcome using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, race, and
      ethnicity. Results: The results revealed a trend from poor to ultra-rapid and
      rapid CYP2D6 phenotypes in which the risk of adverse reactions incrementally
      increased and the risk of poor pain control incrementally decreased. This trend
      reached statistical significance among female (but not male) participants. Among 
      normal and intermediate to normal metabolizers, a larger proportion of women
      experienced adverse reactions relative to men. Discussion: We replicated and
      extended the findings of previous research indicating associations between CYP2D6
      phenotypes and response to opioids. In addition, the observed associations were
      stronger in women than in men. We recommend sex differences to be factored in
      future research investigating associations between pharmacogenomics and response 
      to medications.

TI  - Vascular safety of erenumab for migraine prevention.
PG  - e497-510
AB  - Objective: To examine the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral
      vascular safety of erenumab across migraine prevention studies. Methods: Vascular
      adverse events (AEs) and blood pressure data were integrated across 4
      double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of erenumab and their open-label
      extensions in patients with chronic or episodic migraine. Subgroup analyses were 
      conducted by acute migraine-specific medication use and number of vascular risk
      factors at baseline. Standardized search terms were used to identify vascular AEs
      (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or peripheral). An independent committee
      adjudicated whether targeted events were vascular in origin. Results: In
      placebo-controlled studies, 2,443 patients received placebo (n = 1,043), erenumab
      70 mg (n = 893), or erenumab 140 mg (n = 507) subcutaneously once monthly.
      Regardless of acute migraine-specific medication use or vascular risk factors at 
      baseline, AE incidence was similar across the placebo and erenumab treatment
      groups. Hypertension AEs were reported for 0.9% (placebo), 0.8% (erenumab 70 mg),
      and 0.2% (erenumab 140 mg) of patients. Vascular AEs, which were similar across
      double-blind and open-label treatment, generally were confounded, with plausible 
      alternative etiologies. In 18 patients with events reviewed by the independent
      committee, 4 events were positively adjudicated as cardiovascular in origin: 2
      deaths and 2 vascular events. All 4 positively adjudicated cardiovascular events 
      occurred during open-label erenumab treatment. Conclusion: Selective blockade of 
      the canonical calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor with erenumab for migraine
      prevention had a vascular safety profile comparable to that of placebo over 12
      weeks, with no increased emergence of events over time. Further study of
      long-term safety of erenumab in patients with migraine is needed.
      Clinicaltrials.gov identifiers: NCT02066415, NCT02456740, NCT01952574,
      NCT02483585, NCT02174861, and NCT01723514. Classification of evidence: This
      analysis provides Class II evidence that for patients with migraine, erenumab
      does not increase the risk of vascular AEs.

      Concentrations in Beagle Plasma by UPLC-MS/MS and Application for
      Pharmacokinetics Study.
PG  - 1117-25
AB  - A method for the simultaneous determination of parecoxib and its metabolite
      valdecoxib in beagle plasma by UPLC-MS/MS was developed and validated. After the 
      plasma was extracted by acetonitrile precipitation, the analytes were separated
      on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) using
      acetonitrile-formic acid as the mobile phase in gradient mode. The analytes were 
      monitored by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in electrospray negative ion
      mode. The mass transfer pairs were m/z 368.97→119.01 for parecoxib, m/z
      312.89→118.02 for valdecoxib, and m/z 379.98→316.02 for celecoxib (internal
      standard, IS). The correlation coefficients of parecoxib and valdecoxib ranged
      from 5 to 4000 ng/mL were greater than 0.9998. The recovery of parecoxib and
      valdecoxib was greater than 82.54%. The inter- and intra-day precision RSD values
      were 1.36~3.65% and 2.28~5.91%, respectively. The accuracy of RE values were
      −1.38%~1.96%. Finally, the matrix effect (ME) and stability were also within
      acceptable criteria. This method had been successfully applied to the
      pharmacokinetics of parecoxib and valdecoxib in beagle plasma after injection of 
      parecoxib (1.33 mg/kg, intramuscular injection).

TI  - Midazolam: an essential palliative care drug.
LID - 2632352419895527
AB  - Midazolam is a commonly used benzodiazepine in palliative care and is considered 
      one of the four essential drugs needed for the promotion of quality care in dying
      patients. Acting on the benzodiazepine receptor, it promotes the action of
      gamma-aminobutyric acid. Gamma-aminobutyric acid action promotes sedative,
      anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant properties. Midazolam has a faster onset and
      shorter duration of action than other benzodiazepines such as diazepam and
      lorazepam lending itself to greater flexibility in dosing than other
      benzodiazepines. The kidneys excrete midazolam and its active metabolite.
      Metabolism occurs in the liver by the P450 system. This article examines the
      pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, and clinical uses of midazolam in palliative
      care.

TI  - Prescription Drug Misuse: Taking a Lifespan Perspective.
LID - 1178221820909352
AB  - Prescription drug misuse (PDM), or medication use without a prescription or in
      ways not intended by the prescriber, is a notable public health concern,
      especially in the United States. Accumulating research has characterized PDM
      prevalence and processes, but age-based or lifespan changes in PDM are
      understudied. Given age-based differences in the medical or developmental
      concerns that often underlie PDM, it is likely that PDM varies by age. This
      review summarizes the literature on PDM across the lifespan, examining lifespan
      changes in prevalence, sources, motives and correlates for opioid, stimulant, and
      tranquilizer/sedative (or benzodiazepine) PDM. In all, prevalence rates, sources 
      and motives vary considerably by age group, with fewer age-based differences in
      correlates or risk factors. PDM prevalence rates tend to decline with aging, with
      greater use of physician sources and greater endorsement of self-treatment
      motives in older groups. Recreational motives (such as to get high) tend to peak 
      in young adulthood, with greater use of peer sources or purchases to obtain
      medication for PDM in younger groups. PDM co-occurs with other substance use and 
      psychopathology, including suicidality, across age groups. The evidence for
      lifespan variation in PDM is strongest for opioid PDM, with a need for more
      research on tranquilizer/sedative and stimulant PDM. The current literature is
      limited by the few studies of lifespan changes in PDM within a single sample, a
      lack of longitudinal research, little research addressing PDM in the context of
      polysubstance use, and little research on minority groups, such as sexual and
      gender minorities.

TI  - You just have to have other models, our DNA is different: the experiences of
      indigenous people who use illicit drugs and/or alcohol accessing substance use
      treatment.
LID - 19
AB  - Objectives: In Canada, and elsewhere, indigenous peoples who use illicit drugs
      and/or alcohol (IPWUID/A) commonly experience vulnerability and a
      disproportionate burden of harm related to substance use. In Vancouver, Canada,
      there are concerns that inequitable access, retention, and post treatment care
      within substance use treatment programs may exacerbate these harms. This study
      sought to understand the policies and practices with the potential to produce
      inequities and vulnerabilities for IPWUID/A in substance use treatment, situate
      the vulnerabilities of IPWUID/A in substance use treatment within the context of 
      wider structural vulnerability of IPWUID/A, and generate recommendations for
      culturally safe treatment options. Methods: This research employed a qualitative 
      indigenous-led community-based approach using the indigenous methodology of
      talking circles to explore experiences with substance use treatment. Under the
      participatory research framework, community researchers led the study design,
      data collection, and analysis. Talking circles elicited peers’ experiences of
      substance use treatment and were audio-recorded and transcribed. Results: The
      talking circles identified three key themes that illustrated the experiences of
      IPWUID/A when accessing substance use treatment: (a) barriers to accessing detox 
      and substance use treatment; (b) incompatible and culturally inappropriate
      structure, policies, and procedures within treatment programs, such as forced
      Christianity within treatment settings; and (c) the importance of culturally
      relevant, peer-led substance use treatment programming. Discussion: Our work
      demonstrates that some IPWUID/A have limited access to or retention in mainstream
      treatment due to excessive waiting times, strict rules, and lack of cultural
      appropriate care while in treatment. However, IPWUID/A narratives revealed
      strategies that can improve IPWUID/A access and experiences, including those
      informed by the diverse perspectives of IPWUID/A and those that include
      trauma-informed and culturally safe practices.

TI  - Evaluating networked drug checking services in Toronto, Ontario: study protocol
      and rationale.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: The increasing incidence of fatal opioid overdose is a public health 
      crisis in Canada. Given growing consensus that this crisis is related to the
      presence of highly potent opioid adulterants (e.g., fentanyl) in the unregulated 
      drug supply, drug checking services (DCS) have emerged as part of a comprehensive
      approach to overdose prevention. In Canada’s largest city, Toronto, a network of 
      DCS launched in 2019 to prevent overdose and overdose-related risk behaviors.
      This network employs mass spectrometry technologies, with intake sites co-located
      with supervised consumption services (SCS) at three frontline harm reduction
      agencies. The protocol and rationale for assessing the impact of this multi-site 
      DCS network in Toronto is described herein. The aims of this study are to (1)
      evaluate the impact of DCS access on changes in and factors influencing overdose 
      and related risk behaviors, (2) investigate the perceived capacity of DCS to
      prevent overdose, and (3) identify composition (qualitative and quantitative)
      trends in Toronto’s unregulated drug supply. Methods: We will use a
      parallel-mixed-methods design with complementary data sources (including data
      from chemical analysis of drug samples, quantitative intake and post-test
      surveys, SCS, coroners, paramedic services, and qualitative interviews), followed
      by a meta-inference process wherein results from analyses are synthesized.
      Results: Whereas most DCS globally target “recreational drug users,” in Toronto, 
      this networked DCS will primarily target marginalized people who use drugs
      accessing frontline services, many of whom use drugs regularly and by injection. 
      This evolution in the application of DCS poses important questions that have not 
      yet been explored, including optimal service delivery models and technologies, as
      well as unique barriers for this population. Increasing information on the
      unregulated drug supply may modify the risk environment for this population of
      people who use drugs. Conclusions: This study addresses evidence gaps on the
      emerging continuum of overdose prevention responses and will generate critical
      evidence on a novel approach to reducing the ongoing high incidence of
      drug-related morbidity and mortality in Canada and elsewhere.

TI  - Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the 3D-CAM Chinese version in
      surgical ICU patients.
LID - 133
AB  - Background: Accurate diagnosis of delirium is very important for prevention and
      treatment. Present study was designed to validate the 3-Minute Diagnostic
      Interview for CAM-defined Delirium Chinese version (3D-CAM-CN) in surgical ICU
      patients. Methods: In this prospective diagnostic study, the 3D-CAM was
      translated into Chinese with culture adaption. Two interviewers (Roles A and B)
      independently administrated 3D-CAM-CN assessment in adult patients from
      postoperative days 1 to day 3. At the meantime, a panel of psychiatrists
      diagnosed delirium according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders-fifth edition as the reference standard. The sensitivity and
      specificity were calculated to analyze the diagnostic character of the 3D-CAM-CN.
      Kappa coefficient was used to evaluate interrater reliability. Results: Two
      hundred forty-five adult patients were assessed for at least 2 days, resulting a 
      total of 647 paired-assessments. When compared with the reference standard, the
      sensitivity and specificity of the 3D-CAM-CN assessment were 87.2 and 96.7%,
      respectively, by Role A and 84.6 and 97.4%, respectively, by Role B, with good
      interrater reliability (Kappa coefficient = 0.82, P < 0.001). It also performed
      well in patients with mild cognitive impairment, with the sensitivity from 85.7
      to 100% and the specificity from 95.7 to 96.4%. Conclusion: Our results showed
      that the 3D-CAM-CN can be used as a reliable and accurate instrument for delirium
      assessment in surgical patients. Trial registration: This trail was approved by
      the Clinical Research Ethic Committee of Peking University First Hospital (No.
      2017–1321) and registered on Chinese clinical trial registry on July 6, 2017
      (ChiCTR-OOC-17011887).

TI  - Inhibitory Plasticity: From Molecules to Computation and Beyond.
LID - 1805
AB  - Synaptic plasticity is the cellular and molecular counterpart of learning and
      memory and, since its first discovery, the analysis of the mechanisms underlying 
      long-term changes of synaptic strength has been almost exclusively focused on
      excitatory connections. Conversely, inhibition was considered as a fixed
      controller of circuit excitability. Only recently, inhibitory networks were shown
      to be finely regulated by a wide number of mechanisms residing in their synaptic 
      connections. Here, we review recent findings on the forms of inhibitory
      plasticity (IP) that have been discovered and characterized in different brain
      areas. In particular, we focus our attention on the molecular pathways involved
      in the induction and expression mechanisms leading to changes in synaptic
      efficacy, and we discuss, from the computational perspective, how IP can
      contribute to the emergence of functional properties of brain circuits.

TI  - Disparity of health services in patients with knee osteoarthritis before total
      knee arthroplasty.
PG  - 81-7
AB  - Background: Recent evidence describes which interventions are driving insurance
      payments in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) before total knee arthroplasty 
      (TKA); however, relatively little is known about how these costs are distributed 
      among patients. Methods: We reviewed the Humana claims database for patients who 
      underwent primary TKA from 2009 to 2016. Insurance payments for treatment,
      imaging, and evaluation and management were calculated from OA diagnosis to TKA, 
      the distribution of payments was determined, and a high-payment group was
      identified by determining the point at which patients began to account for a
      disproportionate percentage of payments. This group of high-payment patients was 
      compared with remaining patients (low-payment patients) based on demographic
      factors and nonarthroplasty payments and utilization. Results: The top 30% of
      patients accounted for more than 70% of nonarthroplasty payments. High-payment
      patients were more likely to be younger, female, and more comorbid. Median time
      from diagnosis to TKA for high-payment patients was 3 times longer than that for 
      low-payment patients (654 days [320-1191] vs 204 days [68-582], P < .001), and
      median payment per patient was more than 5 times higher ($1891 [1405-2782] vs
      $362 [198-613], P < .001). Conclusions: Identification of high-payment patients
      in the management of knee OA may allow for targeted care pathways and
      cost-reduction strategies in the nonarthroplasty period, although additional
      studies are necessary to further characterize this population and efficiently
      recognize appropriate TKA candidates and timing.

TI  - Moderate to severe acute pain disturbs motor cortex intracortical inhibition and 
      facilitation in orthopedic trauma patients: A TMS study.
LID - e0226452
AB  - Objective: Primary motor (M1) cortical excitability alterations are involved in
      the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Less is known about M1-cortical 
      excitability implications in the acute phase of an orthopedic trauma. This study 
      aims to assess acute M1-cortical excitability in patients with an isolated upper 
      limb fracture (IULF) in relation to pain intensity. Methods: Eighty-four (56 IULF
      patients <14 days post-trauma and 28 healthy controls). IULF patients were
      divided into two subgroups according to pain intensity (mild versus moderate to
      severe pain). A single transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) session was
      performed over M1 to compare groups on resting motor threshold (rMT),
      short-intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and
      long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI). Results: Reduced SICI and ICF were
      found in IULF patients with moderate to severe pain, whereas mild pain was not
      associated with M1 alterations. Age, sex, and time since the accident had no
      influence on TMS measures. Discussion: These findings show altered M1 in the
      context of acute moderate to severe pain, suggesting early signs of altered
      GABAergic inhibitory and glutamatergic facilitatory activities.

TI  - Efficacy of a two bag acetylcysteine regimen to treat paracetamol overdose (2NAC 
      study).
LID - 100288
AB  - Background: Previous studies of paracetamol overdose treatment show that a 2-bag,
      20-h intravenous (IV) acetylcysteine regimen decreased the incidence of
      non-allergic anaphylactic reactions compared to the 3-bag, 21 h IV regimen, but
      have not examined efficacy of the 20-h 2 bag regimen. Methods: This was a
      multi-centre observational study of paracetamol overdose presentations treated
      with a 2-bag IV acetylcysteine regimen (200 mg/kg over 4 h, 100 mg/kg over 16 h) 
      compared to a 3-bag regimen, performed from 2009 to 2019. Patients were referred 
      from the emergency department to the inpatient toxicology units for continued
      management. For the primary non-inferiority analysis: subjects had single, acute 
      ingestions, a serum paracetamol-concentration performed 4 to 8-h post-ingestion. 
      The primary outcome was development of acute liver injury (ALI), defined as peak 
      ALT>150 U/L; and > double admission baseline ALT (for presentations within 24 h
      post-overdose). Secondary outcomes included adverse reactions to acetylcysteine
      (cutaneous and systemic). Finding: Out of 6419 paracetamol overdoses, 2763
      received acetylcysteine. For the primary analysis, 1003 received the 2-bag and
      783 the 3-bag acetylcysteine regimen. When presentation bloods were performed 4
      to 8-h post-overdose, 21 (3.1%) developed ALI with the 2-bag regimen vs 16 (2.9%)
      with the 3-bag regimen (Difference: 0.2%, 95%CI:-1.6 to 2.2). The incidence of
      hepatotoxicity was: 1.2% (n = 8) with the two-bag regimen and 1.6% (n = 9) with
      the three-bag regimen (Difference -0.4%, 95%CI -1.75, 0.91). When presentation
      bloods were performed 8 to 24-h post-overdose, 70 (21%) developed ALI with the
      2-bag regimen vs 46 (23%) with the 3-bag regimen (Difference: -2%, 95%CI -9.12 to
      5.36). There were significantly less cutaneous and systemic non-allergic
      anaphylactic reactions recorded after treatment with the two-bag than the
      three-bag regimen (1.3% [n = 17] and 7.1% [n = 65], Difference: -5.8%, 95%CI -7.6
      to -4.0, p < 0.0001), respectively. Interpretation: A two-bag intravenous
      acetylcysteine regimen was found to be non-inferior to the three-bag regimen with
      regards to efficacy in preventing acute liver injury for early presentations of
      paracetamol overdose. No important differences were seen for any other
      presentations. The two-bag regimen also decreased the incidence of both
      non-allergic anaphylactic reactions and gastrointestinal adverse events from
      acetylcysteine treatment. Funding: AW is funded by a National Health and Medical

      buprenorphine has been demonstrated to decrease opioid-related overdose deaths.
      In this study, we aimed to better understand ED clinicians’ attitudes toward the 
      initiation of buprenorphine treatment in the ED. Methods: We performed a
      mixed-methods study consisting of a survey of 174 ED clinicians (attending
      physicians, residents, and physician assistants) and semi-structured interviews
      with 17 attending emergency physicians at a tertiary-care academic hospital.
      Results: A total of 93 ED clinicians (53% of those contacted) completed the
      survey. While 80% of respondents agreed that buprenorphine should be administered
      in the ED for patients requesting treatment, only 44% felt that they were
      prepared to discuss medication for addiction treatment. Compared to clinicians
      with fewer than five years of practice, those with greater experience were less
      likely to approve of ED-initiated buprenorphine. In our qualitative analysis,
      physicians had differing perspectives on the role that the ED should play in
      treating OUD. Most physicians felt that a buprenorphine-based intervention in the
      ED would be feasible with institutional support, including training
      opportunities, protocol support within the electronic health record, counseling
      and support staff, and a robust referral system for outpatient follow-up.
      Conclusion: ED clinicians’ perception of buprenorphine varied by years of
      practice and training level. Most ED clinicians did not feel prepared to initiate
      buprenorphine in the ED. Qualitative interviews identified several addressable
      barriers to ED-initiated buprenorphine.

TI  - Ketamine Safety and Use in the Emergency Department for Pain and
      Agitation/Delirium: A Health System Experience.
PG  - 272-81
AB  - Introduction: Two protocols were developed to guide the use of subdissociative
      dose ketamine (SDDK) for analgesia and dissociative sedation ketamine for severe 
      agitation/excited delirium in the emergency department (ED). We sought to
      evaluate the safety of these protocols implemented in 18 EDs within a large
      health system. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review to evaluate all
      adult patients who received intravenous (IV) SDDK for analgesia and intramuscular
      (IM) dissociative sedation ketamine for severe agitation/excited delirium in 12
      hospital-based and six freestanding EDs over a one-year period from the protocol 
      implementation. We developed a standardized data collection form and used it to
      record patient information regarding ketamine use, concomitant medication use,
      and any comorbidities that could have impacted the incidence of adverse events.
      Results: Approximately 570,000 ED visits occurred during the study period. SDDK
      was used in 210 ED encounters, while dissociative sedation ketamine for severe
      agitation/excited delirium was used in 37 ED encounters. SDDK was used in 83%
      (15/18) of sites while dissociative sedation ketamine was used in 50% (9/18) of
      sites. Endotracheal intubation, non-rebreather mask, and nasal cannula ≥ four
      liters per minute were identified in one, five, and three patients, respectively.
      Neuropsychiatric adverse events were identified in 4% (9/210) of patients who
      received SDDK. Conclusion: Patients experienced limited neuropsychiatric adverse 
      events from SDDK. Additionally, dissociative sedation ketamine for severe
      agitation/excited delirium led to less endotracheal intubation than reported in
      the prehospital literature. The favorable safety profile of ketamine use in the
      ED may prompt further increases in usage.

TI  - Research on alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among sexual minority women: A
      global scoping review.
LID - e0229869
AB  - Until the 1980s, the limited research on alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among
      sexual minority women (SMW) focused on alcohol and used samples recruited from
      gay bars, resulting in inflated estimates of hazardous drinking. Over the past
      several decades the number of AOD studies with SMW has increased dramatically. To
      characterize this literature, we conducted a scoping review to answer the
      following questions: What do we know, and what are the gaps in research about AOD
      use among SMW? We searched multiple electronic databases (Medline [PubMed],
      CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Web of Science) for peer-reviewed research articles about
      AOD use among adult SMW published between January 1, 2000 and May 31, 2017. After
      duplicates were removed the search identified 4,204 articles. We reviewed the
      titles and abstracts and removed articles that did not meet inclusion criteria.
      We used full-text review of the remaining 229 articles to make a final
      determination regarding inclusion and we retained 181 articles for review.
      Although the quantity of AOD research with SMW has grown substantially, the great
      majority of studies have been conducted in the United States (US) and most focus 
      on hazardous drinking; relatively little research has focused on other drugs. In 
      addition, although there has been marked improvement in theories and methods used
      in this research, many gaps and limitations remain. Examples are the lack of
      longitudinal research; reliance on samples that tend to over-represent white,
      well-educated, and relatively young women; sparse attention to mechanisms
      underlying the disproportionately high rates of AOD use among SMW; and the
      absence of intervention research. In general, more high-quality research on SMW’s
      use of AODs is needed, but gaps and limitations are particularly large in
      non-western countries. Addressing these research gaps and limitations is
      essential for providing information that can be used to develop more effective
      prevention and early intervention strategies, as well as for informing policies
      that can help to reduce risky drinking and drug misuse among SMW.

TI  - Development of a Biodegradable Subcutaneous Implant for Prolonged Drug Delivery
      Using 3D Printing.
LID - 105
AB  - Implantable drug delivery devices offer many advantages over other routes of drug
      delivery. Most significantly, the delivery of lower doses of drug, thus,
      potentially reducing side-effects and improving patient compliance. Three
      dimensional (3D) printing is a flexible technique, which has been subject to
      increasing interest in the past few years, especially in the area of medical
      devices. The present work focussed on the use of 3D printing as a tool to
      manufacture implantable drug delivery devices to deliver a range of model
      compounds (methylene blue, ibuprofen sodium and ibuprofen acid) in two in vitro
      models. Five implant designs were produced, and the release rate varied,
      depending on the implant design and the drug properties. Additionally, a rate
      controlling membrane was produced, which further prolonged the release from the
      produced implants, signalling the potential use of these devices for chronic
      conditions.

TI  - Opioid-induced immunosuppression and carcinogenesis promotion theories create the
      newest trend in acute and chronic pain pharmacotherapy.
LID - e1554
AB  - Opioids are the main group of pharmacological agents used during the
      perioperative period and provide a sedative and analgesic component. The
      observations of opioid consumption in West Europe indicate that this group of
      drugs is widely used in chronic noncancer pain therapy.Nearly 20 years ago, the
      first publications indicating that opioids, as an element of perioperative
      pharmacotherapy in oncologic patients, increase the risk of tumor recurrence and 
      affect further prognosis were presented. The actual publications suggest that
      there are multifactorial, complex mechanisms underlying the immunological impact 
      and carcinogenesis promotion of opioids and that the intensity varies depending
      on the type of opioid. There are also questions about the immunosuppressive
      effects among patients receiving opioids in the treatment of chronic noncancer
      pain.The aim of the review article is to present information about the action of 
      opioids on the immune system in carcinogenic settings and to define the clinical 
      usefulness of this pharmacological phenomenon.

TI  - Toll-Like Receptor Responsiveness of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Young 
      Women with Dysmenorrhea.
PG  - 503-16
AB  - Purpose: Dysmenorrhea is a common disorder that substantially disrupts the lives 
      of young women. To determine whether there is evidence of activation of the
      innate immune system in dysmenorrhea and whether the degree of activation may be 
      used as a biomarker for pain, we compared the responsiveness of peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 or 4 stimulation. We also
      investigated whether this effect is modulated by the use of the oral
      contraceptive pill (OC). Patients and Methods: Fifty-six women aged 16–35 years, 
      with either severe or minimal dysmenorrhea, and use or non-use of the OC, were
      enrolled. PBMCs were collected on two occasions in a single menstrual cycle: the 
      menstrual phase and the mid-follicular phase. PBMCs were exposed to
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 agonist, and PAM3CSK4 (PAM), a TLR2 agonist, and
      the resulting interleukin-1beta (IL–1β) output was determined. Statistical
      analysis compared the EC50 between groups as a measure of TLR responsiveness of
      PBMCs. Results: The key finding following LPS stimulation was a pain effect of
      dysmenorrhea (p=0.042) that was independent of use or non-use of OC, and
      independent of day of testing. Women with dysmenorrhea showed a large 2.15-fold
      (95% CI −4.69, −0.09) increase in IL–1β release when compared with pain-free
      participants across both days. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate
      an ex vivo immune relationship in women with dysmenorrhea-related pelvic pain. It
      provides evidence for the potential of immune modulation as a novel
      pharmacological target for future drug development in the management of
      dysmenorrhea.

TI  - The Validity and Reliability of the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience
      Questionnaire (Version A) in Primiparous Women in Mashhad, Iran.
PG  - 110-7
AB  - Background:: Although pregnancy and childbirth are physiological processes, fear 
      of childbirth is a common problem that is often associated with requests for
      cesarean delivery. This study was undertaken to determine the validity and
      reliability of the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire A (W-DEQ
      [A]) primiparous women in Mashhad, Iran. Methods:: This study was conducted on
      220 primiparous women with a gestational age of 28-30 weeks referred to health
      centers in Mashhad. Using demographic questionnaire, Beck’s Anxiety Inventory,
      Beck’s Depression Inventory, and the W-DEQ (A), for determining the validity and 
      reliability of the W-DEQ (A), first two linguists translated the questionnaire
      into Persian; then, two other linguists translated the Persian version back into 
      English. The content validity of this version was then assessed by expert faculty
      members. The final version was sent to the questionnaire’s original developers
      (Klass Wijma and Barbro Wijma) and then used after their approval. Factor
      analysis was used to analyze the data. Results:: The result of actor analysis
      revealed six factors, forming 58.8% of the total variance. The reliability of
      this questionnaire was confirmed with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.84, and
      the fear of childbirth was found to be correlated with Beck’s anxiety (r=0.414)
      and depression (r=0.287) scores. Conclusion:: The W-DEQ (A) is a valid and
      reliable tool for measuring the fear of childbirth and is recommended to be used 
      for measuring the fear of childbirth among Iranian women.

TI  - Current State of Understanding of the Role of PACAP in the
      Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal Gonadotropin Functions of Mammals.
LID - 88
AB  - PACAP was discovered 30 years ago in Dr. Akira Arimura's laboratory. In the past 
      three decades since then, it has become evident that this peptide plays numerous 
      crucial roles in mammalian organisms. The most important functions of PACAP are
      the following: 1. neurotransmitter, 2. neuromodulator, 3. hypophysiotropic
      hormone, 4. neuroprotector. This paper reviews the accumulated data regarding the
      distribution of PACAP and its receptors in the mammalian hypothalamus and
      pituitary gland, the role of PACAP in the gonadotropin hormone secretion of
      females and males. The review also summarizes the interaction between PACAP,
      GnRH, and sex steroids as well as hypothalamic peptides including kisspeptin. The
      possible role of PACAP in reproductive functions through the biological clock is 
      also discussed. Finally, the significance of PACAP in the hypothalamo-hypophysial
      system is considered and the facts missing, that would help better understand the
      function of PACAP in this system, are also highlighted.

TI  - Functional Selectivity and Antinociceptive Effects of a Novel KOPr Agonist.
LID - 188
AB  - Kappa opioid receptor (KOPr) agonists represent alternative analgesics for their 
      low abuse potential, although relevant adverse effects have limited their
      clinical use. Functionally selective KOPr agonists may activate, in a
      pathway-specific manner, G protein-mediated signaling, that produces
      antinociception, over β-arrestin 2-dependent induction of p38MAPK, which
      preferentially contributes to adverse effects. Thus, functionally selective KOPr 
      agonists biased toward G protein-coupled intracellular signaling over
      β-arrestin-2-mediated pathways may be considered candidate therapeutics possibly 
      devoid of many of the typical adverse effects elicited by classic KOPr agonists. 
      Nonetheless, the potential utility of functionally selective agonists at opioid
      receptors is still highly debated; therefore, further studies are necessary to
      fully understand whether it will be possible to develop more effective and safer 
      analgesics by exploiting functional selectivity at KOPr. In the present study we 
      investigated in vitro functional selectivity and in vivo antinociceptive effects 
      of LOR17, a novel KOPr selective peptidic agonist that we synthesized.
      LOR17-mediated effects on adenylyl cyclase inhibition, ERK1/2, p38MAPK
      phosphorylation, and astrocyte cell proliferation were studied in HEK-293 cells
      expressing hKOPr, U87-MG glioblastoma cells, and primary human astrocytes; biased
      agonism was investigated via cAMP ELISA and β-arrestin 2 recruitment assays.
      Antinociception and antihypersensitivity were assessed in mice via warm-water
      tail-withdrawal test, intraperitoneal acid-induced writhing, and a model of
      oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic cold hypersensitivity. Effects of LOR17 on
      locomotor activity, exploratory activity, and forced-swim behavior were also
      assayed. We found that LOR17 is a selective, G protein biased KOPr agonist that
      inhibits adenylyl cyclase and activates early-phase ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
      Conversely to classic KOPr agonists as U50,488, LOR17 neither induces p38MAPK
      phosphorylation nor increases KOPr-dependent, p38MAPK-mediated cell proliferation
      in astrocytes. Moreover, LOR17 counteracts, in a concentration-dependent manner, 
      U50,488-induced p38MAPK phosphorylation and astrocyte cell proliferation. Both
      U50,488 and LOR17 display potent antinociception in models of acute nociception, 
      whereas LOR17 counteracts oxaliplatin-induced thermal hypersensitivity better
      than U50,488, and it is effective after single or repeated s.c. administration.
      LOR17 administered at a dose that fully alleviated oxaliplatin-induced thermal
      hypersensitivity did not alter motor coordination, locomotor and exploratory
      activities nor induced pro-depressant-like behavior. LOR17, therefore, may emerge
      as a novel KOPr agonist displaying functional selectivity toward G protein
      signaling and eliciting antinociceptive/antihypersensitivity effects in different
      animal models, including oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.

TI  - Concerned topics of epidural labor analgesia: labor elongation and maternal
      pyrexia: a systematic review.
PG  - 597-605
AB  - Objective:: Labor is a complex process and labor pain presents challenges for
      analgesia. Epidural analgesia (EA) has a well-known analgesic effect and is
      commonly used during labor. This review summarized frequently encountered and
      controversial problems surrounding EA during labor, including the labor process
      and maternal intrapartum fever, to build knowledge in this area. Data sources::
      We searched for relevant articles published up to 2019 in PubMed using a range of
      search terms (eg, “labor pain,” “epidural,” “analgesia,” “labor process,”
      “maternal pyrexia,” “intrapartum fever”). Study selection:: The search returned
      835 articles, including randomized control trials, retrospective cohort studies, 
      observational studies, and reviews. The articles were screened by title,
      abstract, and then full-text, with a sample independently screened by two
      authors. Thirty-eight articles were included in our final analysis; 20 articles
      concerned the labor process and 18 reported on maternal pyrexia during EA.
      Results:: Four classic prospective studies including 14,326 participants compared
      early and delayed initiation of EA by the incidence of cesarean delivery. Early
      initiation following an analgesia request was preferred. However, it was
      controversial whether continuous use of EA in the second stage of labor induced
      adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes due to changes in analgesic and epidural
      infusion regimens. There was a high incidence of maternal pyrexia in women
      receiving EA and women with placental inflammation or histologic chorioamnionitis
      compared with those receiving systemic opioids. Conclusions:: Early EA (cervical 
      dilation ≥1 cm) does not increase the risk for cesarean section. Continuous
      epidural application of low doses of analgesics and programmed intermittent
      epidural bolus do not prolong second-stage labor duration or impact maternal and 
      neonatal outcomes. The association between EA and maternal pyrexia remains
      controversial, but pyrexia is more common with EA than without. A non-infectious 
      inflammatory process is an accepted mechanism of epidural-related maternal fever.

TI  - A comparative study of three concentrations of intravenous nalbuphine combined
      with hydromorphone for post-cesarean delivery analgesia.
PG  - 523-9
AB  - Background:: Nalbuphine has been suggested to be used for post-cesarean section
      (CS) intravenous analgesia. However, ideal concentration of nalbuphine for such
      analgesia remains unclear. The present study was conducted to explore an ideal
      concentration of nalbuphine for post-CS intravenous analgesia by evaluating the
      analgesic effects and side-effects of three different concentrations of
      nalbuphine combined with hydromorphone for post-CS intravenous analgesia in
      healthy parturients. Methods:: One-hundred-and-fourteen parturients undergoing
      elective CS were randomly allocated to one of three groups (38 subjects per
      group) according to an Excel-generated random number sheet to receive
      hydromorphone 0.05 mg/mL + nalbuphine 0.5 mg/mL (group LN), hydromorphone 0.05
      mg/mL + nalbuphine 0.7 mg/mL (group MN), and hydromorphone 0.05 mg/mL +
      nalbuphine 0.9 mg/mL (group HN) using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump.
      Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, PCA bolus demands, cumulative PCA dose,
      satisfaction score, Ramsay score, and side-effects such as urinary retention were
      recorded. Results:: The number of PCA bolus demands and cumulative PCA dose
      during the first 48 h after CS were significantly higher in group LN (21 ± 16
      bolus, 129 ± 25 mL) than those in group MN (15 ± 10 bolus, 120 ± 16 mL) (both
      P < 0.05) and group HN (13 ± 9 bolus, 117 ± 13 mL) (both P < 0.01), but no
      difference was found between group HN and group MN (both P > 0.05). VAS scores
      were significantly lower in group HN than those in group MN and group LN for
      uterine cramping pain at rest and after breast-feeding within 12 h after CS (all 
      P < 0.01) and VAS scores were significantly higher in group LN than those in
      group MN and group HN when oxytocin was intravenously infused within 3 days after
      CS (all P < 0.05), whereas VAS scores were not statistically different among
      groups for incisional pain (all P > 0.05). Ramsay sedation scale score in group
      HN was significantly higher than that in group MN at 8 and 12 h after CS (all
      P < 0.01) and group LN at 4, 8, 12, 24 h after CS (all P < 0.05). Conclusions::
      Hydromorphone 0.05 mg/mL + nalbuphine 0.7 mg/mL for intravenous PCA could
      effectively improve the incisional pain and uterine cramping pain management and 
      improve comfort in patients after CS. Trial registration number::

TI  - Contact heat evoked potentials in knowledge workers and unskilled labors.
PG  - 537-41
AB  - Background:: Whether occupation has an impact on contact heat evoked potential
      (CHEP) results has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the
      difference of CHEP parameters between knowledge workers and unskilled labors.
      Methods:: A total of 137 healthy participants were recruited between November 20,
      2014 and December 31, 2016. All participants underwent neurologic examination,
      laboratory examination, and nerve conduction studies. CHEP was performed on four 
      body sites: the upper border of the distal third of the volar forearm, the upper 
      border of the distal third of the lateral leg, the spinous process of seventh
      cervical vertebrae (C7), and the spinous process of 12th thoracic vertebrae
      (T12). Independent t test and nonparametric test were performed using SPSS
      software to compare the difference of the CHEP parameters between knowledge
      workers and unskilled labors. Results:: The “N2 latency/height” (Z = −2.290,
      P = 0.022) and “P2 latency/height” (Z = −2.020, P = 0.043) on the volar forearm
      of unskilled labors significantly increased than those of knowledge workers. The 
      “N2 latency/height” (F = 6.348, P = 0.016) and “P2 latency/height” (F = 5.920,
      P = 0.018) in the distal leg of unskilled labors significantly prolonged than
      those of knowledge workers. The N2-P2 amplitude (F = 5.797, P = 0.020) in the
      distal leg of unskilled labors significantly decreased than those of knowledge
      workers. Conclusions:: Our study found that significantly prolonged N2 latency
      and P2 latency and significantly decreased N2-P2 amplitude in the distal leg and 
      the volar forearm in unskilled labors as to knowledge workers.

      0.08% with sufentanyl 0.3 μg/mL for labor analgesia: a biased-coin up-and-down
      sequential allocation trial.
PG  - 517-22
AB  - Background:: The programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB) technique is
      widely used in labor analgesia, but the parameter settings of PIEB have not yet
      been standardized. We designed a study to identify the optimal interval duration 
      for PIEB using 10 mL of ropivacaine 0.08% and sufentanyl 0.3 μg/mL, a regimen
      commonly used to control labor pain in China, to provide effective analgesia in
      90% of women during the first stage of labor without breakthrough pain. Methods::
      We conducted a double-blind sequential allocation trial to obtain the effective
      interval 90% (EI90%) during the first stage of labor between April 2019 and May
      2019. This study included the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical
      status II–III nulliparous parturients at term, who requested epidural analgesia. 
      The bolus volume was fixed at 10 mL of ropivacaine 0.08% with sufentanyl 0.3
      μg/mL. Participants were divided into four groups (groups 60, 50, 40, and 30)
      according to the PIEB intervals (60, 50, 40, and 30 min, respectively). The
      interval duration of the first parturient was set at 60 min and that of
      subsequent parturients varied according to a biased-coin design. The truncated
      Dixon and Mood method and the isotonic regression analysis method were used to
      estimate the EI90% and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results:: Forty-four
      women were enrolled in this study. The estimated optimal interval was 44.1 min
      (95% CI 41.7–46.5 min) and 39.5 min (95% CI 32.5–50.0 min), using the truncated
      Dixon and Mood method and isotonic regression analysis, respectively. The maximum
      sensory block level above T6 was in nearly 20% of parturients in group 30;
      however, 5.3%, 0%, and 0% of the parturients presented with sensory block level
      above T6 in groups 40, 50, and 60, respectively. There were no cases of
      hypotension and only one parturient complained of motor block. Conclusion:: With 
      a fixed 10 mL dose of ropivacaine 0.08% with sufentanyl 0.3 μg/mL, the optimal
      PIEB interval is about 42 min. Further studies are warranted to define the
      efficacy of this regimen throughout all stages of labor.Trial registration:

      critically ill patients at a Tertiary Saudi Hospital (ATTAINMENT Trial): study
      protocol for a randomized, prospective, pilot, feasibility trial.
LID - 288
AB  - Background: A noticeable interest in ketamine infusion for sedation management
      has developed among critical care physicians for critically ill patients. The
      2018 Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep disruption
      guideline suggested low-dose ketamine infusion as an adjunct to opioid therapy to
      reduce opioid requirements in post-surgical patients in the intensive care unit
      (ICU). This was, however, rated as conditional due to the very low quality of
      evidence. Ketamine has favorable characteristics, making it an especially viable 
      alternative for patients with respiratory and hemodynamic instability. The
      Analgo-sedative adjuncT keTAmine Infusion iN Mechanically vENTilated ICU patients
      (ATTAINMENT) trial aims to assess the effect and safety of adjunct low-dose
      continuous infusion of ketamine as an analgo-sedative compared to standard of
      care in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) for ≥ 24 h.
      Methods/design: This trial is a prospective, randomized, active controlled,
      open-label, pilot, feasibility study of adult ICU patients (> 14 years old) on
      MV. The study will take place in the adult ICUs in the King Faisal Specialist
      Hospital and Research Center (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and will enroll 80 
      patients. Patients will be randomized post-intubation into two groups: the
      intervention group will receive an adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of
      ketamine plus standard of care. Ketamine will be administered over a period of
      48 h at a fixed infusion rate of 2 μg/kg/min (0.12 mg/kg/h) in the first 24 h
      followed by 1 μg/kg/min (0.06 mg/kg/h) in the second 24 h. The control group will
      receive standard of care in the ICU (propofol and/or fentanyl and/or midazolam)
      according to the KFSH&RC sedation and analgesia protocol as clinically
      appropriate. The primary outcome is MV duration until ICU discharge, death,
      extubation, or 28 days post-randomization, whichever comes first. Discussion: The
      first patient was enrolled on 1 September 2019. As of 10 October 2019, a total of
      16 patients had been enrolled. We expect to complete the recruitment by 31
      December 2020. The findings of this pilot trial will likely justify further
      investigation for the role of adjunct low-dose ketamine infusion as an
      analgo-sedative agent in a larger, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

TI  - In their own words: a qualitative study of factors promoting resilience and
      recovery among postpartum women with opioid use disorders.
LID - 178
AB  - Background: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with substantial morbidity
      and mortality for women, especially during the perinatal period. Opioid overdose 
      has become a significant cause of maternal death in the United States, with rates
      highest in the immediate postpartum year. While pregnancy is a time of high
      motivation for healthcare engagement, unique challenges exist for pregnant women 
      with OUD seeking both substance use treatment and maternity care, including
      managing change after birth. How women successfully navigate these barriers,
      engage in treatment, and abstain from substance use during pregnancy and
      postpartum is poorly understood. The aim of this study is to explore the
      experiences of postpartum women with OUD who successfully engaged in both
      substance use treatment and maternity care during pregnancy, to understand
      factors contributing to their ability to access care and social support. Methods:
      We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with postpartum women in
      sustained recovery (n = 10) engaged in a substance use treatment program in
      northern New England. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory methodology.
      Results: Despite multiple barriers, women identified pregnancy as a change point 
      from which they were able to develop self-efficacy and exercise agency in seeking
      care. A shift in internal motivation enabled women to disclose need for OUD
      treatment to maternity care providers, a profoundly significant moment.
      Concurrently, women developed a new capacity for self-care, demonstrated through 
      managing relationships with providers and family members, and overcoming
      logistical challenges which had previously seemed overwhelming. This
      transformation was also expressed in making decisions based on pregnancy risk,
      engaging with and caring for others, and providing peer support. Women developed 
      resilience through the interaction of inner motivation and their ability to
      positively utilize or transform external factors. Conclusions: Complex
      interactions occurred between individual-level changes in treatment motivation
      due to pregnancy, emerging self-efficacy in accessing resources, and engagement
      with clinicians and peers. This transformative process was identified by women as
      a key factor in entering recovery during pregnancy and sustaining it postpartum. 
      Clinicians and policymakers should target the provision of services which promote
      resilience in pregnant women with OUD.

TI  - The median effective dose (ED50) of cis-Atracurium for laryngeal mask airway
      insertion during general Anaesthesia for patients undergoing urinary surgery.
LID - 68
AB  - Background: In clinical practice, the laryngeal mask airway is an easy-to-use
      supraglottic airway device. However, the cis-atracurium dosage for laryngeal mask
      insertion has not been standardised. We aimed to determine the optimal dose of
      cis-atracurium using a sequential method for successful laryngeal mask insertion.
      Methods: The cohort study protocol is registered at clinicaltrial.gov
      (NCT-03668262). Twenty-three patients undergoing elective urinary surgery were
      sequentially administered cis-atracurium doses as follows: 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 
      and 20 μg·kg− 1. The main outcome involved the determination of the response to
      laryngeal mask airway insertion: ≥16 points and < 16 points indicated
      “satisfactory” and “unsatisfactory” responses, respectively. The median effective
      dose was estimated using the mean of the seven crossovers from “satisfactory” and
      “unsatisfactory” responses. The primary outcome involved the determination of the
      median effective dose (ED50) of cis-atracurium for laryngeal mask airway
      insertion. Results: The median effective dose of cis-atracurium was 26.5 μg·kg− 1
      (95% CI 23.6–29.8) using the sequential method. Heart rate was decreased in the
      50 μg·kg− 1 group compared to that in the 30 μg·kg− 1 group at timepoints T7, T8,
      and T10 (P = 0.0482, P = 0.0460, and P = 0.0236, respectively), but no difference
      was observed in the 20 μg·kg− 1 group. Systolic blood pressure was decreased in
      the 50 μg·kg− 1 group compared to that in the 20 μg·kg− 1 group at timepoints T2,
      T3, and T4 (P = 0.0159, P = 0.0233, and P = 0.0428, respectively). The
      train-of-four value was significantly lower in the 50 μg·kg− 1 group than in the 
      30 μg·kg− 1 group at timepoint T3 (P = 0.0326). Conclusions: The ED50 of
      cis-atracurium was 26.5 μg·kg− 1 for laryngeal mask airway insertion. Trial

TI  - Opioid drug use in emergency and adverse outcomes among patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease: a multicenter observational study.
LID - 5038
AB  - There is still debate as to the safety of non-palliative opioid administration to
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients punctually treated for an
      acute complaint. All patients over 40 presenting at two university hospital
      emergency departments (Montréal Qc, Grenoble Fr) from March 2008 to September
      2014 with dyspnea, abdominal pain or trauma were retrieved, and COPD patients
      were selected. Our primary endpoint was a composite criterion including invasive 
      ventilation and death. Comparisons between visits in which opioid drugs were
      prescribed and those without opioids were performed using an inverse probability 
      of treatment and censoring weight (IPTCW) estimator to adjust for baseline
      confounders. A survival weighted Cox model was used. 7799 visits by COPD patients
      were identified, corresponding to 4173 unique patients. Opioid drug prescription 
      was reported in 1317 (16.9%) visits. After applying IPCTW weighting, opioid
      prescription was found to be associated with the composite criterion of poor
      clinical outcomes (HR = 4.73 (2.94; 7.61), p < 0.01). When taken separately, this
      association remained significant for invasive ventilation and death, but not for 
      NIV. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the association, except for patients with
      trauma or abdominal pain as the main complaint. This excess risk is observed
      whatever the route of administration.

TI  - Surgical intervention for malignant bowel obstruction caused by gastrointestinal 
      malignancies.
PG  - 323-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a common event for end-stage
      gastrointestinal cancer patients. Previous studies had demonstrated
      manifestations and clinical management of MBO with mixed malignancies. There
      still lack reports of the surgical treatment of MBO. AIM: To analyze the
      short-term outcomes and prognosis of palliative surgery for MBO caused by
      gastrointestinal cancer. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 61 patients
      received palliative surgery between January 2016 to October 2018 was performed,
      of which 31 patients underwent massive debulking surgery (MDS) and 30 underwent
      ostomy/by-pass surgery (OBS). The 60-d symptom palliation rate, 30-d morbidity
      and mortality, and overall survival rates were compared between the two groups.
      RESULTS: The overall symptom palliation rate was 75.4% (46/61); patients in the
      MDS group had significantly higher symptom palliation rate than OBS group (90% vs
      61.2%, P = 0.016). Patients with colorectal cancer who were in the MDS group
      showed significantly higher symptom improvement rates compared to the OBS group
      (overall, 76.4%; MDS, 61.5%; OBS, 92%; P = 0.019). However, patients with gastric
      cancer did not show a significant difference in symptom palliation rate between
      the MDS and OBS groups (OBS, 60%; MDS, 80%; P = 1.0). The median survival time in
      the MDS group was significantly longer than in the OBS group (10.9 mo vs 5.3 mo, 
      P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: For patients with MBO caused by peritoneal metastatic
      colorectal cancer, MDS can improve symptom palliation rates and prolong survival,
      without increasing mortality and morbidity rates.

      arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PG  - 195-204
AB  - Background/aim: To determine the effectiveness of pregabalin and adductor canal
      block on opioid consumption, postoperative pain, and fast-tracking. Materials and
      methods: A total of 51 American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA)
      classification I–II patients aged 18–70 years who were scheduled to undergo
      elective anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were included in the study.
      Patients were randomized into groups P, A, and C. Patients in group P (n = 16),
      received 150 mg of preoperative oral pregabalin, patients in group A (n = 17)
      received postoperative adductor canal blockade, and patients in group C (n = 18) 
      received neither adductor canal block nor pregabalin. Surgeries were performed
      under spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine following monitorization.
      Demographic data along with block features, hemodynamic data, mean opioid
      consumption, numerical rating scale score, White’s fast-track score, and
      postoperative adverse effects were recorded. Results: Fifty-seven patients were
      enrolled in the study, and 6 patients were excluded from the study; the data of
      51 patients were included in the final analyses. Demographic characteristics and 
      hemodynamic data were similar between the 3groups. Postoperative opioid
      consumption was significantly lower in groups A and P compared with group C
      (group P = 178.75 mg, group C = 318.61 mg, group A = 236.47 mg; P < 0.05). The
      regression of sensory block was significantly slower in group P (P < 0.05). The
      first analgesic requirement was earlier in group C than in groups P and A (P <
      0.05). Patients in group P had higher fast-track scores at 8 h and 12 h compared 
      with group C (P < 0.05); however, group A fast-track scores were similar to those
      of the other 2groups (P > 0.05). The rate of postoperative adverse effects was
      similar between the groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Preoperative pregabalin (150
      mg) reduced postoperative opioid consumption as much as adductor canal block in
      patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The first
      analgesic requirement was earlier in group C than in groups P and A. In addition,
      pregabalin can prolong the duration of spinal sensory block and shorten the time 
      required to achieve high fast-tracking scores. We recommend the use of both
      methods as a part of multimodal analgesia.

TI  - Independent prescribing by advanced physiotherapists for patients with low back
      pain in primary care: A feasibility trial with an embedded qualitative component.
LID - e0229792
AB  - Background: Low back pain (LBP) is the most prevalent musculoskeletal condition. 
      Guidelines advocate a multimodal approach, including prescription of medications.
      Advanced Physiotherapy Practitioners (APPs) are well placed to manage LBP. To
      date no trial has evaluated the efficacy of physiotherapist-prescribing for LBP. 
      Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility, suitability and acceptability of
      assessing the effectiveness of physiotherapist-prescribing for LBP in primary
      care; informing the design of a future definitive stepped-wedged cluster trial
      (SWcRCT). Methods: Mixed-methods, single-arm feasibility design with two
      components.1) Trial component: participants with medium-risk LBP +/-leg pain were
      recruited across 3 sites. Outcome measures (primary outcome measures-Pain/RMDQ)
      were completed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks Physical activity/sedentary behaviour 
      were assessed over 7 days using accelerometery. A CONSORT diagram analysed
      recruitment/follow-up rates. Descriptive analysis evaluated
      procedure/floor-effects.2) Embedded qualitative component: focus groups (n = 6)
      and semi-structured interviews (n = 3) evaluated the views/experiences of
      patients and APPs about feasibility/suitability/acceptability of the proposed
      trial. Thematic analysis synthesised the qualitative data. Findings were
      evaluated against a priori success criteria. Results: n = 29 participants were
      recruited. 90% of success criteria were met. Loss to follow-up at 12 weeks
      (65.5%) did not satisfy success criteria. Primary and secondary outcome measures 
      were suitable and acceptable with no floor effects. The addition of a sleep
      assessment tool was advised. Accelerometer use was acceptable with 100%
      adherence. APPs felt all patients presenting with non-specific LBP +/- leg pain
      and capture data representative of the full scope of physiotherapist independent 
      prescribing should be included. Data collection methods were acceptable to APPs
      and patients. APPs advocated necessity for using research assistants owing to
      time limitations. Conclusions: Methods evaluated are feasible, suitable and
      acceptable for a definitive SWcRCT, with modification of eligibility criteria,
      and use of research assistants to overcome limited clinician capacity. A
      definitive SWcRCT is feasible with minor modifications. Registration:
      ISRCTN15516596.

TI  - Early Recurrence of Ovarian Cancer during Pregnancy after Primary Staging Surgery
      in the First Trimester.
LID - 1737061
AB  - Cancer during pregnancy is rare. However, even during pregnancy, there is the
      possibility of recurrence for the patients. We present the case of recurrence of 
      ovarian cancer during pregnancy regardless of primary staging surgery performed
      in the first trimester of the same pregnancy. The patient was a 29-year-old woman
      who underwent fertility-sparing surgery at 15 weeks of pregnancy for ovarian
      cancer (mucinous adenocarcinoma, FIGO stage IC). Omitting adjuvant chemotherapy
      during pregnancy, we continued the prenatal checkups in the outpatient. At 31
      weeks of gestation, massive ascites emerged and oliguria/anuria developed
      acutely. We performed emergent cesarean section, diagnosing acute kidney injury
      during pregnancy. On surgical finding, there were a number of 1 cm sized nodules 
      in the small bowel wall and peritoneum. The infant was appropriate for
      gestational age without any abnormalities. Oliguria continued due to rapid
      accumulation of ascites in the early postpartum period. After two cycles of
      chemotherapy, ascites decreased gradually and the markers gradually decreased.
      However, after six courses of chemotherapy, she suddenly complained of nausea and
      anorexia. CT imaging showed cancerous ileus and ascites fluids. The patient chose
      palliative care. Even in the case of nonadvanced cancer, it has the potential to 
      be an extremely aggressive malignancy under the irregular hormonal environment of
      pregnancy.

TI  - Differences between pharmacists’ perception of counseling and practice in the era
      of prescription drug misuse.
LID - 1682
AB  - Objective:: This study was conducted to assess pharmacists’ practices when
      counseling patients on their prescription medications, and their preferences for 
      training. Methods:: Five focus group discussions of community pharmacists (n=45, 
      with seven to eleven participants in each group) were conducted in a major
      metropolitan city in the southern United States. Participants were recruited via 
      email using a list of community pharmacists provided by the Texas State Board of 
      Pharmacy. All focus group discussions were structured using a moderator guide
      consisting of both discrete and open-ended questions. Qualitative analysis
      software was used to analyze the data with a thematic analysis approach.
      Results:: The participants in this study had a high self-efficacy regarding their
      ability to counsel on both new and opioid prescriptions. Many pharmacists
      experienced the same barriers to counseling and agreed on the components of
      counseling. However, the themes that emerged showed that the participants
      exhibited only a partial understanding of the components of counseling. The
      themes that emerged in the thematic analysis were perceived confidence and
      discordant counseling practices, inadequate infrastructure, lack of comprehensive
      counseling, inconsistent use of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), 
      and pharmacists’ desired training/assistance. Conclusions:: Community pharmacists
      are in a unique position to help combat the opioid crisis; however, there has
      been very little research on the pharmacist-patient interaction in this context. 
      With policy changes, such as the PDMP mandate, going into effect across the
      country, it is important to capitalize on the potential community pharmacists
      have in ameliorating the opioid crisis in the United States.

TI  - The effect of ginger and metoclopramide in the prevention of nausea and vomiting 
      during and after surgery in cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.
PG  - 173-80
AB  - Objective: Postoperative nausea and vomiting is one of the most common side
      effects after anesthesia in surgeries, such as cesarean section. This study aimed
      to investigate the effect of ginger and metoclopramide in the prevention of
      nausea and vomiting during and after cesarean section. Methods: This clinical
      trial was conducted on 180 patients aged 18–40 years who underwent cesarean
      section under spinal anesthesia. The first group received 10 mg of metoclopramide
      via intravenous injection (metoclopramide group), and the second group received 1
      g of oral ginger (ginger group) half an hour before spinal anesthesia. The
      frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting during surgery and at 2, 6, 12, and
      24 hours postoperatively were compared in both groups. To analyze the results,
      the t-test, chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney test were used. Results: There was 
      no significant difference in the frequency of nausea and vomiting between the 2
      groups during operation, 2 hours and 6 hours after surgery (P=0.182, 0.444 and
      0.563 respectively). The severity of nausea and vomiting was also similar in the 
      2 groups (P=0.487 and 0.652 respectively); however, the metoclopramide group had 
      a lower systolic blood pressure (P<0.001; df=2.176; f=18.66) and mean arterial
      pressure (P<0.001; df=2.176; f=6.36) than the ginger group. Conclusion: The
      results revealed that ginger reduced nausea and vomiting to the same extent as
      metoclopramide in patients undergoing cesarean section. Trial Registration:

TI  - Trauma-affected refugees treated with basic body awareness therapy or mixed
      physical activity as augmentation to treatment as usual—A pragmatic randomised
      controlled trial.
LID - e0230300
AB  - Background: The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is estimated 
      to be as high as 30% among refugees. The coexistence of prevalent chronic pain is
      believed to maintain symptoms of PTSD and add complexity to the condition.
      Despite this, little evidence exists on how to treat PTSD and comorbid conditions
      best in trauma-affected refugees. Aim: The aim of the present study was to
      investigate if adding either BBAT or mixed physical activity to the treatment as 
      usual (TAU) for trauma-affected refugees with PTSD would increase the treatment
      effect compared to TAU alone. Method: Randomised controlled trial, 3-armed
      parallel group superiority study, conducted at Competence Centre for
      Transcultural Psychiatry, Denmark. Participants were adult trauma-affected
      refugees with PTSD. Allocation ratio was 1:1:1, stratified for PTSD severity and 
      gender. An open-label design was applied due to the nature of the intervention.
      Participants were randomised to receive either individual basic body awareness
      therapy (group B) or individual mixed physical activity (group M) one hour/week
      for 20 weeks plus TAU, or TAU only (group C). The primary outcome was PTSD
      severity measured by Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Trial registration:
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01955538. Results: Of the 338 patients included (C/B/M =
      110/114/114), 318 patients were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis (C/B/M =
      104/105/109). On the primary outcome, intention-to-treat as well as per-protocol 
      analyses showed small but significant improvement on scores from pre- to
      post-treatment in all three groups but with no significant difference in
      improvement between groups. Conclusions: The findings do not provide evidence
      that either BBAT or mixed physical activity as add-on treatment bring
      significantly larger improvement on symptoms of PTSD compared to TAU alone for
      adult, trauma-affected refugees. There is a need for studies on potential
      subpopulations of trauma-affected refugees who could benefit from physical
      activity as a part of their treatment.

TI  - A signal demodulation-based method for the early detection of Cheyne-Stokes
      respiration.
LID - e0221191
AB  - Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) is a sleep-disordered breathing characterized by 
      recurrent central apneas alternating with hyperventilation exhibiting a
      crescendo-decrescendo pattern of tidal volume. This respiration is reported in
      patients with heart failure, stroke or damage in respiratory centers. It
      increases mortality for patients with severe heart failure as it has adverse
      impacts on the cardiac function. Early stage of CSR, also called periodic
      breathing, is often undiagnosed as it only provokes hypopneas instead of apneas, 
      which are much more difficult to detect. This paper demonstrates the proof of
      concept of a new method devoted to the early detection of CSR. The proposed
      approach relies on a signal demodulation technique applied to ventilation signals
      measured on 15 patients with chronic heart failure whose respiration goes from
      normal to severe CSR. Based on a modulation index and its instantaneous
      frequency, oscillation zones are detected and classified into three categories:
      CSR, periodic breathing and no abnormal pattern. The modulation index is used as 
      an efficient indicator to quantify the degree of certainty of the pathology for
      each patient. Results show high correlation with experts’ annotations with
      sensitivity and specificity values of 87.1% and 89.8% respectively. A final
      decision leads to a classification which is confirmed by the experts’
      conclusions.

TI  - The burden of headache following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a
      prospective single-center cross-sectional analysis.
PG  - 893-903
AB  - Background: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as a serious type of stroke 
      is frequently accompanied by a so-called initial thunderclap headache. However,
      the occurrence of burdensome long-term headache following SAH has never been
      studied in detail so far. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence
      and characteristics of long-term burdensome headache in good-grade SAH patients
      as well as its relation to health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Methods: All 
      SAH cases treated between January 2014 and December 2016 with preserved
      consciousness at hospital discharge were prospectively interviewed regarding
      burdensome headache in 2018. Study participants were subsequently scrutinized by 
      means of a standardized postal survey comprising validated pain and HR-QOL
      questionnaires. A retrospective chart review provided data on the initial
      treatment. Results: A total of 93 out of 145 eligible SAH patients participated
      in the study (62 females). A total of 41% (38/93) of subjects indicated
      burdensome headache at follow-up (mean 32.6 ± 9.3 months). Comparison between
      patients with (HA+) and without long-term headache (HA-) revealed significantly
      younger mean age (47.9 ± 11.8 vs. 55.6 ± 10.3 years; p < .01) as well as more
      favorable neurological conditions (WFNS I/II: 95% vs. 75%; p = .03) in HA+ cases.
      The mean average headache of the HA+ group was 3.7 ± 2.3 (10-point numeric rating
      scale), and the mean maximum headache intensity was 5.7 ± 2.9. Pain and HR-QOL
      scores demonstrated profound alterations in HA+ compared to HA- patients.
      Conclusions: Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of SAH patients
      suffers from burdensome headache even years after the hemorrhage. Moreover,
      long-term headache is associated with reduced HR-QOL in these cases. Electronic

TI  - Restoration of Cyclo-Gly-Pro-induced salivary hyposecretion and submandibular
      composition by naloxone in mice.
LID - e0229761
AB  - Cyclo-Gly-Pro (CGP) attenuates nociception, however its effects on salivary
      glands remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the acute effects of CGP on
      salivary flow and composition, and on the submandibular gland composition,
      compared with morphine. Besides, we characterized the effects of naloxone (a
      non-selective opioid receptor antagonist) on CGP- and morphine-induced salivary
      and glandular alterations in mice. After that, in silico analyses were performed 
      to predict the interaction between CGP and opioid receptors. Morphine and CGP
      significantly reduced salivary flow and total protein concentration of saliva and
      naloxone restored them to the physiological levels. Morphine and CGP also reduced
      several infrared vibrational modes (Amide I, 1687-1594cm-1; Amide II,
      1594-1494cm-1; CH2/CH3, 1488-1433cm-1; C = O, 1432-1365cm-1; PO2 asymmetric,
      1290-1185cm-1; PO2 symmetric, 1135-999cm-1) and naloxone reverted these
      alterations. The in silico docking analysis demonstrated the interaction of polar
      contacts between the CGP and opioid receptor Cys219 residue. Altogether, we
      showed that salivary hypofunction and glandular changes elicited by CGP may occur
      through opioid receptor suggesting that the blockage of opioid receptors in
      superior cervical and submandibular ganglions may be a possible strategy to
      restore salivary secretion while maintaining antinociceptive action due its
      effects on the central nervous system.

TI  - Once-Monthly Long-Acting Injectable Aripiprazole for the Treatment of Patients
      with Schizophrenia and Co-occurring Substance Use Disorders: A Multicentre,
      Observational Study.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and impact of long-acting injectable (LAI)
      aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia with a coexisting substance use
      disorder (SUD). Patients and methods: A multicenter, observational, descriptive
      and retrospective study was conducted in patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of
      schizophrenia who had a coexisting SUD and were treated with LAI-aripiprazole.
      Disease severity was evaluated with the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity
      scale for schizophrenia, daily functioning and disability were evaluated with the
      World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS-2.0), and the
      severity of the addiction was evaluated with the Severity of Dependence Scale
      (SDS). Results: The sample included 40 patients. Overall, after 6 months of
      treatment with LAI-aripiprazole at a dose of 400 mg/4 weeks in 77.5% of the
      patients, we observed significant improvement in the psychopathological symptoms,
      with a reduction of over 30% in the scores of the five CGI-severity scales. The
      WHODAS-2.0 mean (standard deviation) score was also significantly reduced from
      57.6 (8.2) to 42.3 (4.3) points (p < 0.001). Regarding SUDs, after 6 months of
      treatment, substance use was stopped in 5 of the 9 patients with cocaine use
      disorder and in 3 of the 16 patients with alcohol abuse disorder. A significant
      reduction in the severity of the dependence was observed only in the subgroups of
      participants with cocaine and alcohol use disorders. Conclusion: Our study
      suggests that once-monthly LAI-aripiprazole retains its antipsychotic efficacy in
      patients with schizophrenia and a coexisting SUD and could be useful for the
      management of cocaine or alcohol use disorders in this population.

TI  - Efficacy of Tuina in patients with chronic low back pain: study protocol for a
      randomized controlled trial.
LID - 271
AB  - Background: Low back pain is a common reason for medical care and carries a heavy
      social burden. The efficacy of Tuina or health care education for low back pain
      has been evaluated in previous systematic reviews. However, there is no evidence 
      to support the superiority of one form of treatment over another. The aim of this
      study is to compare the efficacy of Tuina with health care education in the
      management of low back pain. Methods/design: This study is a randomized
      controlled trial with parallel-group design including two groups: a Tuina group
      and a health care education group. A total of 160 eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to the groups in a 1:1 ratio. The interventions of both groups 
      will last for 20 min and be carried out twice each week for a period of 12 weeks.
      The primary outcome is the Oswestry Disability Index. The secondary outcomes
      include a visual analogue scale and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey. They
      will be assessed at baseline, at the end of the intervention every month, and
      during 6 months and 9 months of follow-up by repeated measures analysis of
      variance. The significance level is 5%. The safety of Tuina and health care
      education will be evaluated after each treatment session. This study will focus
      on the value of Tuina and health care education for low back pain and will
      highlight any differences in the efficacy of the treatments. Discussion: This
      study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tuina intervention for low back
      pain, which could provide reliable evidence for clinical decision making for
      patients with low back pain. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry,

TI  - Evidence, theory and context: using intervention mapping in the development of a 
      community-based self-management program for chronic low back pain in a rural
      African primary care setting - the good back program.
LID - 343
AB  - Background: Rural Nigeria has one of the greatest burdens of low back pain but
      there are no effective evidence-based interventions to manage it in this
      population. This paper presents the application of the intervention mapping (IM) 
      approach in the development of a complex behavior change intervention – The Good 
      Back program, aimed at reducing non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP)
      disability in rural Nigeria. Methods: The first four steps of IM were applied. A 
      critical review of the literature, 2 qualitative studies and a population-based
      cross-sectional study in rural Nigeria helped to identify two key program
      objectives in order to reduce CLBP disability in this population: reduce the
      impact of illness perceptions, fear avoidance beliefs, catastrophising, anxiety
      and depression by targeting maladaptive illness perceptions about CLBP; and
      facilitate the adoption of exercises and good posture to limit disability. A
      systematic review plus these studies, identified the personal and environmental
      determinants of the performance objectives including health literacy,
      self-awareness, self-efficacy, personal preference, health professional skills,
      health facility structure and family/community support. The theory, techniques
      and strategies for modifying personal and environmental determinants were also
      identified from these studies. Intervention components and materials were then
      produced for practical application. The initial developed intervention was
      described. Results: The feasibility and acceptability of the developed program
      was then tested using a small pragmatic non-randomised controlled study
      incorporating qualitative exit feedback interviews in a rural Nigerian primary
      health care centre. The program appeared feasible and acceptable when delivered
      by a highly trained physiotherapist. There were promising clinical outcomes in
      disability, pain intensity, illness perceptions, fear avoidance beliefs and pain 
      medication use. Suggestions for program improvement included shorter but ongoing 
      sessions, video demonstration of exercises/good posture, spacious
      exercise/demonstration rooms, and community legitimisation of exercise as
      treatment for back pain. Subsequent modifications to program content and delivery
      were then described. Theoretical modification included the addition of aspects of
      the social cognitive theory to the Leventhal’s self-regulatory model of illness
      cognitions. Conclusions: IM appears to be a suitable framework for designing
      complex behavior change interventions in rural Nigeria. The need for further
      testing of the intervention was highlighted.

TI  - PTSD and opioid use: implications for intervention and policy.
LID - 22
AB  - Background: North America remains in the midst of an escalating opioid overdose
      epidemic, largely driven by the influx of synthetic opioids such a fentanyl and
      related analogues. High rates of mental illness among substance-using populations
      have been well documented; in particular, opioid-using individuals suffer from
      high rates of PTSD. Despite the devastating disease burden of both PTSD and OUD, 
      especially within the context of the current opioid overdose epidemic, treatment 
      options and outcomes remain suboptimal. Main body: Comorbid PTSD-OUD is often
      complex and inextricably intertwined, thereby impeding effective diagnosis,
      assessment and early intervention. Best outcomes occur when treatment addresses
      both comorbidities simultaneously, known as parallel or integrative approaches.
      Despite these findings, affected individuals often do not receive adequate or
      equitable access to healthcare. The WHO recommends that public spending for both 
      mental and physical aspects of healthcare be equitable to the burden of disease. 
      Despite these recommendations mental healthcare services remain chronically
      underfunded in Canada. The Mental Health Parity Act is a call for the Canadian
      government to implement equitable public spending on all aspects of healthcare.
      Furthermore, prohibitory legislative practices serve to marginalize
      substance-using populations thereby increasing the likelihood of exposure to
      traumatic violence and other associated harms. Conclusion: Efforts are now needed
      to address regulatory drug-use frameworks and public healthcare policies that
      perpetuate these inequalities. Alternative regulatory frameworks for drugs and
      mental health parity should be implemented and evaluated in an effort to reduce
      violence, trauma and ultimately opioid-related overdose deaths.

TI  - Phase II double-blind randomised controlled trial of exogenous administration of 
      melatonin in chronic pain (DREAM—CP): a study protocol.
LID - e034443
AB  - Introduction: Chronic pain is prevalent, and approximately half of patients with 
      chronic pain experience sleep disturbance. Exogenous melatonin is licensed to
      treat primary insomnia and there is some evidence for analgesic effects of
      melatonin.The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of oral melatonin
      (as Circadin) 2 mg at night in adults with severe non-malignant pain of at least 
      3 months’ duration. Methods and analysis: We will conduct a randomised
      double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study. The primary outcome is sleep
      disturbance. Secondary outcomes are pain intensity, actigraphy, fatigue, reaction
      time testing, serum melatonin and endogenous opioid peptide levels along with
      patient views about study participation.We aim to recruit 60 patients with severe
      chronic pain (average pain intensity ≥7 on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)) from a
      tertiary referral pain clinic in Northeast Scotland. Participants will be
      randomised to receive melatonin (as modified release Circadin) 2 mg daily for
      6 weeks or placebo, followed by a 4-week washout period, then 6 weeks treatment
      with the treatment they did not receive. Participants will complete the Verran
      Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Pain and Sleep
      Questionnaire 3-item index, BPI and psychomotor vigilance reaction time testing
      at 6 points over 20 weeks. Actigraphy watches will be used to provide objective
      measures of sleep duration and latency and other sleep measures and will prompt
      patients to report contemporaneous pain and fatigue scores daily.Cross-over
      analyses will include tests for effects of treatment, period, treatment–period
      interaction (carryover effect) and sequence. Within-patient effects and
      longitudinal data will be analysed using mixed linear models, accounting for
      potential confounders. Ethics and dissemination: Approved by Office for Research 
      Ethics Committees Northern Ireland, reference 19/NI/0007. Results will be
      published in peer-reviewed journals and will be presented at national and
      international conferences. Trial registration number: ISRCTN12861060

TI  - Antinociceptive effect of intrathecal injection of miR-9-5p modified mouse bone
      marrow mesenchymal stem cells on a mouse model of bone cancer pain.
LID - 85
AB  - Background: A growing body of studies have indicated that bone marrow mesenchymal
      stem cells (BMSCs) have powerful analgesic effects in animal models of bone
      cancer pain. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying how BMSCs
      alleviate pain sensation in a mouse model of bone cancer pain. Methods: C3H/HeN
      adult male mice were used to generate a bone cancer pain model. BMSCs were
      isolated from mouse bone marrow, modified by transfection with microRNA-9-5p
      (miR-9-5p), and infused into the spinal cord. Spontaneous flinches, paw
      withdrawal latency, limb-use score, and weight-bearing score were used to assess 
      pain-related behaviors. ELISA, RT-PCR, western blot, and luciferase assay were
      used to assess gene expressions. Results: Our results show that miR-9-5p
      regulated the expression of both repressor element silencing transcription factor
      (REST) and μ-opioid receptors (MOR) by targeting REST in primary mouse BMSCs.
      Overexpression of miR-9-5p reversed the activation of inflammatory pathway in
      TNF-α- and IL-6-treated BMSCs. In addition, miR-9-5p modified BMSCs alleviated
      cancer pain in the sarcoma-inoculated mouse model. MiR-9-5p modified BMSCs
      suppressed cytokine expression in the spinal cord of sarcoma-inoculated mice by
      suppressing REST gene expression. Conclusions: Our results indicate that miR-9-5p
      modified BMSCs can relieve bone cancer pain via modulating neuroinflammation in
      the central nervous system, suggesting genetically modified BMSCs could be a
      promising cell therapy in pain management.

      with ropivacaine alone and in combination with meloxicam in cats undergoing
      ovariohysterectomy.
LID - 88
AB  - Background: Infiltration of the surgical site with local anesthetics combined
      with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may play an important role in improving
      perioperative pain control. This prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled
      clinical trial aimed to evaluate intraoperative isoflurane requirements,
      postoperative analgesia, and adverse events of infiltration of the surgical site 
      with ropivacaine alone and combined with meloxicam in cats undergoing
      ovariohysterectomy. Forty-five cats premedicated with acepromazine/meperidine and
      anesthetized with propofol/isoflurane were randomly distributed into three
      treatments (n = 15 per group): physiological saline (group S), ropivacaine alone 
      (1 mg/kg, group R) or combined with meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg, group RM) infiltrated
      at the surgical site (incision line, ovarian pedicles and uterus). End-tidal
      isoflurane concentration (FE’ISO), recorded at specific time points during
      surgery, was adjusted to inhibit autonomic responses to surgical stimulation.
      Pain was assessed using an Interactive Visual Analog Scale (IVAS), UNESP-Botucatu
      Multidimensional Composite Pain Scale (MCPS), and mechanical nociceptive
      thresholds (MNT) up to 24 h post-extubation. Rescue analgesia was provided with
      intramuscular morphine (0.1 mg/kg) when MCPS was ≥6. Results: Area under the
      curve (AUC) of FE’ISO was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in the RM (17.8 ± 3.1)
      compared to S (23.1 ± 2.2) and R groups (22.8 ± 1.1). Hypertension (systolic
      arterial pressure > 160 mmHg) coinciding with surgical manipulation was observed 
      only in cats treated with S and R (4/15 cats, P = 0.08). The number of cats
      receiving rescue analgesia (4 cats in the S group and 1 cat in the R and RM
      groups) did not differ among groups (P = 0.17). The AUC of IVAS, MCPS and MNT did
      not differ among groups (P = 0.56, 0.64, and 0.18, respectively). Significantly
      lower IVAS pain scores were recorded at 1 h in the RM compared to the R and S
      groups (P = 0.021–0.018). There were no significant adverse effects during the
      study period. Conclusions: Local infiltration with RM decreased intraoperative
      isoflurane requirements and resulted in some evidence of improved analgesia
      during the early postoperative period. Neither R nor RM infiltration appeared to 
      result in long term analgesia in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy.

TI  - First line in psychiatric emergency: pre-hospital emergency protocol for mental
      disorders in Iran.
LID - 19
AB  - Introduction: This article is a report of designing a rapid and effective guide
      for paramedics who take care of patients in a pre-hospital setting to answer
      developing demands. Methods: The relevant literature was reviewed, and the topics
      were extracted. Then, the extracted items were discussed in an expert panel.
      Finally, items were discussed in a meeting including emergency technicians and
      emergency technical assistants to identify implementation problems. Results:
      Important topics for managing psychiatric patients were categorized at three
      levels: 1) Patient safety and security issues, 2) Patient status assessment and
      diagnosis, and 3) Patient management (medical, behavioral management, and
      referral to a treatment center). Discussion: This protocol can be a solution to
      improve emergency technician training. Such summarized protocols can be used for 
      rapid review immediately before exposing a patient with an acute psychiatric
      condition. Due to specific cultural and different access to medicines in Iran,
      some issues are different.

TI  - Study design considerations for sleep-disordered breathing devices.
PG  - 441-9
AB  - In recent years, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been recognized as a
      prevalent but under-diagnosed condition in adults and has prompted the need for
      new and better diagnostic and therapeutic options. To facilitate the development 
      and availability of innovative, safe and effective SDB medical device
      technologies for patients in the United States, the US Food and Drug
      Administration collaborated with six SDB-related professional societies and a
      consumer advocacy organization to convene a public workshop focused on clinical
      investigations of SDB devices. Sleep medicine experts discussed appropriate
      definitions of terms used in the diagnosis and treatment of SDB, the use of home 
      sleep testing versus polysomnography, clinical trial design issues in studying
      SDB devices, and current and future trends in digital health technologies for
      diagnosis and monitoring SDB. The panel’s breadth of clinical expertise and
      experience across medical specialties provided useful and important insights
      regarding clinical trial designs for SDB devices.Citation:: Mann EA, Nandkumar S,

TI  - Anti-allodynic effect induced by curcumin in neuropathic rat is mediated through 
      the NO-cyclic-GMP-ATP sensitive K+ channels pathway.
LID - 83
AB  - Background: Recent studies pointed up that curcumin produces an anti-nociceptive 
      effect in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. However, the possible mechanisms of 
      action that underline the anti-allodynic effect induced by curcumin are not yet
      established. The purpose of this study was to determine the possible
      anti-allodynic effect of curcumin in rats with L5-L6 spinal nerve ligation (SNL).
      Furthermore, we study the possible participation of the NO-cyclic
      GMP-ATP-sensitive K+ channels pathway in the anti-allodynic effect induced by
      curcumin. Methods: Tactile allodynia was measured using von Frey filaments by the
      up-down method in female Wistar rats subjected to SNL model of neuropathic pain. 
      Results: Intrathecal and oral administration of curcumin prevented, in a
      dose-dependent fashion, SNL-induced tactile allodynia. The anti-allodynic effect 
      induced by curcumin was prevented by the intrathecal administration of L-NAME
      (100 μg/rat, a non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), ODQ (10 μg/rat, an
      inhibitor of guanylate-cyclase), and glibenclamide (50 μg/rat, channel blocker of
      ATP-sensitive K+ channels). Conclusions: These data suggest that the
      anti-allodynic effect induced by curcumin is mediated, at least in part, by the
      NO-cyclic GMP-ATP-sensitive K+ channels pathway in the SNL model of neuropathic
      pain in rats.

TI  - Rapid referral for headache management from emergency department to headache
      centre: four years data.
LID - 25
AB  - Background: Headache is one of the most common reason for medical consultation to
      emergency department (ED). The inappropriate use of ED for non-emergency
      conditions is a problem in terms of overcrowding of emergency facilities,
      unnecessary testing and treatment, increased medical costs, burden on medical
      service providers and weaker relationships between patient and primary care
      provider. The aim of this study was to analyze the different stages of ED
      management of headache to identify those deficiencies that can be overcome by a
      fast referral to a headache clinic. Methods: The study is a retrospective
      analysis of the electronic medical records of patients discharged from an
      academic ED between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018 and referred to the
      tertiary level headache centre of the same hospital. We analyzed all aspects
      related to the permanence in ED and also assessed whether there was a match
      between the diagnosis made in ED and ours. Results: Among our sample of 244
      patients, 76.2% were admitted as “green tag”, 75% underwent a head computed
      tomography, 19.3% received a neurological consultation, 43% did not receive any
      pharmacological treatment and 62.7% still had headache at discharge. The length
      of stay in ED was associated with reporting the first aura ever (p = 0.014) and
      whether patients received consultations (p < 0.001). The concordance analysis
      shown a significant moderate agreement only for the diagnosis of migraine and
      only between triage and headache centre. Conclusions: Most patients who went to
      ED complaining of headache received the same treatment regardless of their
      diagnosis and in many cases the headache had not yet resolved at the time of
      discharge. Given the many shortcomings in headache management in ED, rapid
      referral to the headache centre is of paramount importance to help the patient
      achieve a definiteve diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

TI  - Medication assisted treatment (MAT) in criminal justice settings as a
      double-edged sword: balancing novel addiction treatments and voluntary
      participation.
LID - 7
AB  - Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) provides an opportunity to address opioid
      addiction among justice-involved individuals, an often difficult to reach
      population. This potential has been increasingly recognized by agencies,
      policymakers and pharmaceutical companies. The result has been a marked increase 
      in the number of drug courts, prisons and agencies in which MAT, notably with
      long-acting injectable medications, is offered. While this is a positive
      development, ensuring that vulnerable individuals are in a position voluntarily
      participation within the complex criminal justice environment is necessary. The
      unequal authority and agency inherent in the nature of these environments should 
      be recognized. Therefore, rigorous protections, mirroring the goals of the
      consent processes required for medical or sociobehavorial research, should be
      employed when MAT is offered to protect individual autonomy.

TI  - Assessment and prioritization of the WHO “best buys” and other recommended
      interventions for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases in
      Iran.
LID - 333
AB  - Background: The WHO’s “best buys” and other recommended interventions are a menu 
      of policy options and cost-effective interventions for the prevention and control
      of major noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The menu has six objectives,
      implementing which by member states is expected to promote the achievement of the
      nine NCD targets by 2025. In line with their context, countries can select from
      the menu of best buys and other recommended interventions. Iran adopted its
      national action plan on NCDs, 2015, including global as well as some specific
      goals and targets. This study had two objectives: analyzing the gaps to reach the
      national targets on NCDs; and prioritizing the best buys and other recommended
      interventions based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDA) method for the
      context of Iran. Methods: This is a mixed-methods study. We used qualitative
      textual evidence (documentary content analysis) and MCDA for prioritization of
      interventions based on five criteria, including a number of people to be
      potentially affected by the intervention, cost-effectiveness of the intervention,
      attributable burden (DALY per 100,000), hospitalization and variations among
      income levels. Data related to five criteria for each intervention were extracted
      from national studies and relevant international organizations. The weight of
      each criterion determines based on the opinions of national experts. Results: Out
      of 105 actions and interventions recommended by WHO, only 12 of them were not on 
      the national agenda in Iran, while the six missed interventions were related to
      objective number 4. Only one of the best buys Group’s interventions was not
      targeted (vaccination against human papillomavirus, two doses of 9–13-year-old
      girls), for which arrangements are being made for the implementation. Encouraging
      and educating healthy dietary habits and increasing public awareness about the
      side effects of smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke, e.g., through mass
      media campaigns, are among the interventions in need of serious prioritization.
      The priority of interventions was independently calculated in the area of risk
      factors and clinical preventive interventions. Conclusion: Due to limited
      resources, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) need to identify and
      prioritize more cost-effective and more equitable interventions to combat the NCD
      epidemic. Based on our findings, we advocate more investment in the mass and
      social media campaigns to promote a healthy diet, avoid tobacco use, as well as
      the inclusion of some effective clinical preventive interventions into the
      national action plan, along the long pathway to tackle NCDs and ultimately reach 
      sustainable health development in Iran. The use of the MCDA approach assisted us 
      in formulating a simultaneous use of efficiency and equity, and other indices for
      prioritizing the interventions.

      itch and pain related behaviors.
LID - 1397
AB  - Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) functions as a neurotransmitter for
      non-histaminergic itch, but its site of action (sensory neurons vs spinal cord)
      remains controversial. To determine the role of GRP in sensory neurons, we
      generated a floxed Grp mouse line. We found that conditional knockout of Grp in
      sensory neurons results in attenuated non-histaminergic itch, without impairing
      histamine-induced itch. Using a Grp-Cre knock-in mouse line, we show that the
      upper epidermis of the skin is exclusively innervated by GRP fibers, whose
      activation via optogeneics and chemogenetics in the skin evokes itch- but not
      pain-related scratching or wiping behaviors. In contrast, intersectional genetic 
      ablation of spinal Grp neurons does not affect itch nor pain transmission,
      demonstrating that spinal Grp neurons are dispensable for itch transmission.
      These data indicate that GRP is a neuropeptide in sensory neurons for
      non-histaminergic itch, and GRP sensory neurons are dedicated to itch
      transmission.

      adolescents.
LID - 30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate socio-demographic, family and behavioral factors associated
      with oral health literacy (OHL) in adolescents. METHODS: Cross-sectional study
      conducted with adolescents aged 15 to 19 years in Campina Grande, Brazil.
      Parents/guardians answered a questionnaire addressing socio-demographic data. The
      adolescents answered validated instruments on family cohesion and adaptability
      (family adaptability and cohesion evaluation scale), drug use (alcohol, smoking
      and substance involvement screening test), type of dental service used for last
      appointment and OHL (Brazilian version of the Rapid Estimate of Oral Health
      Literacy in Dentistry). Two dentists were trained to evaluate OHL (K =
      0.87–0.88). Descriptive analysis was performed, followed by Poisson regression
      analysis (α = 5%). A directed acyclic graph was used to select independent
      variables in the study. RESULTS: The following variables remained associated with
      better OHL: high mother’s schooling level (RR = 1.07; 95%CI: 1.03–1.12), high
      income (RR = 1.04; 95%CI: 1.01–1.09), white ethnicity/skin color (RR = 1.05;
      95%CI: 1.01–1.10), married parents (RR = 1.04; 95%CI: 1.01–1.09), “enmeshed”
      family cohesion (RR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.12–1.30), “structured” (RR = 1.06; 95%CI:
      1.01–1.12) or “rigid” (RR = 1.11; 95%CI: 1.04–1.19) family adaptability, having
      more than five residents in the home (RR = 1.07; 95%CI: 1.01–1.14) and having
      used a private dental service during the last appointment (RR = 1.08; 95%CI:
      1.03–1.13). CONCLUSION: Family functioning and socio-demographic factors
      influence the level of oral health literacy among adolescents.

TI  - Drug use and torsades de pointes cardiac arrhythmias in Sweden: a nationwide
      register-based cohort study.
LID - e034560
AB  - Objective: To study the occurrence of torsades de pointes (TdP) ventricular
      tachycardia in relation to use of drugs labelled with TdP risk, using two
      nationwide Swedish registers. Design: Prospective register-based cohort study.
      Setting: Entire Sweden. Participants: Persons aged ≥18 years prescribed and
      dispensed any drug classified with TdP risk during 2006–2017, according to
      CredibleMeds. Persons with a registered TdP diagnosis during the study period,
      using drugs labelled with known (TdP 1), possible (TdP 2) or conditional (TdP 3) 
      risk at the incident of TdP were examined. Primary outcome measures: Occurrence
      of TdP in relation to exposure rates for individual drugs with TdP risk.
      Secondary outcome measures: Concurrent use of more than one TdP-labelled drug in 
      a person with a TdP diagnosis. Results: During the study period, 410 TdP cases
      using drugs with TdP risk labels at the incident were registered; 205 women and
      205 men, mean age 74.0 and 71.5 years, respectively. Antidepressants dominated
      (129/410, 30%), followed by antiarrhythmics (17%). Diuretics and gastric
      acid-secretion inhibitors, with TdP risk related to induction of hypokalaemia or 
      hypomagnesaemia, were used in 56% and 32% of the 410 TdP cases, respectively.
      Among the most used antidepressants, citalopram with known TdP 1 risk was
      associated with both a higher absolute number and incidence of TdP per 100 000
      users (two to four times), compared with mirtazapine with possible (TdP 2), and
      sertraline with conditional (TdP 3) risk. Multiple risk factors, including
      advanced age, cardiovascular disease and treatment with more than one
      TdP-classified drug, were frequently observed. Conclusions: Antidepressants
      followed by antiarrhythmics dominated among TdP risk drugs used by adults with
      TdP diagnosis, the majority being ≥65 years. TdP risk class and concomitant
      medication should be considered when prescribing antidepressants to older
      patients.

TI  - Outcome reporting in neonates experiencing withdrawal following opioid exposure
      in pregnancy: a systematic review.
LID - 262
AB  - Background: Neonatal withdrawal secondary to in utero opioid exposure is a
      growing global concern stressing the psychosocial well-being of affected families
      and scarce hospital resources. In the ongoing search for the most effective
      treatment, randomized controlled trials are indispensable. Consistent outcome
      selection and measurement across randomized controlled trials enables synthesis
      of results, fostering the translation of research into practice. Currently, there
      is no core outcome set to standardize outcome selection, definition and
      reporting. This study identifies the outcomes currently reported in the
      literature for neonates experiencing withdrawal following opioid exposure during 
      pregnancy. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and
      Cochrane Central was conducted to identify all primary research studies
      (randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, case-controlled studies,
      uncontrolled trials, observational cohort studies, clinical practice guidelines
      and case reports) reporting outcomes for interventions used to manage neonatal
      abstinence syndrome between July 2007 and July 2017. All “primary” and
      “secondary” neonatal outcomes were extracted by two independent reviewers and
      were assigned to one of OMERACT’s core areas of “pathophysiological
      manifestation”, “life impact”, “resource use”, “adverse events”, or “death”.
      Results: Forty-seven primary research articles reporting 107 “primary” and 127
      “secondary” outcomes were included. The most frequently reported outcomes were
      “duration of pharmacotherapy” (68% of studies, N = 32), “duration of hospital
      stay” (66% of studies, N = 31) and “withdrawal symptoms” (51% of studies,
      N = 24). The discrepancy between the number of times an outcome was reported and 
      the number of articles was secondary to the use of composite outcomes. Frequently
      reported outcomes had heterogeneous definitions or were not defined by the study 
      and were measured at different times. Outcomes reported in the literature to date
      were mainly assigned to the core areas “pathophysiologic manifestations” or
      “resource use”. No articles reported included parent or former patient
      involvement in outcome selections. Conclusions: Inconsistent selection and
      definition of primary and secondary outcomes exists in the present literature of 
      pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for managing opioid withdrawal
      in neonates. No studies involved parents in the process of outcome selection.
      These findings hinder evidence synthesis to generate clinically meaningful
      practice guidelines. The development of a specific core outcome set is
      imperative.

TI  - Remifentanil patient-controlled versus epidural analgesia on intrapartum maternal
      fever: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 151
AB  - Background: Intravenous remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia (RPCA) is an
      alternative for epidural analgesia (EA) in labor pain relief. However, it remains
      unknown whether RPCA is superior to EA in decreasing the risk of intrapartum
      maternal fever during labor. Methods: According to the Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review
      and meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to April 2019. All
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the risk of intrapartum
      maternal fever with RPCA compared with EA alone or EA in combination with spinal 
      analgesia during labor were included. Results: A total of 825 studies were
      screened, and 6 RCTs including 3341 patients were identified. Compared with EA,
      RPCA was associated with a significantly lower incidence of intrapartum maternal 
      fever (risk ratio [RR] 0.48, P = 0.02, I2 = 49%) during labor analgesia. After
      excluding 2 trials via the heterogeneity analysis, there was no difference in the
      incidence of intrapartum fever between patients receiving RPCA and those
      receiving EA. Satisfaction with pain relief during labor was lower in the RPCA
      group than that in the EA group (− 10.6 [13.87, − 7.44], P < 0.00001, I2 = 0%).
      The incidence of respiratory depression was significantly greater in the RPCA
      group than that in the EA group (risk ratio 2.86 [1.65, 4.96], P = 0.0002,
      I2 = 58%). The incidence of Apgar scores < 7 at 5 min in the RPCA group was
      equivalent to that in the EA group. Conclusion: There is no solid evidence to
      illustrate that the incidence of intrapartum maternal fever is lower in patients 
      receiving intravenous RPCA than in patients receiving EA.

TI  - Dispensation of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications in
      patients receiving opioid agonist therapy; a national prospective cohort study in
      Norway from 2015 to 2017.
LID - 119
AB  - Background: It is estimated that up to a third of patients on opioid agonist
      therapy (OAT) have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatment by 
      ADHD medication, including a centrally acting stimulant (CAS) or atomoxetine is
      one of the essential approaches. This study evaluates the use of dispensed ADHD
      medications in the Norwegian OAT population in the period from 2015 to 2017.
      Types and doses of ADHD medications, co-dispensations of other potentially
      addictive drugs like benzodiazepines, z-hypnotics, gabapentinoids, and non-OAT
      opioids, as well as direct-acting antivirals (DAA) against hepatitis C infection,
      are investigated. Methods: Information about all dispensed ADHD medication, OAT
      opioids, and the defined potentially addictive drugs were recorded from the
      Norwegian Prescription Database. Dispensation rates, the types, and the doses of 
      dispensed ADHD medications were estimated by summarizing the number of
      dispensations, and the dispensed doses. Logistic regression analyses were
      employed to assess the associations between ADHD medication, and OAT opioid use, 
      and dispensations of other potentially addictive drugs and DAAs against hepatitis
      C infection. Results: A total of 9235 OAT patients were included. The proportion 
      of patients who were dispensed ADHD medication increased from 3.5 to 4.6%
      throughout the study period. The three most dispensed CAS were short- and
      intermediate-acting methylphenidate (55%), lisdexamphetamine (24%), and
      dexamphetamine (17%) in 2017. Buprenorphine, rather than methadone, as OAT opioid
      (adjusted odds ratio: 1.6, CI: 1.2–2.1) was associated with being dispensed ADHD 
      medication. Among patients who received CAS and OAT opioids each calendar year,
      the dispensed doses of methylphenidate increased from 63 mg/day in 2015 to
      76 mg/day in 2017 (p = 0.01). Sixty percent of patients receiving ADHD
      medications were also dispensed other addictive drugs concomitantly in 2017.
      Similar results were found in 2015 and 2016. Conclusion: Co-prescription of ADHD 
      medications was low among patients on OAT in Norway, considering a high
      prevalence of ADHD in this patient group. On the other hand, concurrent
      dispensations of multiple addictive drugs were common in this population.
      Understanding the underlying reasons for such prescribing is essential, and
      research on how to optimize ADHD medication of patients with ADHD receiving OAT
      is needed.

TI  - The challenge of safe anesthesia in developing countries: defining the problems
      in a medical center in Cambodia.
LID - 204
AB  - Background: The International Standards for a Safe Practice of Anesthesia (ISSPA)
      were developed on behalf of the World Federation of Societies of
      Anaesthesiologists and the World Health Organization. It has been recommend as an
      assessment tool that allows anesthetic providers in developing countries to
      assess their compliance and needs. This study was performed to describe the
      anesthesia service in one main public hospital during an 8-month medical mission 
      in Cambodia and evaluate its anesthetic safety issues according to the ISSPA.
      Methods: We conduct a retrospective study involving 1953 patients at the Preah
      Ket Mealea hospital. Patient demographics, anesthetic techniques, and
      complications were reviewed according to the registers of the anesthetic services
      and questionnaires. The inadequacies in personnel, facilities, equipment,
      medications, and conduct of anesthesia drugs were recorded using a checklist
      based on the ISSPA. Results: A total of 1792 patients received general and
      regional anesthesia in the operating room, while 161 patients receiving sedation 
      for gastroscopy. The patients’ mean age was 45.0 ± 16.6 years (range,
      17–87 years). The three most common surgical procedures were abdominal (52.0%;
      confidence interval [CI], 49.3–54.7), orthopedic (27.6%; CI, 25.2–29.9), and
      urological surgery (14.7%; CI, 12.8–16.6). General anesthesia, spinal anesthesia,
      and brachial plexus block were performed in 54.3% (CI, 51.7–56.8), 28.2% (CI,
      25.9–30.5), and 9.4% (CI, 7.9–10.9) of patients, respectively. One death
      occurred. Twenty-six items related to professional aspects, monitoring, and
      conduct of anesthesia did not meet the ISSPA-recommended standards. A lack of
      commonly used drugs and monitoring equipment was noted, posing major threats to
      the safety of anesthesia practice, especially in emergency situations.
      Conclusions: This study adds to the scarce literature on anesthesia practice in
      low- and middle-income countries such as Cambodia. Future medical assistance
      should help to strengthen these countries’ inadequacies, allowing for the
      adoption of international standards for the safe practice of anesthesia.

TI  - Safety and effectiveness of peficitinib (ASP015K) in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis: interim data (22.7 months mean peficitinib treatment) from a
      long-term, open-label extension study in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan.
LID - 47
AB  - Background: Peficitinib (ASP015K), a novel oral Janus kinase inhibitor, has
      demonstrated efficacy and safety for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
      in randomized, controlled trials of up to 52 weeks’ duration. However, safety and
      effectiveness after long-term treatment have not been assessed. Methods: This was
      an interim analysis of an ongoing open-label, multicenter extension study in RA
      patients who completed phase 2b (RAJ1; 12 weeks) and phase 3 (RAJ3 and RAJ4;
      52 weeks) peficitinib studies in Asia (mainly Japan). Eligible patients (n = 843)
      received oral peficitinib once daily (100 mg, or 50 mg for patients transferring 
      from RAJ1). The peficitinib dose could be increased (up to 150 mg) or reduced (to
      50 mg) at the discretion of the investigator. Efficacy variables assessed
      included American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates, ACR components,
      and disease activity score in 28 joints based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP). 
      Results: Results up to May 2018 are summarized. Mean peficitinib duration of
      exposure was 22.7 months and the maximum dose was 100 mg in most (66.5%)
      patients. ACR responses were maintained during the extension study, with
      ACR20/50/70 response rates of 71.6%, 52.1%, and 34.7% at week 0 and 78.9%, 61.4%,
      and 42.7% at end of treatment, respectively. ACR components and DAS28-CRP showed 
      improvements from baselines of the preceding studies and continued to show
      improvements during the extension study. Treatment-emergent adverse events
      (TEAEs) were reported in 757/843 (89.8%) patients, the most common being
      nasopharyngitis (39.7%) and herpes zoster (11.7%). The majority of TEAEs were
      severity grade 1/2. Drug-related TEAEs leading to permanent study drug
      discontinuation occurred in 55/843 (6.5%) patients. Regarding AEs of special
      interest, the incidence per 100 patient-years of serious infections was 2.3 (95% 
      CI 1.6 – 3.1), herpes zoster-related disease 6.8 (95% CI, 5.6 – 8.3), and
      malignancies 1.1 (95% CI, 0.7 – 1.8). One death from diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma during the study and one death from uterine sarcoma after the study were
      considered probably and possibly related to study drug, respectively.
      Conclusions: The effectiveness of peficitinib was maintained or improved during
      long-term administration and treatment up to 6 years was well tolerated in Asian 
      patients with RA. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01638013, registered
      retrospectively 11 July 2012.

TI  - GluA1 in central amygdala increases pain but inhibits opioid withdrawal-induced
      aversion.
LID - 1744806920911543
AB  - The amygdala is important in regulation of emotion-associated behavioral
      responses both to positive reinforcing stimuli such as addicting opioids and to
      negative aversive stimuli such as fear and pain. Glutamatergic neurotransmission 
      in amygdala plays a predominant role in amygdala neuronal circuits involved in
      these emotional responses. However, how specific glutamate receptors act to
      mediate these amygdala functions remains poorly understood. In this study, we
      investigated the role of GluA1 subunits of glutamate
      α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in central 
      amygdala in modulating behavioral response to aversive stimuli by pain and by
      opioid withdrawal. We found that the protein level of GluA1 in the central
      nucleus of amygdala (CeA) was significantly increased in rats under persistent
      pain and viral upregulation of CeA GluA1 increased pain responses of both
      hyperalgesia and allodynia in rats. In contrast, the viral upregulation of CeA
      GluA1 inhibited, while knockdown of CeA GluA1 enhanced, place aversion induced by
      naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. These results reveal a differential
      action of CeA GluA1 on the aversive event of sensory pain and opioid withdrawal, 
      likely reflecting two distinct synaptic circuits of GluA1-predominant AMPA
      receptors within CeA for regulation of pain sensitivity and emotional response to
      opioid withdrawal.

TI  - Association of Alcohol Screening Scores With Adverse Mental Health Conditions and
      Substance Use Among US Adults.
LID - e200895
AB  - Question: Can alcohol use screening scores provide clinically meaningful
      information and facilitate identification of adverse mental health conditions and
      other substance use? Findings: This cohort study using data from 6431 US patients
      collected from 2003 to 2012 found that high alcohol use scores (Alcohol Use
      Disorders Identification Test score ≥20) were associated with depression,
      anxiety, crack or cocaine use, and other stimulant use, with likelihood ratios
      greater than 3.5. Meaning: These findings suggest that alcohol screening can
      inform decisions about further screening and diagnostic assessment for
      depression, anxiety, and some drug use outcomes.

TI  - Highly-selective µ-opioid receptor antagonism does not block L-DOPA-induced
      dyskinesia in a rodent model.
LID - 149
AB  - Objectives: Dopamine-replacement utilizing L-DOPA is still the mainstay treatment
      for Parkinson’s disease (PD), but often leads to development of L-DOPA-induced
      dyskinesia (LID), which can be as debilitating as the motor deficits. There is
      currently no satisfactory pharmacological adjunct therapy. The endogenous opioid 
      peptides enkephalin and dynorphin are important co-transmitters in the direct and
      indirect striatofugal pathways and have been implicated in genesis and expression
      of LID. Opioid receptor antagonists and agonists with different selectivity
      profiles have been investigated for anti-dyskinetic potential in preclinical
      models. In this study we investigated effects of the highly-selective μ-opioid
      receptor antagonist CTAP (> 1200-fold selectivity for μ- over δ-opioid receptors)
      and a novel glycopeptide congener (gCTAP5) that was glycosylated to increase
      stability, in the standard rat LID model. Results: Intraperitoneal administration
      (i.p.) of either 0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg CTAP and gCTAP5 completely blocked
      morphine’s antinociceptive effect (10 mg/kg; i.p.) in the warm water tail-flick
      test, showing in vivo activity in rats after systemic injection. Neither
      treatment with CTAP (10 mg/kg; i.p.), nor gCTAP5 (5 mg/kg; i.p.) had any effect
      on L-DOPA-induced limb, axial, orolingual, or locomotor abnormal involuntary
      movements. The data indicate that highly-selective μ-opioid receptor antagonism
      alone might not be sufficient to be anti-dyskinetic.

TI  - Implementation of opioid maintenance treatment in prisons in North
      Rhine-Westphalia, Germany – a top down approach.
LID - 21
AB  - Background: Opioid Maintenance Treatment (OMT) is a well-evaluated treatment of
      opioid use disorder (OUD). Especially, under the condition of imprisonment, OMT
      is a preventive measure regarding infectious diseases such as hepatitis C.
      However, only a minority of prisoners with OUD are currently in OMT in numerous
      countries. In 2009, the Ministry of Justice of the federal state of North
      Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany, launched the process of implementing OMT in
      prisons with various elements (e.g. development of recommendations regarding the 
      treatment of prisoners with OUD, monitoring the number of prisoners in OMT,
      education of prison doctors). In the recommendations OMT was defined as the gold 
      standard of treatment of OUD. Methods: To assess the effectiveness of the
      implementation strategy a survey on the prevalence of OMT in prisons in NRW was
      carried out twice a year by the Ministry of Justice between 2008 and 2016.
      Participants were prisoners in NRW, Germany. The diagnosis of OUD at admission to
      prison and the treatment state on survey dates was measured. Results: The number 
      of prisoners in NRW dropped from 17,301 in 2008 to 16,432 in 2016. In the same
      period, the number of prisoners with OUD (mainly males) dropped from 4201 persons
      to 3650 persons and the number of prisoners in OMT increased from 139 persons
      (3.3%) to 1415 (38.7%) persons. Discussion: Currently, the percentage of
      prisoners with OUD in OMT in NRW is almost reaching the treatment rate outside
      prisons in Germany (45–50%). However, after release from prison there is still a 
      high risk for a discontinuation of OMT. Conclusions: Overall, the top-down
      approach of implementing OMT in prisons in the federal state of NRW was
      effective.

TI  - Metformin effect on gut microbiota: insights for HIV-related inflammation.
LID - 10
AB  - The gut microbiota is emerging as a prominent player in maintaining health
      through several metabolic and immune pathways. Dysregulation of gut microbiota
      composition, also known as dysbiosis, is involved in the clinical outcome of
      diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer, aging and HIV infection. Gut
      dysbiosis and inflammation persist in people living with HIV (PLWH) despite
      receiving antiretroviral therapy, further contributing to non-AIDS comorbidities.
      Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic agent, has been found to benefit microbiota
      composition, promote gut barrier integrity and reduce inflammation in human and
      animal models of diabetes. Inspired by the effect of metformin on
      diabetes-related gut dysbiosis, we herein critically review the relevance of
      metformin to control inflammation in PLWH. Metformin may improve gut microbiota
      composition, in turn reducing inflammation and risk of non-AIDS comorbidities.
      This review will pave the way towards innovative strategies to counteract
      dysregulated microbiota and improve the lives of PLWH.

TI  - Addressing overdose risk among unstably housed women in San Francisco,
      California: an examination of potential fentanyl contamination of multiple
      substances.
LID - 17
AB  - Background: Numerous reports have led to concerns that fentanyl is added to many 
      street drugs as an adulterant, including to stimulants like cocaine and
      methamphetamine, and could increase risks for negative health outcomes. Methods: 
      We collected information regarding recent substance use through self-report and
      urine toxicology (confirmed with mass spectrometry) once a month for up to 6
      monthly study visits from a probability sample of 245 women in San Francisco with
      a history of housing instability (2016-2019). We compared the presence of
      fentanyl metabolites with (1) the presence of metabolites for other substances
      and (2) self-reported past week substance use. Results: Out of 1050 study visits,
      fentanyl metabolites were detected 35 times (i.e., at 3% of all study visits and 
      among 19/245, or 8% of all women). In most but not all (91%, or 32/35) of these
      detected cases, heroin or opioid medication use was self-reported. Among women
      who reported cocaine or methamphetamine use, but did not use heroin or opioid
      medication, fentanyl was detected in only 1 of 349 cases (0.3%). In adjusted
      logistic regression, the presence of fentanyl metabolites was independently
      associated with (1) presence of opiate, heroin, and benzodiazepine metabolites,
      and (2) self-reported past week use of heroin and opioid medications. Fentanyl
      metabolite detection was not independently associated with cocaine or
      methamphetamine use. Conclusions: The presence of fentanyl metabolites in this
      population was almost entirely among women who also reported using heroin or
      opioid pills. These data do not support the hypothesis that fentanyl is being
      routinely added to stimulants as an adulterant on a large scale in this region.

TI  - Epidemiological and geospatial profile of the prescription opioid crisis in Ohio,
      United States.
LID - 4341
AB  - The underlying reasons behind the unprecedented increase of the mortality rates
      due to the opioid epidemics in the United States are still not fully uncovered.
      Most efforts have been focused on targeting opioids, but there is little
      information about vulnerable populations at high risk of opioid abuse and death. 
      In this study, we used data from the Ohio Department of Health for deaths caused 
      by prescription opioids from 2010–2017 to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of 
      the opioid overdose epidemic. Our results showed a rapid increase in prescription
      opioid death rates among the white male population aged 30–39 but also a
      considerable increase among the black male population with an exponential growth 
      trend. Our geospatial analysis suggests that the increasing rates of the opioid
      overdose epidemic in Ohio were driven by the epidemic hotspot areas. Our findings
      highlight the relevance of prioritizing public health measures targeting specific
      locations and vulnerable populations to mitigate the current opioids crisis.

TI  - Autonomic nervous system and inflammation interaction in endometriosis-associated
      pain.
LID - 80
AB  - Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. Pain is the most common symptom 
      in endometriosis. Endometriosis-associated pain is caused by inflammation, and is
      related to aberrant innervation. Although the specific mechanism between
      endometriosis-associated pain and the interaction of aberrant innervation and
      inflammation remains unclear, many studies have confirmed certain correlations
      between them. In addition, we found that some chronic inflammatory autoimmune
      diseases (AIDs) such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) share similar characteristics: the changes in dysregulation of inflammatory 
      factors as well as the function and innervation of the autonomic nervous system
      (ANS). The mechanisms underlying the interaction between the ANS and inflammation
      have provided new advances among these disorders. Therefore, the purpose of this 
      review is to compare the changes in inflammation and ANS in endometriosis, IBD,
      and RA; and to explore the role and possible mechanism of sympathetic and
      parasympathetic nerves in endometriosis-associated inflammation by referring to
      IBD and RA studies to provide some reference for further endometriosis research
      and treatment.

TI  - The Operant Plantar Thermal Assay: A Novel Device for Assessing Thermal Pain
      Tolerance in Mice.
LID - ENEURO.0210-19.2020
AB  - Pain is a multidimensional experience of sensory-discriminative, cognitive, and
      affective processes; however, current basic research methods rely heavily on
      response to threshold stimuli, bypassing the supraspinal processing that
      ultimately gives rise to the pain experience. We developed the operant plantar
      thermal assay (OPTA), which utilizes a novel, conflict-based operant task
      requiring evaluation and active decision-making to obtain reward under thermally 
      aversive conditions to quantify thermal pain tolerance. In baseline measures,
      male and female mice exhibited similar temperature preferences, however in the
      OPTA, female mice exhibited greater temperature-dependent tolerance, as defined
      by choice time spent in an adverse thermal condition to obtain reward. Increasing
      reward salience (4% vs 10% sucrose solution) led to increased thermal tolerance
      for males but not females. To determine whether neuropathic and inflammatory pain
      models alter thermal tolerance, animals with chronic constriction injury (CCI) or
      complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), respectively, were tested in the OPTA.
      Surprisingly, neuropathic animals exhibited increased thermal tolerance, as shown
      by greater time spent in the reward zone in an adverse thermal condition,
      compared with sham animals. There was no effect of inflammation on thermal
      tolerance. Administration of clonidine in the CCI model led to increased thermal 
      tolerance in both injured and sham animals. In contrast, the non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory meloxicam was anti-hyperalgesic in the CFA model, but reduced
      thermal pain tolerance. These data support the feasibility of using the OPTA to
      assess thermal pain tolerance to gain new insights into complex pain behaviors
      and to investigate novel aspects of analgesic efficacy.

TI  - 10-kHz High-Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation for Adults With Chronic Noncancer
      Pain: A Health Technology Assessment.
PG  - 1-109
AB  - Background: Chronic pain is costly for patients and for the health care system.
      It negatively affects people's physical, emotional, social, and mental health. We
      conducted a health technology assessment of 10-kHz high-frequency spinal cord
      stimulation (SCS) in adults with chronic noncancer pain that was refractory to
      medical management, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety,
      cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency
      SCS, and patient preferences and values. Methods: We performed a systematic
      literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each 
      included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias and ROBINS-I tools and the quality
      of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
      Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a
      systematic economic literature search. We analyzed the 5-year budget impact of
      publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in Ontario for adults with chronic
      noncancer pain who had already tried other available SCS therapies (up to 1.2
      kHz). To contextualize the potential value of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS, we spoke
      with people who had chronic noncancer pain. Results: We included 5 studies (7
      publications) in the clinical evidence review. Overall, 10-kHz high-frequency SCS
      likely provides reductions in pain intensity and functional disability, and
      improvements in quality of life in people with chronic noncancer pain (GRADE:
      Moderate). As well, patients may reduce their opioid consumption with 10-kHz
      high-frequency SCS (GRADE: Low). The two included economic evaluations found that
      10-kHz high-frequency SCS was cost-saving compared with conventional SCS, but
      neither was applicable to the Ontario context. Owing to limited evidence about
      the effectiveness of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in people who have first tried and
      failed SCS at lower frequencies (up to 1.2 kHz), we did not conduct a
      cost-effectiveness analysis comparing this pathway of care and 10-kHz
      high-frequency SCS for Ontario. Publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS (using
      the Freedom SCS system) in Ontario over the next 5 years would lead to a total
      net cost savings of $0.73 million (ranging from about $0.10 million in year 1 to 
      about $0.21 million in year 5). However, if the province outsourced this therapy 
      using the Senza HF10 SCS system, the total 5-year budget impact would be about
      $8.76 million. The people we spoke with who had chronic noncancer pain reported
      that their pain had a substantial negative impact on their activities and
      emotional well-being. Their direct knowledge of different pain therapies allowed 
      them to provide context and comparisons when they discussed the impact of SCS on 
      their chronic pain. Conclusions: For adults with chronic noncancer pain that was 
      refractory to medical management, 10-kHz high-frequency SCS was effective in
      relieving pain, reducing disability, and improving quality of life. Because there
      was limited evidence about the effectiveness of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in
      people who had first tried and failed SCS at lower frequencies (up to 1.2 kHz),
      we were unable to determine whether 10-kHz high-frequency SCS is cost-effective
      in the Ontario context. We estimate that publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency
      SCS in Ontario would result in cost savings of about $0.10 million to $0.21
      million per year, for a potential total 5-year net cost savings of about $0.73
      million. Although people with chronic noncancer pain knew little about SCS before
      they received it, they reported that it reduced their level of chronic pain,
      leading to improvements in function and their ability to perform activities of
      daily living.

      placebo-controlled trial.
LID - 1756286420911296
AB  - Background:: PF-06649751 is a novel, oral, non-catechol-based, D1/D5 dopamine
      receptor partial agonist under investigation for the treatment of motor symptoms 
      associated with Parkinson’s disease. Methods:: A 15-week, phase II, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety
      of flexible-dose PF-06649751 in subjects with early stage Parkinson’s disease
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02847650). Results:: Enrollment was terminated
      early for reasons unrelated to the trial. Overall, 57 subjects received study
      medication (PF-06649751 = 29; placebo = 28) and 47 completed the study
      (PF-06649751 = 25; placebo = 22). Despite early termination, the study met its
      primary endpoint with the PF-06649751 group showing statistically significant
      improvement from baseline in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s
      Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III score at week 15 compared with placebo.
      Mean (SE) change in MDS-UPDRS Part III score was −9.0 (1.54) for PF-06649751 and 
      −4.3 (1.65) for placebo. This corresponds to an improvement versus placebo of 4.8
      for the PF-06649751 group (two-sided p = 0.0407; 90% CI = 1.0, 8.6).
      Statistically significant improvement in MDS-UPDRS-III score was also observed at
      all assessment time points prior to week 15. The safety profile of PF-06649751
      was similar to that observed in prior studies, with the majority of adverse
      events (AEs) reported as mild or moderate. The most common AEs in the PF-06649751
      group were nausea, headache, dry mouth, somnolence, and tremor. Conclusions::
      Once-daily dosing of oral PF-06649751 resulted in significant improvement of
      motor symptoms and was generally well tolerated in subjects with early stage
      Parkinson’s disease.

TI  - Inhaled Methoxyflurane versus Intravenous Morphine for Severe Trauma Pain in the 
      Emergency Setting: Subgroup Analysis of MEDITA, a Multicenter, Randomized,
      Controlled, Open-Label Trial.
PG  - 491-502
AB  - Purpose: Opioid analgesics remain the cornerstone of treatment for severe trauma 
      pain in the emergency setting, but there are barriers to their use. This post hoc
      analysis of a previously reported trial (MEDITA) investigated the efficacy and
      safety of low-dose methoxyflurane versus intravenous (IV) morphine for severe
      trauma pain. Patients and Methods: MEDITA was a Phase IIIb, randomized,
      active-controlled, parallel-group, open-label study in Italian pre-hospital units
      and emergency departments (EudraCT: 2017-001565-25; NCT03585374). Adult patients 
      (N=272) with moderate-to-severe trauma pain (score ≥4 on the Numerical Rating
      Scale [NRS]) were randomized 1:1 to inhaled methoxyflurane (3 mL) or standard
      analgesic treatment (SAT; IV paracetamol 1g or ketoprofen 100mg for moderate pain
      [NRS 4–6] and IV morphine 0.1mg/kg for severe pain [NRS ≥7]). Analyses were
      performed for the severe pain subgroup. The primary efficacy variable was the
      overall change from baseline in visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity at 3, 5 
      and 10min post-randomization. Non-inferiority of methoxyflurane versus morphine
      was concluded if the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment
      difference was <1; superiority was concluded if the upper 95% CI was <0. Results:
      Ninety-three patients (methoxyflurane: 49; SAT: 44) were included in the severe
      pain intention-to-treat population. The reduction in VAS pain intensity over the 
      first 10min was superior for methoxyflurane versus morphine (adjusted mean
      treatment difference: −5.54mm; 95% CI: −10.49, −0.59mm; p=0.029). Median time to 
      onset of pain relief was 9min for methoxyflurane and 15min for morphine. Patients
      rated treatment efficacy and physicians rated treatment practicality “Excellent” 
      or “Very good” for more methoxyflurane-treated patients (42.8% and 67.3%) than
      morphine-treated patients (18.1% and 22.8%). Adverse events, all non-serious,
      were reported in 20.4% of methoxyflurane-treated patients and in 4.8% of
      morphine-treated patients. Conclusion: Methoxyflurane provided superior
      short-term pain relief to IV morphine in patients with severe trauma pain and
      offers an effective non-narcotic treatment option.

      factors.
LID - e03471
AB  - Interventions are urgently needed to reduce prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors, including anxiety and concomitant use of sedatives. However, only a
      limited number of randomized controlled opioid intervention trials have been
      conducted. We sought to determine whether an online behavior change/support
      community, compared to a control Facebook group, could reduce anxiety and opioid 
      misuse among chronic pain patients. 51 high-risk non-cancer chronic pain patients
      were randomly assigned to either a Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE)
      peer-led online behavior change intervention or a control group (no peer leaders)
      on Facebook for 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria were: 18 years or older, a UCLA
      Health System patient, prescribed an opioid for non-cancer chronic pain between 3
      and 12 months ago, and a score of ≥9 on the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) 
      and/or concomitant use of benzodiazepines. Participation in the online community 
      was voluntary. Patients completed baseline and follow-up assessments on
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder screener (GAD-7), COMM, and frequency of social
      media discussions about pain and opioid use. Compared to control group
      participants, intervention participants showed a baseline-to-follow-up decrease
      in anxiety, and more frequently used social media to discuss pain, prescription
      opioid use, coping strategies, places to seek help, and alternative therapies for
      pain. Both groups showed a baseline to follow-up decrease in COMM score.
      Preliminary results support the use an online community interventions as a
      low-cost tool to decrease risk for prescription opioid misuse and its
      complications.

      anti-nociceptive C-glycosylated flavones.
LID - 110
AB  - C-glycosylated flavones (CGFs) are promising candidates as anti-nociceptive
      compounds. The leaves of bamboo and related crops in the grass family are a
      largely unexploited bioresource with a wide array of CGFs. We report here
      pathway-specific enzymes including C-glycosyltransferases (CGTs) and P450
      hydroxylases from cereal crops and bamboo species accumulating abundant CGFs.
      Mining of CGTs and engineering of P450s that decorate the flavonoid skeleton
      allowed the production of desired CGFs (with yield of 20–40 mg/L) in an
      Escherichia coli cell factory. We further explored the antinociceptive activity
      of major CGFs in mice models and identified isoorientin as the most potent, with 
      both neuroanalgesic and anti-inflammatory effects superior to clinical drugs such
      as rotundine and aspirin. Our discovery of the pain-alleviating flavonoids
      elicited from bamboo and crop leaves establishes this previously underutilized
      source, and sheds light on the pathway and pharmacological mechanisms of the
      compounds.

TI  - Efficacy of local infiltration analgesia with ropivacaine for postoperative pain 
      management in cervical laminoplasty: a retrospective study.
LID - 4217
AB  - Poor postoperative pain control impairs patient recovery and lengthens the
      duration of hospitalization after various surgeries. Local infiltration
      analgesia(LIA) has become an effective method for managing postoperative pain.
      This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of LIA with ropivacaine for
      postoperative pain control after cervical laminoplasty. In total, 68 patients
      undergoing cervical laminoplasty were included for retrospective review and
      divided into ropivacaine and control groups. The visual analogue scale (VAS)
      score, postoperative analgesic consumption, operative duration, intraoperative
      blood loss volume, incision length, hospitalization duration and incidence of
      complications were analyzed. In the ropivacaine group, the VAS score was
      3.2 ± 1.4 at 4 hours postoperatively, which was lower than that of the control
      group(4.0 ± 1.4, P = 0.024). At 8, 12 and 24 hours after surgery, a significant
      difference was detected in the VAS score between the two groups(P ≤ 0.015).
      Sufentanil consumption was less in the ropivacaine group than in the control
      group in the first 4 hours postoperatively (25.6 ± 6.3 µg vs 32.2 ± 6.8 µg,
      P < 0.001), and similar results were observed in the first 8, 12, 24, 48 and
      72 hours postoperatively(P < 0.001). Fewer patients required rescue analgesia in 
      the ropivacaine group(8/33 vs 18/35 at 4–8 hours, P = 0.021; 9/33 vs 21/35 at
      8–12 hours, P = 0.007). The hospitalization duration and time to ambulation were 
      shorter in the ropivacaine group(8.5 ± 1.4 vs 9.6 ± 1.6 for postoperative
      duration, P = 0.002; 2.9 ± 0.7 vs 3.5 ± 0.8 for time to ambulation, P = 0.001).
      The incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower in the ropivacaine group than in
      the control group(30.3% vs 54.3%, P = 0.046). In conclusion, LIA with ropivacaine
      could effectively reduce postoperative pain, and postoperative analgesic
      consumption, and promote recovery after cervical laminoplasty.

TI  - Continuous wound infiltration versus epidural analgesia for midline abdominal
      incisions – a randomized-controlled pilot trial (Painless-Pilot trial; DRKS
      Number: DRKS00008023).
LID - e0229898
AB  - Objectives: To test the feasibility of a randomized controlled study design
      comparing epidural analgesia (EDA) with continuous wound infiltration (CWI) in
      respect to postoperative complications and mobility to design a future
      multicentre randomized controlled trial. Design, setting, participants: CWI has
      been developed to address drawbacks of EDA. Previous studies have established the
      equivalent analgesic potential of CWI compared to EDA. This is a single centre,
      non-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial at a tertiary surgical centre.
      Patients undergoing elective non-colorectal surgery via a midline laparotomy were
      randomized to EDA or CWI. Endpoints included recruitment, feasibility of
      assessing postoperative mobility with a pedometer and morbidity. No primary
      endpoint was defined and all analyses were explorative. Interventions: CWI with
      local anaesthetics (experimental group) vs. thoracic EDA (control). Results: Of
      846 patients screened within 14 months, 71 were randomized and 62 (31 per group) 
      included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Mobility was assessed in 44 of 62
      patients and revealed no differences within the first 3 postoperative days.
      Overall morbidity did not differ between the two groups (measured via the
      comprehensive complication index). Median pain scores at rest were comparable
      between the two groups, while EDA was superior in pain treatment during movement 
      on the first, but not on the second and third postoperative day. Duration of
      preoperative induction of anaesthesia was shorter with CWI than with EDA. Of 17
      serious adverse events, 3 were potentially related to EDA, while none was related
      to CWI. Conclusion: This trial confirmed the feasibility of a randomized trial
      design to compare CWI and EDA regarding morbidity. Improvements in the education 
      and training of team members are necessary to improve recruitment. Trial
      registration: DRKS00008023.

TI  - The analgesic effects of buprenorphine (Vetergesic or Simbadol) in cats
      undergoing dental extractions: A randomized, blinded, clinical trial.
LID - e0230079
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of two dosage regimens using 
      two different concentrations of buprenorphine in cats undergoing dental
      extractions. Twenty-three cats with oral disease (8.2 ± 2.2 years old; 4.9 ± 0.9 
      kg) were included in a prospective, blinded, randomized clinical trial. Cats
      randomly received either Simbadol (1.8 mg/mL; 0.24 mg/kg, subcutaneously, every
      24h: SG, n = 11) or Vetergesic (0.3 mg/mL; 0.02 mg/kg, intramuscularly, every 8h:
      VG, n = 12) throughout the study. They were admitted at day 0, underwent oral
      examination/radiographs/treatment under general anesthesia
      (buprenorphine-propofol-isoflurane-meloxicam-local anesthetic blocks) at day 1
      and discharged at day 4. Sedation and pain were scored using the dynamic
      interactive visual analog scale (day 1) and the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain
      Scale-Feline (CMPS-F; up to postoperative 8 hours at day 1, 8 am, 4 pm and
      midnight at days 2 and 3, and 8 am at day 4), respectively. Rescue analgesia was 
      administered with hydromorphone (0.05 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 or 0.1 mg/kg
      intramuscularly after day 2) when CMPS-F ≥ 5. Resentment defined as any type of
      escape behavior associated with aversion to drug administration was recorded.
      Sedation and pain scores, the prevalence of rescue analgesia and resentment
      during drug administration were analyzed using linear mixed models and Fisher’s
      exact test, respectively (p < 0.05). Pain and sedation scores were not
      significantly different between groups. Sedation scores were significantly higher
      up to postoperative 2 hours in both groups. Pain scores in SG and VG were
      significantly higher up to postoperative 8 hours and 8 am of day 2, respectively,
      than baseline. Prevalence of rescue analgesia and resentment were not
      significantly different between groups (SG: 27.3%, VG: 33.3% and SG: 0%, VG: 25%,
      respectively). Simbadol produced similar analgesic effects to Vetergesic without 
      resentment during drug administration.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of DAAs in HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coinfected
      patients with psychiatric disorders.
LID - 196
AB  - Background: Few data are available regarding the use of direct antiviral agents
      (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C in psychiatric patients. The aim of the study is
      to assess safety and outcome of DAAs in patients with psychiatric comorbidities. 
      Methods: This retrospective, observational, single-centre study enrolled patients
      treated with psychiatric drugs who initiated DAAs between 2015 and 2018. Patients
      were classified into two groups: A (on anxiolitycs/antidepressant) and B (on
      antipsychotics). Week-12 sustained virological response (SVR-12) and adverse
      events (AEs) were evaluated. Results: One hundred forty-four patients were
      included (A:101; B:43). Patients were 49.3% males, mean age 60 years (SD ± 13.5);
      31.9% cirrhotic; 125 (86.8%) HCV-monoinfected and 19 (13.2%) HCV /HIV-coinfected.
      Twenty patients (13.8%) required a change of psychiatric therapy before
      initiation of DAA. Overall, SVR-12 was achieved in 88.2% of subjects in
      intention-to-treat(ITT)-analysis. Lower SVR rates were observed in group B vs A
      (79% vs 92%, p = 0.045) and in those changing psychiatric drugs vs others (8% vs 
      30%, p = 0.015). According to per-protocol (PP)-analysis, SVR-12 was achieved in 
      93/95 (97.9%) in group A versus 34/36 (94.4%) in group B (p = 0.30). At least one
      AE occurred in 60 patients (41.6%), including 10 severe AEs, leading to 3
      discontinuations. AEs were more frequently reported in group A (p = 0.015).
      Conclusions: The study confirms effectiveness and safety of DAA-based treatment
      also in this special population, even if a careful evaluation of history and
      drug-drug interactions is warranted.

TI  - The protocol for a multisite, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
      of axillary nerve stimulation for chronic shoulder pain.
LID - 248
AB  - Background: Shoulder impingement syndrome is one of the most common causes of
      shoulder pain, accounting for approximately 30% of all shoulder pain.
      Approximately 35% of patients with shoulder impingement syndrome are refractory
      to conservative treatment. For patients who fail conservative treatment, there is
      no established treatment to successfully treat their chronic pain. Prior
      randomized control trials have demonstrated efficacy for the use of a single lead
      intramuscular peripheral nerve stimulation of the axillary nerve at the motor
      points of the deltoid muscle for treatment of hemiplegic shoulder pain. This is
      the first controlled trial to utilize the same novel technology to treat shoulder
      impingement syndrome outside of the stroke population. Methods: This is a
      dual-site, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized control trial.
      Participants will be randomized to two treatment groups. The intervention group
      will be treated with active peripheral nerve stimulation of the axillary nerve of
      the affected shoulder and the control group will be treated with sham peripheral 
      nerve stimulation of the axillary nerve of the affected shoulder. Both groups
      will receive a standardized exercise therapy program directed by a licensed
      therapist. Discussion: This study protocol will allow the investigators to
      determine if this novel, non-pharmacologic treatment of shoulder pain can
      demonstrate the same benefit in musculoskeletal patients which has been
      previously demonstrated in the stroke population. Trial registration:

TI  - Patient experience of the informed consent process during acute myocardial
      infarction: a sub-study of the VALIDATE-SWEDEHEART trial.
LID - 246
AB  - Objective: We aimed to assess the patient experience of informed consent (IC)
      during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a sub-study of the
      VALIDATE-SWEDEHEART trial. The original trial compared two anticoagulant agents
      in patients undergoing coronary intervention. A witnessed oral IC was required
      prior to randomization in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction, which was subsequently complemented with a written IC after
      percutaneous coronary intervention. Written consent was obtained before
      angiography in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.
      Background: The IC process in patients with AMI is under debate. Earlier trials
      in this population have required prospective consent before randomization. A
      trial published some years ago used deferred consent, but the patient experience 
      of this process is poorly studied. Methods: A total of 414 patients who
      participated in the main trial were enrolled and asked the following questions:
      (1) Do you remember being asked to participate in a study? (2) How was your
      experience of being asked to participate; do you remember it being positive or
      negative? (3) Would you have liked more information about the study? (4) Do you
      think it would have been better if you were included in the study without being
      informed until a later time? Results: Of these patients, 94% remembered being
      included; 85% of them experienced this positively, 12% were neutral and 3%
      negative. Regarding more information, 88% did not want further information, and
      68% expressed that they wanted to be consulted before inclusion. Of the patients,
      5% thought it would have been better to have study inclusion without consent, and
      27% considered it of no importance. Conclusion: It is reasonable to ask patients 
      for verbal IC in the acute phase of AMI. Most patients felt positively about
      being asked to participate and had knowledge of being enrolled in a scientific
      study. In addition they objected to providing IC after randomization and
      treatment. Trial registration: VALIDATE-SWEDEHEART European Union Clinical Trials

TI  - Effects of ultrasound-guided paravertebral block on MMP-9 and postoperative pain 
      in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
LID - 59
AB  - Background: Local anesthesia can reduce the response to surgical stress and
      decrease the consumption of opioids, which may reduce immunosuppression and
      potentially delay postoperative tumor recurrence. We compared paravertebral block
      (PVB) combined with general anesthesia (GA) and general anesthesia regarding
      their effects on postoperative pain and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) after 
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Methods: 54 patients
      undergoing elective VATS lobectomy at a single tertiary care, teaching hospital
      located in Qingdao between May 2, 2018 and Sep 28, 2018 were randomised by
      computer to either paravertebral block combined with general anesthesia or
      general anesthesia. The primary outcomes were pain scores at rest and on cough at
      1, 4, 24, and 48 h after surgery. The secondary outcome were plasma
      concentrations of MMP-9, complications, and length of postoperative hospital
      stay. Results: 75 were enrolled to the study, of whom 21 were excluded before
      surgery. We analyzed lobectomy patients undergoing paravertebral block combined
      with general anesthesia (n = 25) or general anesthesia (n = 24). Both groups were
      similar regarding baseline characteristics. Pain scores at rest at 4 h and 24 h, 
      on cough at 4 h were lower in PVB/GA group, compared with GA group (P < 0.05).
      There were no difference in pain scores at rest at 1 h, 48 h and on cough at 1 h,
      24 h, and 48 h between groups. Patients in the PVB/GA group showed a greater
      decrease in plasma MMP-9 level at T1 and T2 after VATS lobectomy (P < 0.05).
      Postoperative complications and length of stay did not differ by anesthetic
      technique. Conclusions: The paravertebral block/general anesthesia can provide
      statistically better pain relief and attenuate MMP-9 response to surgery and
      after VATS lobectomy. This technique may be beneficial for patients to recover
      rapidly after lung surgery and reduce postoperative tumor recurrence. Trial

TI  - Factors Associated with Life Satisfaction in Older Adults with Chronic Pain
      (PainS65+).
PG  - 475-89
AB  - Background: Chronic pain in later life is a worldwide problem. In younger
      patients, chronic pain affects life satisfaction negatively; however, it is
      unknown whether this outcome will extend into old age. Objective: This study
      examines which factors determine life satisfaction in older adults who suffer
      from chronic pain with respect to socio-demographics, lifestyle behaviors, pain, 
      and comorbidities. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited a random sample 
      of people ≥65 years old living in south-eastern Sweden (N= 6611). A postal survey
      addressed pain aspects and health experiences. Three domains from the Life
      Satisfaction Questionnaire (LiSat-11) were used to capture the individual’s
      estimations of overall satisfaction (LiSat-life), somatic health
      (LiSat-somhealth), and psychological health (LiSat-psychhealth). Results:
      Respondents with chronic pain (2790, 76.2±7.4 years old) rated lower on life
      satisfaction than those without chronic pain, with medium effect size (ES) on
      LiSat-somhealth (r = 0.38, P < 0.001) and small ES on the other two domains (r < 
      0.3). Among the respondents with chronic pain, severe pain (OR 0.29–0.59) and
      pain spreading (OR 0.87–0.95) were inversely associated with all three domains of
      the LiSat-11. Current smoking, alcohol overconsumption, and obesity negatively
      affected one or more domains of the LiSat-11. Most comorbidities were negatively 
      related to LiSat-somhealth, and some comorbidities affected the other two
      domains. For example, having tumour or cancer negatively affected both LiSat-life
      (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44–0.88) and LiSat-somhealth (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24–0.74).
      Anxiety or depression disorders had a negative relationship both for LiSat-life
      (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38–0.78) and LiSat-psychhealth (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06–0.14).
      Conclusion: Older adults with chronic pain reported lower life satisfaction but
      the difference from their peers without chronic pain was trivial, except for
      satisfaction with somatic health. Pain management in old age needs to consider
      comorbidities and severe pain to improve patients’ life satisfaction.

TI  - Daily physical activity and related risk factors in COPD.
LID - 60
AB  - Background: Factors associated with reduced daily physical activity (DPA) in
      patients with COPD are still controversial. Physical inactivity in COPD increases
      risk of cardiovascular disease, frequent exacerbations, reduced health status,
      and increased symptoms. We hypothesised that reduced DPA in patients with COPD is
      independent of traditional risk factors including age and spirometry. Methods: In
      this cross-sectional study, DPA (over 7 days) was assessed on 88 community stable
      patients with COPD and 40 controls free from cardiorespiratory disease.
      Spirometry, body composition, number of exacerbations, handgrip strength (HGS),
      modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), arterial stiffness, 6-min walking
      distance (6MWD) and BODE index were also determined. Frequent exacerbation was
      defined as ≥2 and non-frequent exacerbation < 2. Results: Patients with COPD had 
      reduced DPA and exercise capacity compared with controls similar in age, BMI and 
      gender, p < 0.001. Frequent exacerbators had less DPA than infrequent
      exacerbators and both less than controls, p < 0.001. Patients with higher BODE
      index were less active than those with lower index. Time spent on moderate
      activity was related to cardiovascular risk factors including arterial stiffness.
      The DPA in patients was independent of age, gender, spirometry, body composition 
      and HGS, p > 0.05. The level of breathlessness was superior to lung function in
      predicting the level of DPA. Conclusion: The level of DPA in COPD was independent
      of traditional risk factors. Breathlessness score is a better predictor of the
      DPA than lung function and handgrip strength.

      Illness, Addictions, and Chronic Pain.
LID - 2150132720910289
AB  - Objective: To determine how accessible health care services are for people who
      are experiencing homelessness and to understand from their perspectives what
      impact clinician bias has on the treatment they receive. Methods: Narrative
      interviews were conducted with 53 homeless/vulnerably housed individuals in
      Ontario, Canada. Visit history records were subsequently reviewed at 2 local
      hospitals, for 52 of the interview participants. Results: Of the 53 participants 
      only 28% had a primary care provider in town, an additional 40% had a provider in
      another town, and 32% had no access to a primary care provider at all. A subset
      of the individuals were frequent emergency department users, with 15% accounting 
      for 75% of the identified hospital visits, primarily seeking treatment for mental
      illness, pain, and addictions. When seeking primary care for these 3 issues
      participants felt medication was overprescribed. Conversely, in emergency care
      settings participants felt prejudged by clinicians as being drug-seekers.
      Participants believed they received poor quality care or were denied care for
      mental illness, chronic pain, and addictions when clinicians were aware of their 
      housing status. Conclusion: Mental illness, chronic pain, and addictions issues
      were believed by participants to be poorly treated due to clinician bias at the
      primary, emergency, and acute care levels. Increased access to primary care in
      the community could better serve this marginalized population and decrease
      emergency department visits but must be implemented in a way that respects the
      rights and dignity of this patient population.

TI  - Safety of oral naltrexone in HIV-positive men who have sex with men and
      transgender women with alcohol use disorder and initiating antiretroviral
      therapy.
LID - e0228433
AB  - HIV disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender
      women (TW). These populations use alcohol more heavily than the general
      population, and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are more prevalent among them.
      Naltrexone (NTX) has documented efficacy and safety as a medication-assisted
      therapy for AUD. Its use has not been well-examined in persons with HIV (PWH)
      newly initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) where the possibility of
      hepatotoxicity may be increased when initating multiple new medications. This
      study assessed the safety of oral NTX treatment (50 mg daily) initiated
      concomitantly with antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a double-blind randomized
      placebo-controlled trial of NTX in MSM/TW in Lima, Peru among MSM and TW with AUD
      (AUDIT score ≥ 8). We analyzed adverse event data from ART-naïve participants (N 
      = 155) who were randomized (2:1) to initiate ART plus NTX (N = 103) or ART plus
      placebo (N = 52). Participants were monitored for 24 weeks while taking ART plus 
      NTX/placebo, followed by 24 weeks receiving ART alone. Over 48 weeks, 135 grade 2
      or 3 adverse events were reported, resulting in 1.3 clinical adverse events per
      participant equally represented in both treatment and placebo arms. Two serious
      adverse events occurred among two participants receiving NTX; neither was
      attributed to the study medication. No significant differences were found in the 
      proportion of subjects reporting any adverse events between treatment arms across
      all time-points. These results suggest NTX is safe in MSM/TW PWH with AUD newly
      initiating ART, as no excess of clinical adverse events or transaminase elevation
      was associated with NTX use.

TI  - Illicit drug use while admitted to hospital: Patient and health care provider
      perspectives.
LID - e0229713
AB  - Background: Across North America, the opioid overdose epidemic is leading to
      increasing hospitalizations of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, hospitals
      are ill-prepared to meet the needs of PWUD. We focus on illicit drug use while
      admitted to hospital and how PWUD and health care providers describe, respond,
      and attempt to manage its use. Methods and findings: Using varied purposive
      methods in Toronto and Ottawa, we recruited n = 24 PWUD (who self-reported that
      they were living with HIV and/or HCV infection; currently or had previously used 
      drugs or alcohol in ways that were harmful; had a hospital admission in the past 
      five years) and n = 26 health care providers (who were: currently working in an
      academic hospital as a physician, nurse, social worker or other allied health
      professional; and 2) providing care to this patient group). All n = 50
      participants completed a short, socio-demographic questionnaire and an
      audio-recorded semi-structured interview about receiving or providing acute care 
      in a hospital between 04/2014 and 05/2015. Patient participants received $25 CAD 
      and return transit fare; provider participants received a $50 CAD gift card for a
      bookseller. All participants provided informed consent. Audio-recordings were
      transcribed verbatim, corrected, and uploaded to NVivo 10. Using the seven-step
      framework method, transcripts were coded line-by-line and managed using NVvivo.
      An analytic framework was created by grouping and mapping the codes. Preliminary 
      analyses were presented to advisory group members for comment and used to refine 
      the interpretation. Questionnaire data were managed using SPSS version 22.0 and
      descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants. Many but not all
      patient participants spoke about using psycho-active substances not prescribed to
      them during a hospital admission. Attempts to avoid negative experiences (e.g.,
      withdrawal, boredom, sadness, loneliness and/or untreated pain) were cited as
      reasons for illicit drug use. Most tried to conceal their illicit drug use from
      health care providers. Patients described how their self-reported level of pain
      was not always believed, tolerance to opioids was ignored, and requests for
      higher doses of pain medications denied. Some health care providers were unaware 
      of on-site illicit drug use; others acknowledged it occurred. Few could identify 
      a hospital policy specific to illicit drug use and most used their personal
      beliefs to guide their responses to it (e.g., ignore it, increase surveillance of
      patients, reprimands, loss of privileges/medications, threats of immediate
      discharge should it continue, and substitution dosing of medication).
      Conclusions: Providers highlighted gaps in institutional guidance for how they
      ought to appropriately respond to in-hospital substance use. Patients attempted
      to conceal illicit drug use in environments with no institutional policies about 
      such use, leading to varied responses that were inconsistent with the principles 
      of patient centred care and reflected personal beliefs about illicit drug use.
      There are increasing calls for implementation of harm reduction approaches and
      interventions in hospitals but uptake has been slow. Our study contributes to
      this emerging body of literature and highlights areas for future research, the
      development of interventions, and changes to policy and practice.

TI  - Immune-mediated febrile response in female rats: Role of central hypothalamic
      mediators.
LID - 4073
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces fever through cytokines like receptor-activator 
      of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), triggering mediators like prostaglandins
      (PG), endothelin-1 (ET-1), corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), substance P
      (SP) and endogenous opioids. LPS-induced fever is reduced in females compared
      with males except in ovariectomized (OVX) females which show increased fever
      mediated by PG. The present study aimed to identify the mediators involved in
      fever in intact and OVX female rats. Fever was induced with LPS (50 μg/kg)
      intraperitoneally or CRF (2.5 μg), ET-1 (1 pg), morphine (10 μg) and SP (500 ng) 
      intracerebroventricularly in sham-operated and OVX rats. The role of RANKL was
      evaluated with osteoprotegerin (OPG, 1 μg, intracerebroventricularly). Expression
      of RANK, CRFI/II, ETB, μ-opioid (MOR) and NK1 receptors was evaluated by confocal
      microscopy. Besides LPS, only morphine induced fever in OVX rats while all
      mediators induced fever in sham-operated animals. OPG abolished LPS-induced fever
      in OVX but not sham-operated animals. Overall, fever involves similar central
      mediators in cycling females and males but only morphine induced fever in OVX
      females. Importantly, RANK/RANKL participates in LPS-induced fever in OVX
      females, as in males but not in cycling females.

TI  - Prevalence and Correlates of Caffeine Use Disorder Symptoms Among a United States
      Sample.
PG  - 4-11
AB  - Background: The DSM-5 recognizes caffeine use disorder as a condition for further
      study, but there is a need to better understand its prevalence and clinical
      significance among the general population.Methods: A survey was conducted among
      an online sample of 1006 caffeine-consuming adults using demographic quotas to
      reflect the U.S. population. Caffeine consumption, DSM-proposed criteria for
      caffeine use disorder, sleep, substance use, and psychological distress were
      assessed.Results: Eight percent of the sample fulfilled DSM-proposed criteria for
      caffeine use disorder. These individuals consumed more caffeine, were younger,
      and were more likely to be cigarette smokers. Fulfilling caffeine use disorder
      criteria was associated with caffeine-related functional impairment, poorer
      sleep, some substance use, as well as greater depression, anxiety, and
      stress.Conclusions: The prevalence of caffeine use disorder among the present
      sample suggests that the proposed diagnostic criteria would identify only a
      modest percentage of the general population, and that identified individuals
      experience significant caffeine-related distress.

TI  - Opioid Receptors in Immune and Glial Cells—Implications for Pain Control.
LID - 300
AB  - Opioid receptors comprise μ (MOP), δ (DOP), κ (KOP), and nociceptin/orphanin FQ
      (NOP) receptors. Opioids are agonists of MOP, DOP, and KOP receptors, whereas
      nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) is an agonist of NOP receptors. Activation of all 
      four opioid receptors in neurons can induce analgesia in animal models, but the
      most clinically relevant are MOP receptor agonists (e.g., morphine, fentanyl).
      Opioids can also affect the function of immune cells, and their actions in
      relation to immunosuppression and infections have been widely discussed. Here, we
      analyze the expression and the role of opioid receptors in peripheral immune
      cells and glia in the modulation of pain. All four opioid receptors have been
      identified at the mRNA and protein levels in immune cells (lymphocytes,
      granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages) in humans, rhesus monkeys, rats or mice.
      Activation of leukocyte MOP, DOP, and KOP receptors was recently reported to
      attenuate pain after nerve injury in mice. This involved intracellular
      Ca2+-regulated release of opioid peptides from immune cells, which subsequently
      activated MOP, DOP, and KOP receptors on peripheral neurons. There is no evidence
      of pain modulation by leukocyte NOP receptors. More good quality studies are
      needed to verify the presence of DOP, KOP, and NOP receptors in native glia.
      Although still questioned, MOP receptors might be expressed in brain or spinal
      cord microglia and astrocytes in humans, mice, and rats. Morphine acting at
      spinal cord microglia is often reported to induce hyperalgesia in rodents.
      However, most studies used animals without pathological pain and/or
      unconventional paradigms (e.g., high or ultra-low doses, pain assessment after
      abrupt discontinuation of chronic morphine treatment). Therefore, the
      opioid-induced hyperalgesia can be viewed in the context of dependence/withdrawal
      rather than pain management, in line with clinical reports. There is convincing
      evidence of analgesic effects mediated by immune cell-derived opioid peptides in 
      animal models and in humans. Together, MOP, DOP, and KOP receptors, and opioid
      peptides in immune cells can ameliorate pathological pain. The relevance of NOP
      receptors and N/OFQ in leukocytes, and of all opioid receptors, opioid peptides
      and N/OFQ in native glia for pain control is yet to be clarified.

TI  - Zerumbone Modulates α2A-Adrenergic, TRPV1, and NMDA NR2B Receptors Plasticity in 
      CCI-Induced Neuropathic Pain In Vivo and LPS-Induced SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma In
      Vitro Models.
LID - 92
AB  - Zerumbone has shown great potential in various pathophysiological models of
      diseases, particularly in neuropathic pain conditions. Further understanding the 
      mechanisms of action is important to develop zerumbone as a potential
      anti-nociceptive agent. Numerous receptors and pathways function to inhibit and
      modulate transmission of pain signals. Previously, we demonstrated involvement of
      the serotonergic system in zerumbone’s anti-neuropathic effects. The present
      study was conducted to determine zerumbone’s modulatory potential involving
      noradrenergic, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in chronic constriction injury
      (CCI)-induced in vitro and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced SH-SY5Y in vitro
      neuroinflammatory models. von Frey filament and Hargreaves plantar tests were
      used to assess allodynia and hyperalgesia in the chronic constriction
      injury-induced neuropathic pain mouse model. Involvement of specific
      adrenoceptors were investigated using antagonists— prazosin (α1-adrenoceptor
      antagonist), idazoxan (α2-adrenoceptor antagonist), metoprolol (β1-adrenoceptor
      antagonist), ICI 118,551 (β2-adrenoceptor antagonist), and SR 59230 A
      (β3-adrenoceptor antagonist), co-administered with zerumbone (10 mg/kg).
      Involvement of excitatory receptors; TRPV and NMDA were conducted using
      antagonists capsazepine (TRPV1 antagonist) and memantine (NMDA antagonist).
      Western blot was conducted to investigate the effect of zerumbone on the
      expression of α2A-adrenoceptor, TRPV1 and NMDA NR2B receptors in CCI-induced
      whole brain samples of mice as well as in LPS-induced SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
      cells. Pre-treatment with α1- and α2-adrenoceptor antagonists significantly
      attenuated both anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects of zerumbone. For
      β-adrenoceptors, only β2-adrenoceptor antagonist significantly reversed the
      anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects of zerumbone. β1-adrenoceptor
      antagonist only reversed the anti-allodynic effect of zerumbone. The
      anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects of zerumbone were both absent when
      TRPV1 and NMDA receptors were antagonized in both nociceptive assays. Zerumbone
      treatment markedly decreased the expression of α2A-adrenoceptor, while an
      up-regulation was observed of NMDA NR2B receptors. Expression of TRPV1 receptors 
      however did not significantly change. The in vitro study, representing a
      peripheral model, demonstrated the reduction of both NMDA NR2B and TRPV1
      receptors while significantly increasing α2A-adrenoceptor expression in contrast 
      to the brain samples. Our current findings suggest that the α1-, α2-, β1- and
      β2-adrenoceptors, TRPV1 and NMDA NR2B are essential for the anti-allodynic and
      antihyperalgesic effects of zerumbone. Alternatively, we demonstrated the
      plasticity of these receptors through their response to zerumbone’s
      administration.

TI  - Efficacy of a Single Intra-Articular HYMOVIS ONE Injection for Managing
      Symptomatic Hip Osteoarthritis: A 12-Month Follow-Up Retrospective Analysis of
      the ANTIAGE Register Data.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - Purpose: The use of ultrasound (US) guidance has allowed hip osteoarthritis to be
      treated with intra-articular (IA) injections. HYMOVIS ONE (HYADD4-G) is a new
      hyaluronic acid (HA) derivative product with unusual characteristics, and it has 
      been used with good results in knee osteoarthritis (OA). This study assessed the 
      efficacy and safety of a single HYMOVIS ONE injection in patients affected by
      symptomatic hip OA. Patients and Methods: This post-marketing cohort study
      assessed data from the ANTIAGE Register. Inclusion criteria were age ≥40 years,
      symptomatic hip OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade I–III) of ≥1-year duration, and ≥12
      months follow-up. All patients received a single HYMOVIS ONE (32 mg/4 mL)
      injection at baseline. Values for 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, 
      the Lequesne index, and nonsteroidal anti–inflammatory drug (NSAID) consumption
      were evaluated at 6 and 12 months. Adverse events were also recorded. Results:
      The included patients (n = 198) consisted of 42.5% women, with a mean (± SD) age 
      at baseline of 62 (± 14.2) years and a mean (± SD) body mass index of 26.3 (±
      2.5). The mean (SD) Lequesne index and VAS pain scores at baseline were 11.5 (±
      4.6) and 6.4 cm (± 2.2), respectively. All groups exhibited statistically
      significant reductions at all time points compared to baseline. At 12 months, the
      VAS pain score was reduced by 17.2%, the Lequesne index by 33.7%, and NSAID
      consumption by 41.7%. Conclusion: Our study supports the clinical efficacy and
      safety of a single HYMOVIS ONE injection for managing symptoms in patients with
      hip OA, confirming previous data on the use of HYMOVIS as a background therapy in
      the management of knee osteoarthritis.

TI  - The Role of Inhaled Anesthetics in Tumorigenesis and Tumor Immunity.
PG  - 1601-9
AB  - Inhaled anesthetics are widely used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia
      during surgery, including isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, haloflurane,
      nitrous oxide (N2O), enflurane and xenon. Nowadays, it is controversial whether
      inhaled anesthetics may influence the tumor progression, which urges us to
      describe the roles of different inhaled anesthetics in human cancers. In the
      review, the relationships among the diverse inhaled anesthetics and patient
      outcomes, immune response and cancer cell biology were discussed. Moreover, the
      mechanisms of various inhaled anesthetics in the promotion or inhibition of
      carcinogenesis were also reviewed. In summary, we concluded that several inhaled 
      anesthetics have different immune functions, clinical outcomes and cancer cell
      biology, which could contribute to opening new avenues for selecting suitable
      inhaled anesthetics in cancer surgery.

TI  - Disentangling sensorimotor and cognitive cardioafferent effects: A
      cardiac-cycle-time study on spatial stimulus-response compatibility.
LID - 4059
AB  - Cardiac-cycle-time effects are attributed to variations in baroreceptor (BR)
      activity and have been shown to impinge on subcortical as well as cortical
      processes. However, cognitive and sensorimotor processes mediating voluntary
      responses seem to be differentially affected. We sought to disentangle
      cardiac-cycle-time effects on subcortical and cortical levels as well as
      sensorimotor and cognitive processes within a spatial
      stimulus-response-compatibility paradigm employing startling stimuli of different
      modalities. Air-puffs and white noise-bursts were presented unilaterally during
      either cardiac systole or diastole while bilateral startle EMG responses were
      recorded. Modality, laterality and cardiac-cycle-time were randomly varied
      within-subjects. Cognitive and sensorimotor stimulus-response-compatibility was
      orthogonally varied between-subjects: Participants (N = 80) responded to the
      stimuli via left/right button-push made with either the contra- or ipsilateral
      hand (sensorimotor compatibility) on either the ipsi- or contralateral button
      (cognitive compatibility). We found that sensorimotor compatible reactions were
      speeded during systole whereas sensorimotor incompatible ones were prolonged.
      This effect was independent of cognitive compatibility and restricted to auditory
      stimuli. Startle was inhibited during systole irrespective of modality or
      compatibility. Our results demonstrate how differential cardiac-cycle-time
      effects influence performance in conflict tasks and further suggest that
      stimulus-response-compatibility paradigms offer a viable method to uncover the
      complex interactions underlying behavioral BR effects.

TI  - Gene clustering and copy number variation in alkaloid metabolic pathways of opium
      poppy.
LID - 1190
AB  - Genes in plant secondary metabolic pathways enable biosynthesis of a range of
      medically and industrially important compounds, and are often clustered on
      chromosomes. Here, we study genomic clustering in the benzylisoquinoline alkaloid
      (BIA) pathway in opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), exploring relationships
      between gene expression, copy number variation, and metabolite production. We use
      Hi-C to improve the existing draft genome assembly, yielding chromosome-scale
      scaffolds that include 35 previously unanchored BIA genes. We find that
      co-expression of BIA genes increases within clusters and identify candidates with
      unknown function based on clustering and covariation in expression and alkaloid
      production. Copy number variation in critical BIA genes correlates with stark
      differences in alkaloid production, linking noscapine production with an 11-gene 
      deletion, and increased thebaine/decreased morphine production with deletion of a
      T6ODM cluster. Our results show that the opium poppy genome is still dynamically 
      evolving in ways that contribute to medically and industrially important
      phenotypes.

TI  - Prediction of stress and drug craving ninety minutes in the future with passively
      collected GPS data.
LID - 26
AB  - Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), typically smartphone apps, learn to
      deliver therapeutic content when users need it. The challenge is to “push”
      content at algorithmically chosen moments without making users trigger it with
      effortful input. We trained a randomForest algorithm to predict heroin craving,
      cocaine craving, or stress (reported via smartphone app 3x/day) 90 min into the
      future, using 16 weeks of field data from 189 outpatients being treated for
      opioid-use disorder. We used only one form of continuous input (along with
      person-level demographic data), collected passively: an indicator of
      environmental exposures along the past 5 h of movement, as assessed by GPS. Our
      models achieved excellent overall accuracy—as high as 0.93 by the end of 16 weeks
      of tailoring—but this was driven mostly by correct predictions of absence. For
      predictions of presence, “believability” (positive predictive value, PPV) usually
      peaked in the high 0.70s toward the end of the 16 weeks. When the prediction
      target was more rare, PPV was lower. Our findings complement those of other
      investigators who use machine learning with more broadly based “digital
      phenotyping” inputs to predict or detect mental and behavioral events. When
      target events are comparatively subtle, like stress or drug craving, accurate
      detection or prediction probably needs effortful input from users, not passive
      monitoring alone. We discuss ways in which accuracy is difficult to achieve or
      even assess, and warn that high overall accuracy (including high specificity) can
      mask the abundance of false alarms that low PPV reveals.

TI  - The Association of Diabetes with Knee Pain Severity and Distribution in People
      with Knee Osteoarthritis using Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative.
LID - 3985
AB  - Limited research has examined the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and 
      knee pain in people with osteoarthritis (OA). Therefore, this study aimed at
      examining the association between DM and knee pain severity, and to explore the
      association between DM and knee pain distribution (unilateral or bilateral versus
      no pain) in subjects with knee OA. This is a cross-sectional analysis of the
      baseline visit of individuals who were enrolled in the Osteoarthritis Initiative.
      Data of participants with knee OA were used for this analysis (n = 1319), and
      grouped into subjects with both knee OA and DM (n = 148) or knee OA only without 
      DM (n = 1171). Pain severity was measured using a numeric rating scale from 0 to 
      10 over the past 7 and 30 days for each knee, and the more symptomatic knee with 
      higher pain severity was chosen for analysis. DM was significantly associated
      with increased knee pain severity over 7 days (B 0.68; 95% CI 0.25–1.11) and over
      30 days (B 0.59; 95% CI 0.17–1.01) after adjustments for all covariates,
      including age, gender, BMI, race, depression symptoms, composite OA score, use of
      pain medications, and knee injections. Multinomial regression showed that
      participants with knee OA and DM had 2.45 (95% CI 1.07–5.61) to 2.55 (95% CI
      1.12–5.79) times higher likelihood of having unilateral and bilateral knee pain
      than those without DM and without knee pain. This study found that DM was
      associated with higher pain severity and unilateral and bilateral knee pain
      distribution.

TI  - Perioperative Continuous Femoral Nerve Block Reduces Postoperative Cognitive
      Dysfunction of High-Risk Patients with Femoral Neck Fracture: Evidence from a
      Retrospective Propensity-Matched Study.
PG  - e919708-1-e919708-10
AB  - Background: Elderly patients often suffer from postoperative cognitive impairment
      which increases mortality, morbidity, and the economic burden. However, how
      continuous femoral nerve block (cFNB) influence the incidence of postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction (POCD) has never been reported. This study tried to explore
      how cFNB affects the incidence of POCD among low-risk and high-risk patients with
      femoral neck fractures. Material/Methods: We conducted a retrospective propensity
      score-matched study and allocated matched patients (n=172) with femoral neck
      fractures into the cFNB group (n=86) and the control group (n=86). Demographical 
      and clinical data were collected and compared, including the visual analog scale 
      (VAS) score, the morphine consumption, and the POCD incidence. Subgroup analysis 
      of high-risk patients (Mini-Cog score ≤2) and low-risk patients (Mini-Cog score
      ≥3) was also carried out. Results: After matching, baseline characteristics of 2 
      groups were comparable between the 2 groups (all P>0.05). Compared with the
      control group, the cFNB group had significantly lower visual analog scale (VAS)
      score and morphine consumption in the postoperative 3 days (P<0.05). For
      high-risk patients, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve suggested that the incidence 
      of POCD the cFNB group was significantly lower than the control group (P=0.005), 
      without statistical difference for total or low-risk patients (P>0.05).
      Multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis showed that the adoption of cFNB
      conferred a protective effect on POCD (HR=0.556, 95% CI 0.316–0.981, P=0.043).
      Conclusions: For patients undergoing femoral neck fracture surgery, perioperative
      cFNB administration is useful in decreasing the incidence of POCD, especially for
      high-risk patients with a Mini-Cog score equal to or less than 2 points.

TI  - Using four different clinical tools as predictors for pain after total hip
      arthroplasty: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 57
AB  - Background: Treatment of postoperative pain remains a significant clinical
      problem, and prediction of patients with a risk of higher postoperative pain
      levels is an important focus. We aimed to identify patients undergoing total hip 
      arthroplasty (THA) with risk of higher pain levels at 24 h postoperatively by
      using four simple and easily available clinical tools. Methods: This prospective 
      observational cohort study included 102 patients having THA at Zealand University
      Hospital in Denmark. The following predictive tools were investigated for
      identifying patients with higher postoperative pain levels at 24 h
      postoperatively, both at rest and during mobilization: preoperative pain by
      peripheral venous cannulation (PVC) (dichotomized according to numerical rating
      scale pain ≤ 2/> 2 (PVC-Low/PVC-High) (primary outcome); the post anesthesia care
      unit (PACU) nurses’ expectations of patients pain levels; patients early pain
      levels at the PACU; and patients own forecast of postoperative pain levels. The
      Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze comparisons between prediction groups.
      For the primary outcome we considered a p-value < 0.01 as statistically
      significant and for other outcomes a p-value of 0.05. Results: We found no
      significant differences between the PVC groups for pain during mobilization at
      24-h postoperatively: PVC-Low: 6 (4–8) (median, (IQR)) versus PVC-High: 7 (5–8)
      (median, (IQR)), p = 0.10; and for pain at rest: PVC-Low 2 (0–3) (median, (IQR)) 
      versus PVC-High 3 (2–5) (median, (IQR)), p = 0.12. Other comparisons performed
      between predictive groups did not differ significantly. Conclusions: In this
      prospective cohort study of 102 THA patients, we did not find that preoperative

      congenital heart disease in the offspring in the northeastern Sichuan, China.
LID - 3905
AB  - Nonhereditary factors play an important role in the occurrence of congenital
      heart disease (CHD). This study was to explore the possible parental
      nonhereditary exposure factors relevant to the occurrence of CHD in the
      northeastern Sichuan area. A total of 367 children with CHD and 367 children
      without congenital malformations aged 0 to 14 years old were recruited from the
      Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College and Nanchong Central
      Hospital between March 2016 and November 2018. This study was designed as a
      case-control study with 1:1 frequency matching, in which the parents of cases and
      controls were interviewed with the same questionnaire according to the
      gestational age of the child, maternal age during pregnancy and the same maternal
      race/ethnicity. Then, 322 matched case-control pairs were analysed by SPSS 22.
      Thirty-one suspicious factors were entered into the binary logistic regression
      analysis after univariate regression analysis of 55 factors (alpha = 0.05). The
      analysis results showed that 7 factors were significantly associated with the
      occurrence of CHD. Thus, augmenting maternal mental healthcare, improving the
      quality of drinking water, obtaining adequate nutrition, maintaining a healthy
      physical condition during pregnancy, enhancing parents’ level of knowledge and
      maintaining a healthy lifestyle may lower the occurrence of CHD.

TI  - The neurochemical substrates of habitual and goal-directed control.
LID - 84
AB  - Our daily decisions are governed by the arbitration between goal-directed and
      habitual strategies. However, the neurochemical basis of this arbitration is
      unclear. We assessed the contribution of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and
      opioidergic systems to this balance across reward and loss domains. Thirty-nine
      participants (17 healthy controls, 15 patients with pathological gambling, and 7 
      with binge eating disorder) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) imaging 
      with [18F]FDOPA, [11C]MADAM and [11C]carfentanil to assess presynaptic dopamine, 
      and serotonin transporter and mu-opioid receptor binding potential. Separately,
      participants completed a modified two-step task, which quantifies the degree to
      which decision-making is influenced by goal-directed or habitual strategies. All 
      participants completed a version with reward outcomes; healthy controls
      additionally completed a version with loss outcomes. In the context of rewarding 
      outcomes, we found that greater serotonin transporter binding potential in
      prefrontal regions was associated with habitual control, while greater serotonin 
      transporter binding potential in the putamen was marginally associated with
      goal-directed control; however, the findings were no longer significant when
      controlling for the opposing valence (loss). In blocks with loss outcomes, we
      found that the opioidergic system, specifically greater [11C]carfentanil binding 
      potential, was positively associated with goal-directed control and negatively
      associated with habit-directed control. Our findings illuminate the complex
      neurochemical basis of goal-directed and habitual behavior, implicating
      differential roles for prefrontal and subcortical serotonin in decision-making
      across healthy and pathological populations.

TI  - Evaluating kratom alkaloids using PHASE.
LID - e0229646
AB  - Kratom is a botanical substance that is marketed and promoted in the US for
      pharmaceutical opioid indications despite having no US Food and Drug
      Administration approved uses. Kratom contains over forty alkaloids including two 
      partial agonists at the mu opioid receptor, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine,
      that have been subjected to the FDA’s scientific and medical evaluation. However,
      pharmacological and toxicological data for the remaining alkaloids are limited.
      Therefore, we applied the Public Health Assessment via Structural Evaluation
      (PHASE) protocol to generate in silico binding profiles for 25 kratom alkaloids
      to facilitate the risk evaluation of kratom. PHASE demonstrates that kratom
      alkaloids share structural features with controlled opioids, indicates that
      several alkaloids bind to the opioid, adrenergic, and serotonin receptors, and
      suggests that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are the strongest binders at
      the mu opioid receptor. Subsequently, the in silico binding profiles of a subset 
      of the alkaloids were experimentally verified at the opioid, adrenergic, and
      serotonin receptors using radioligand binding assays. The verified binding
      profiles demonstrate the ability of PHASE to identify potential safety signals
      and provide a tool for prioritizing experimental evaluation of high-risk
      compounds.

      USA: Variations in buprenorphine and methadone treatment by geography,
      operational, and payment characteristics, 2007-16.
LID - e0229787
AB  - Objective: To identify the geographic, organisational, and payment correlates of 
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment among substance abuse treatment (SAT)
      providers. Methods: Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Substance Abuse 
      Treatment Services (NSSATS) from 2007–16 were conducted. We provide bivariate
      descriptive statistics regarding substance abuse treatment services which offered
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment from 2007–16. Using multiple logistic
      regression, we regressed geographic, organisational, and payment correlates on
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment. Results: Buprenorphine is increasingly
      offered at SAT facilities though uptake remains comparatively low outside of the 
      northeast. SAT facilities run by tribal governments or Indian Health Service
      which offer buprenorphine remain low compared to privately operated SAT
      facilities (AOR = 0.528). The odds of offering buprenorphine among facilities
      offering free or no charge treatment (AOR = 0.838) or a sliding fee scale (AOR = 
      0.464) was lower. SAT facilities accepting Medicaid payments showed higher odds
      of offering methadone treatment (AOR = 2.035). Conclusions: Greater attention
      towards the disparities in provision of opioid agonist therapies is warranted,
      especially towards the reasons why uptake has been moderate among civilian
      providers. Additionally, the care needs of Native Americans facing opioid-related
      use disorders bears further scrutiny.

TI  - Illness-related suffering and need for palliative care in Rohingya refugees and
      caregivers in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study.
LID - e1003011
AB  - Background: Despite recognition that palliative care is an essential component of
      any humanitarian response, serious illness-related suffering continues to be
      pervasive in these settings. There is very limited evidence about the need for
      palliative care and symptom relief to guide the implementation of programs to
      alleviate the burden of serious illness-related suffering in these settings. A
      basic package of essential medications and supplies can provide pain relief and
      palliative care; however, the practical availability of these items has not been 
      assessed. This study aimed to describe the illness-related suffering and need for
      palliative care in Rohingya refugees and caregivers in Bangladesh. Methods and
      findings: Between November 20 and 24, 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional study 
      of individuals with serious health problems (n = 156, 53% male) and caregivers (n
      = 155, 69% female) living in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, using
      convenience sampling to recruit participants at the community level (i.e., going 
      house to house to identify eligible individuals). The serious health problems,
      recent healthcare experiences, need for medications and medical supplies, and
      basic needs of participants were explored through interviews with trained
      Rohingya community members, using an interview guide that had been piloted with
      Rohingya individuals to ensure it reflected the specificities of their refugee
      experience and culture. The most common diagnoses were significant physical
      disabilities (n = 100, 64.1%), treatment-resistant tuberculosis (TB) (n = 32,
      20.5%), cancer (n = 15, 9.6%), and HIV infection (n = 3, 1.9%). Many individuals 
      with serious health problems were experiencing significant pain (62%, n = 96),
      and pain treatments were largely ineffective (70%, n = 58). The average age was
      44.8 years (range 2–100 years) for those with serious health problems and 34.9
      years (range 8–75 years) for caregivers. Caregivers reported providing an average
      of 13.8 hours of care per day. Sleep difficulties (87.1%, n = 108), lack of
      appetite (58.1%, n = 72), and lack of pleasure in life (53.2%, n = 66) were the
      most commonly reported problems related to the caregiving role. The main
      limitations of this study were the use of convenience sampling and closed-ended
      interview questioning. Conclusions: In this study we found that many individuals 
      with serious health problems experienced significant physical, emotional, and
      social suffering due to a lack of access to pain and symptom relief and other
      essential components of palliative care. Humanitarian responses should develop
      and incorporate palliative care and symptom relief strategies that address the
      needs of all people with serious illness-related suffering and their caregivers.

TI  - Utility of accumulated opioid supply days and individual patient factors in
      predicting probability of transitioning to long‐term opioid use: An observational
      study in the Veterans Health Administration.
LID - e00571
AB  - Initial supply days dispensed to new users is strongly predictive of future
      long‐term opioid use (LTO). The objective was to examine whether a model
      integrating additional clinical variables conferred meaningful improvement in
      predicting LTO, beyond a simple approach using only accumulated supply. Three
      cohorts were created using Veteran's Health Administration data based on
      accumulated supply days during the 90 days following opioid initiation: (a)
      <30 days, (b) ≥30 days, (c) ≥60 days. A base, unadjusted probability of
      subsequent LTO (days 91‐365) was calculated for each cohort, along with an
      associated risk range based on midpoint values between cohorts. Within each
      cohort, log‐binomial regression modeled the probability of subsequent LTO, using 
      demographic, diagnostic, and medication characteristics. Each patient's LTO
      probability was determined using their individual characteristic values and model
      parameter estimates, where values falling outside the cohort's risk range were
      considered a clinically meaningful change in predictive value. Base probabilities
      for subsequent LTO and associated risk ranges by cohort were as follows: (a)
      3.92% (0%‐10.75%), (b) 17.59% (10.76%‐28.05%), (c) 38.53% (28.06%‐47.55%). The
      proportion of patients whose individual probability fell outside their cohort's
      risk range was as follows: 1.5%, 4.6%, and 9.2% for cohorts 1, 2, and 3,
      respectively. The strong relationship between accumulated supply days and future 
      LTO offers an opportunity to leverage electronic healthcare records for decision 
      support in preventing the initiation of inappropriate LTO through early
      intervention. More complex models are unlikely to meaningfully guide decision
      making beyond the single variable of accumulated supply days.

LID - e53779
AB  - Melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 are involved in synchronizing circadian rhythms
      and are important targets for treating sleep and mood disorders, type-2 diabetes 
      and cancer. Here, we performed large scale structure-based virtual screening for 
      new ligand chemotypes using recently solved high-resolution 3D crystal structures
      of agonist-bound MT receptors. Experimental testing of 62 screening candidates
      yielded the discovery of 10 new agonist chemotypes with sub-micromolar potency at
      MT receptors, with compound 21 reaching EC50 of 0.36 nM. Six of these molecules
      displayed selectivity for MT2 over MT1. Moreover, two most potent agonists,
      including 21 and a close derivative of melatonin, 28, had dramatically reduced
      arrestin recruitment at MT2, while compound 37 was devoid of Gi signaling at MT1,
      implying biased signaling. This study validates the suitability of the
      agonist-bound orthosteric pocket in the MT receptor structures for the
      structure-based discovery of selective agonists.

TI  - Combining Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Transcutaneous Electrical
      Nerve Stimulation to Relieve Persistent Pain in a Patient Suffering from Complex 
      Regional Pain Syndrome: A Case Report.
PG  - 467-73
AB  - Purpose: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare neuropathic pain
      condition characterized by sensory, motor and autonomic alterations. Previous
      investigations have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can alleviate pain in various 
      populations, and that a combination of these treatments could provide greater
      hypoalgesic effects. In the present case report, we describe the effect of tDCS
      and TENS treatment on pain intensity and unpleasantness in a patient suffering
      from chronic CRPS. Results: The patient was a 37-year-old woman, suffering from
      left lower limb CRPS (type I) for more than 5 years. Despite medication
      (pregabalin, tapentadol, duloxetine), rehabilitation treatments (sensorimotor
      retraining, graded motor imagery) and spinal cord stimulation (SCS), the
      participant reported moderate to severe pain. Treatments of tDCS alone (performed
      with SCS turned off during tDCS application, 1 session/day, for 5 consecutive
      days) did not significantly decrease pain. Combining tDCS with TENS (SCS
      temporarily turned off during tDCS, 1 session/day, for 5 consecutive days)
      slightly reduced pain intensity and unpleasantness. Discussion: Our results
      suggest that combining tDCS and TENS could be a therapeutic strategy worth
      investigating further to relieve pain in chronic CRPS patients. Future studies
      should examine the efficacy of combined tDCS and TENS treatments in CRPS
      patients, and other chronic pain conditions, with special attention to the
      cumulative and long-term effects and its effect on function and quality of life.

      upregulation of the CD95/CD95L pathway.
LID - 1744806920908092
AB  - Objectives: To explore the effects of trigeminal neuralgia on neurodegeneration
      in rats and the underlining mechanism. Methods: Sixty adult male Sprague Dawley
      rats were divided randomly into Chronic Constriction Injury of the Rat’s
      Infraorbital Nerve (ION-CCI) group and sham group (n = 30). Right suborbital
      nerve was ligated in ION-CCI group to establish a trigeminal neuralgia model. In 
      sham group, suborbital nerve was exposed without ligation. Pain thresholds were
      measured before surgery and 1, 7, 15, and 30 days after surgery (n = 10). Morris 
      water maze tests (n = 10) were conducted at 1, 15, and 30 days after surgery to
      evaluate the changes in learning and memory ability of rats. At 5, 19, and
      34 days after surgery, serum S100β protein concentration and hippocampal Aβ1-42
      protein expression were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; total tau 
      protein expression was detected by Western blotting; changes of neurons in
      hippocampus were observed by Nissl staining; and the expression of ser404p-tau,
      cluster of differentiation (CD)95, CD95L, and cleaved caspase-3 proteins was
      detected by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Results: Hyperalgesia
      occurred in ION-CCI group, and mechanical pain threshold decreased significantly 
      (P < 0.05). On the 15th and 30th days after surgery, ION-CCI group showed lower
      learning and memory ability than sham group (P < 0.05). Serum S100β protein
      concentration, hippocampal A β1-42, and ser404p-tau protein expression increased 
      in the ION-CCI group 19 and 34 days after surgery (P < 0.05), hippocampal CD95
      expression increased in the ION-CCI group after surgery (P < 0.05), hippocampal
      CD95L expression increased at 19 and 34 days after surgery (P < 0.05), and
      cleaved caspase-3 expression increased at 5 and 19 days after surgery (P < 0.05).
      Nissl bodies in ION-CCI group decreased significantly at 15 days after surgery.
      The expression of cleaved caspase-3 protein in ION-CCI group was positively
      correlated with the expression of CD95 and CD95L (P < 0.05). Conclusions:
      Trigeminal neuralgia may lead to neuronal inflammation and neuronal apoptosis
      associated with upregulation of CD95/CD95L expression, thus causing
      neurodegeneration.

TI  - Scorpion alleviates bone cancer pain through inhibition of bone destruction and
      glia activation.
LID - 1744806920909993
AB  - Background: Bone cancer pain is common in patients with advanced cancers as tumor
      metastasizes to bone. The inefficient clinical treatment severely reduces quality
      of life of bone cancer pain patients. During the pain status, activated spinal
      astrocytes and microglia release various inflammatory cytokines, resulting in
      spinal inflammation and the development of neuron sensitization. Scorpion is the 
      dry body of Buthus martensii Karsch and is often used for various pain management
      in clinical practice. However, its function on bone cancer pain is unclear.
      Methods: We investigated the effects of intragastric administration of scorpion
      on bone cancer pain induced by left tibial cavity injection of Walker 256 cells. 
      Nociceptive behavior was measured using the von Frey filaments test and the
      spontaneous ambulatory pain score. The bone destruction was assessed by tibial
      radiographs. Expression of spinal cord astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acidic
      protein and microglial marker Iba1 was monitored by Western blot assay and
      immunofluorescence. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, and 
      IL-1β was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The proliferation of
      Walker 256 cells was evaluated by CCK8 assay. Results: Intragastric
      administration of scorpion reduced bone cancer pain behavior and relieved bone
      destruction, accompanied by decreased expression of spinal glial fibrillary
      acidic protein and Iba1 protein level and TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β mRNA level.
      Besides, scorpion inhibited proliferation of Walker 256 cells in a dose- and
      time-dependent manner. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that scorpion produces
      an analgesic effect in a rat model of bone cancer pain via inhibiting bone
      destruction and activation of spinal cord astrocytes and microglia.

TI  - Quadratus lumborum block versus transversus abdominis plane block for
      postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 53
AB  - Background: Abdominal surgery is common and is associated with severe
      postoperative pain. The transverse abdominal plane (TAP) block is considered an
      effective means for pain control in such cases. The quadratus lumborum (QL) block
      is another option for the management of postoperative pain. The aim of this study
      was to conduct a meta-analysis and thereby evaluate the efficacy and safety of QL
      blocks and TAP blocks for pain management after abdominal surgery. Methods: We
      comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, the Cochrane Library, Web of
      Science and CNKI for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared QL blocks 
      and TAP blocks for pain management in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. All 
      of the data were screened and evaluated by two researchers. RevMan5.3 was adopted
      for the meta-analysis. Results: A total of 8 RCTs involving 564 patients were
      included. The meta-analysis showed statistically significant differences between 
      the two groups with respect to postoperative pain scores at 2 h (standardized
      mean difference [Std.MD] = − 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] = − 2.63 to
      − 0.89; p < .001), 4 h (Std.MD = -0.77; 95% CI = -1.36 to − 0.18; p = .01),6 h
      (Std.MD = -1.24; 95% CI = -2.31 to − 0.17; p = .02),12 h (Std.MD = -0.70; 95%
      CI = -1.27 to − 0.13; p = .02) and 24 h (Std.MD = -0.65; 95% CI = -1.29 to
      − 0.02; p = .04); postoperative morphine consumption at 24 h (Std.MD = -1.39; 95%
      CI = -1.83 to − 0.95; p < .001); and duration of postoperative analgesia
      (Std.MD = 2.30; 95% CI = 1.85 to 2.75; p < .001). There was no statistically
      significant difference between the two groups with regard to the incidence of
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (RR = 0.55;95% CI = 0.27 to
      1.14;p = 0.11). Conclusion: The QL block provides better pain management with
      less opioid consumption than the TAP block after abdominal surgery. In addition, 
      there are no differences between the TAP block and QL block with respect to PONV.

      relevant data of 864 patients (ASA 1 or 2, aged 18–65 years, body mass index
      < 30 kg m− 2). Four regimens (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 mg kg− 1) were compared with
      1.0 mg kg− 1 in at least three trials each, and three (0.8, 1.5, 2 mg kg− 1) in
      one each. With 0.3 to 0.5 mg kg− 1, the likelihood of excellent intubating
      conditions was significantly decreased (ARD − 22% to − 67%). With 0.3 and
      0.4 mg kg− 1, but not with 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.5 and 2.0 mg kg− 1, the likelihood of
      unacceptable intubating conditions was significantly increased (ARD + 22%
      and + 32%, respectively). With 2.0 mg kg− 1, but not with 0.8 or 1.5 mg kg− 1,
      the likelihood of excellent intubating conditions was significantly increased
      (ARD + 23%). Apnoea times were significantly shorter with regimens ≤0.8 mg kg− 1 
      (MD − 1.0 to − 3.4 min) but were not reported with 1.5 or 2.0 mg kg− 1.
      Conclusions: With succinylcholine regimens ≤0.5 mg kg− 1, excellent intubating
      conditions are less likely and apnoea times are shorter, compared with
      1 mg kg− 1. With 0.3 and 0.4 mg kg− 1, unacceptable intubating conditions are
      more common. Succinylcholine 1.5 mg kg− 1 does not produce more often excellent
      conditions compared with 1 mg kg− 1, while 2.0 mg kg− 1 does, but the database
      with these regimens is weak and apnoea times remain unknown. Limited information 
      size and strong statistical heterogeneity decrease the certainty of the evidence.

      Opioid Prescribing Among Medicare Beneficiaries.
LID - e200274
AB  - Question: Are Medicare Part D formulary exclusions and restrictions for opioid
      alternatives associated with increases in opioid prescribing? Findings: Using
      county-level panel data throughout the United States, it was found that for each 
      additional opioid alternative not covered in a county, the rate of opioid
      prescribing increased by 2.2% to 3.7% relative to the mean opioid prescribing
      rate. Formulary restrictions in the form of utilization management strategies and
      high-cost tier placements for opioid alternatives were not associated with
      increases in opioid prescribing. Meaning: The findings of this study suggest that
      lack of coverage of opioid alternatives may encourage higher rates of opioid
      prescribing.

TI  - Modulation of feeding behavior and metabolism by dynorphin.
LID - 3821
AB  - The neuronal regulation of metabolic and behavioral responses to different diets 
      and feeding regimens is an important research area. Herein, we investigated if
      the opioid peptide dynorphin modulates feeding behavior and metabolism. Mice
      lacking dynorphin peptides (KO) were exposed to either a normal diet (ND) or a
      high-fat diet (HFD) for a period of 12 weeks. Additionally, mice had either
      time-restricted (TR) or ad libitum (AL) access to food. Body weight, food intake 
      and blood glucose levels were monitored throughout the 12-week feeding schedule. 
      Brain samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to detect changes in the
      expression levels of hypothalamic peptides. As expected, animals on HFD or having
      AL access to food gained more weight than mice on ND or having TR access.
      Unexpectedly, KO females on TR HFD as well as KO males on AL ND or AL HFD
      demonstrated a significantly increased body weight gain compared to the
      respective WT groups. The calorie intake differed only marginally between the
      genotypes: a significant difference was present in the female ND AL group, where 
      dynorphin KO mice ate more than WT mice. Although female KO mice on a TR feeding 
      regimen consumed a similar amount of food as WT controls, they displayed
      significantly higher levels of blood glucose. We observed significantly reduced
      levels of hypothalamic orexigenic peptides neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexin-A in
      KO mice. This decrease became particularly pronounced in the HFD groups and under
      AL condition. The kappa opiod receptor (KOR) levels were higher after HFD
      compared to ND feeding in the ventral pallidum of WT mice. We hypothesize that
      HFD enhances dynorphin signaling in this hedonic center to maintain energy
      homeostasis, therefore KO mice have a more pronounced phenotype in the HFD
      condition due to the lack of it. Our data suggest that dynorphin modulates
      metabolic changes associated with TR feeding regimen and HFD consumption. We
      conclude that the lack of dynorphin causes uncoupling between energy intake and
      body weight gain in mice; KO mice maintained on HFD become overweight despite
      their normal food intake. Thus, using kappa opioid receptor agonists against
      obesity could be considered as a potential treatment strategy.

TI  - Nanobody-enabled monitoring of kappa opioid receptor states.
LID - 1145
AB  - Recent studies show that GPCRs rapidly interconvert between multiple states
      although our ability to interrogate, monitor and visualize them is limited by a
      relative lack of suitable tools. We previously reported two nanobodies (Nb39 and 
      Nb6) that stabilize distinct ligand- and efficacy-delimited conformations of the 
      kappa opioid receptor. Here, we demonstrate via X-ray crystallography a
      nanobody-targeted allosteric binding site by which Nb6 stabilizes a
      ligand-dependent inactive state. As Nb39 stabilizes an active-like state, we show
      how these two state-dependent nanobodies can provide real-time reporting of
      ligand stabilized states in cells in situ. Significantly, we demonstrate that
      chimeric GPCRs can be created with engineered nanobody binding sites to report
      ligand-stabilized states. Our results provide both insights regarding potential
      mechanisms for allosterically modulating KOR with nanobodies and a tool for
      reporting the real-time, in situ dynamic range of GPCR activity.

TI  - Associations of adverse childhood experiences with educational attainment and
      adolescent health and the role of family and socioeconomic factors: A prospective
      cohort study in the UK.
LID - e1003031
AB  - Background: Experiencing multiple adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is a risk 
      factor for many adverse outcomes. We explore associations of ACEs with
      educational attainment and adolescent health and the role of family and
      socioeconomic factors in these associations. Methods and findings: Using data
      from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective 
      cohort of children born in southwest England in 1991–1992, we assess associations
      of ACEs between birth and 16 years (sexual, physical, or emotional abuse;
      emotional neglect; parental substance abuse; parental mental illness or suicide
      attempt; violence between parents; parental separation; bullying; and parental
      criminal conviction, with data collected on multiple occasions between birth and 
      age 16) with educational attainment at 16 years (n = 9,959) and health at age 17 
      years (depression, obesity, harmful alcohol use, smoking, and illicit drug use; n
      = 4,917). We explore the extent to which associations are robust to adjustment
      for family and socioeconomic factors (home ownership, mother and partner’s
      highest educational qualification, household social class, parity, child’s
      ethnicity, mother’s age, mother’s marital status, mother’s depression score at 18
      and 32 weeks gestation, and mother’s partner’s depression score at 18 weeks
      gestation) and whether associations differ according to socioeconomic factors,
      and we estimate the proportion of adverse educational and health outcomes
      attributable to ACEs or family or socioeconomic measures. Among the 9,959
      participants (49.5% female) included in analysis of educational outcomes, 84%
      reported at least one ACE, 24% reported 4 or more ACEs, and 54.5% received 5 or
      more General Certificates of Secondary Education (GCSEs) at grade C or above,
      including English and Maths. Among the 4,917 participants (50.1% female) included
      in analysis of health outcomes, 7.3% were obese, 8.7% had depression, 19.5%
      reported smoking, 16.1% reported drug use, and 10.9% reported harmful alcohol
      use. There were associations of ACEs with lower educational attainment and higher
      risk of depression, drug use, and smoking. For example, odds ratios (ORs) for 4+ 
      ACEs compared with no ACEs after adjustment for confounders were depression, 2.4 
      (1.6–3.8, p < 0.001); drug use, 3.1 (2.1–4.4, p < 0.001); and smoking, 2.3
      (1.7–3.1, p < 0.001). Associations with educational attainment attenuated after
      adjustment but remained strong; for example, the OR after adjustment for
      confounders for low educational attainment comparing 4+ ACEs with no ACEs was 2.0
      (1.7–2.4, p < 0.001). Associations with depression, drug use, and smoking were
      not altered by adjustment. Associations of ACEs with harmful alcohol use and
      obesity were weak. For example, ORs for 4+ ACEs compared with no ACEs after
      adjustment for confounders were harmful alcohol use, 1.4 (0.9–2.0, p = 0.10) and 
      obesity, 1.4 (0.9–2.2, p = 0.13) We found no evidence that socioeconomic factors 
      modified the associations of ACEs with educational or health outcomes. Population
      attributable fractions (PAFs) for the adverse educational and health outcomes
      range from 5%–15% for 4+ ACEs and 1%–19% for low maternal education. Using data
      from multiple questionnaires across a long period of time enabled us to capture a
      detailed picture of the cohort members’ experience of ACEs; however, a limitation
      of our study is that this resulted in a high proportion of missing data, and our 
      analyses assume data are missing at random. Conclusions: This study demonstrates 
      associations between ACEs and lower educational attainment and higher risks of
      depression, drug use, and smoking that remain after adjustment for family and
      socioeconomic factors. The low PAFs for both ACEs and socioeconomic factors imply
      that interventions that focus solely on ACEs or solely on socioeconomic
      deprivation, whilst beneficial, would miss most cases of adverse educational and 
      health outcomes. This interpretation suggests that intervention strategies should
      target a wide range of relevant factors, including ACEs, socioeconomic
      deprivation, parental substance use, and mental health.

TI  - Hoffmann’s syndrome necessitating forearm fasciotomy: a case report.
LID - 38
AB  - Background: Hoffmann’s syndrome is a rare form of hypothyroid myopathy. Only a
      few cases of fasciotomy in this setting have previously been reported. Case
      presentation: A 41-year-old Caucasian man under treatment for hypothyroidism
      presented with acute-onset severe pain in his forearm for no obvious reason and
      was admitted to our emergency room. He eventually developed compartment syndrome 
      which necessitated surgical decompression. Soon after surgery he complained of
      similar symptoms in his calves. By the time his hypothyroid status was confirmed,
      conservative treatment and orally administered levothyroxine gradually made the
      pain from his calves disappear, without further surgical treatment. Conclusion:
      Hoffmann’s syndrome may precipitate a compartment syndrome in the absence of
      trauma.

TI  - Predicting Opioid Use Following Discharge After Cesarean Delivery.
PG  - 118-26
AB  - PURPOSE: Although cesarean delivery is the most common surgical procedure in the 
      United States, postoperative opioid prescribing varies greatly. We hypothesized
      that patient characteristics, procedural characteristics, or both would be
      associated with high vs low opioid use after discharge. This information could
      help individualize prescriptions. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we
      quantified opioid use for 4 weeks following hospital discharge after cesarean
      delivery. Predischarge characteristics were obtained from health records, and
      patients self-reported total opioid use postdischarge on weekly questionnaires.
      Opioid use was quantified in milligram morphine equivalents (MMEs). Binomial and 
      Poisson regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of opioid use
      after discharge. RESULTS: Of the 233 patients starting the study, 203 (87.1%)
      completed at least 1 questionnaire and were included in analyses (86.3% completed
      all 4 questionnaires). A total of 113 patients were high users (>75 MMEs) and 90 
      patients were low users (≤75 MMEs) of opioids postdischarge. The group reporting 
      low opioid use received on average 44% fewer opioids in the 24 hours before
      discharge compared with the group reporting high opioid use (mean = 33.0 vs 59.3 
      MMEs, P <.001). Only a minority of patients (11.4% to 15.8%) stored leftover
      opioids in a locked location, and just 31 patients disposed of leftover opioids. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of predischarge opioid use can be useful as a tool to
      inform individualized opioid prescriptions, help optimize nonopioid analgesia,
      and reduce opioid use. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the impact of
      implementing such measures on prescribing practices, pain, and functional
      outcomes.

TI  - Maternity Care and Buprenorphine Prescribing in New Family Physicians.
PG  - 156-8
AB  - The American Board of Family Medicine routinely surveys its Diplomates in each
      national graduating cohort 3 years out of training. These data were used to
      characterize early career family physicians whose services include management of 
      pregnancy and prescribing buprenorphine. A total of 261 (5.1%) respondents both
      provide maternity care and prescribe buprenorphine. Family physicians who care
      for pregnant women and also prescribe buprenorphine represented 50.4% of all
      buprenorphine prescribers. The family physicians in this group were trained in a 
      small number of residency programs, with only 15 programs producing at least 25% 
      of graduates who do this work.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of an infusion pump or standard IV push injection to
      deliver naloxone in treatment of opioid toxicity.
PG  - 38-43
AB  - Background:: The optimal goal of naloxone infusion in intensive care units is to 
      ameliorate opioid-induced side effects in therapy or eliminate the symptoms of
      opioid toxicity in overdoses. Accurately monitoring and regulating the doses is
      critical to prevent adverse effects related to naloxone administration. The
      present study aimed to compare treatment outcomes when using two methods of
      intravenous naloxone infusion: an infusion pump or the standard method. Methods::
      This study involved 80 patients with signs and symptoms of opioid overdose. The
      patients were randomly assigned into two groups with respect to intravenous
      infusion of naloxone by either an infusion pump or the standard method. Results::
      Comparison of study parameters between the two groups at 12 and 24 hours after
      intervention showed significantly more compensatory acid-base imbalance in the
      naloxone infusion pump group. In the group that received naloxone by pump, only
      one patient experienced withdrawal symptoms, but withdrawal symptoms appeared in 
      12 patients (30.0%) in the standard intravenous infusion group within 12 hours
      and in seven additional patients (17.5%) within 24 hours of intervention. In the 
      group receiving pump-based naloxone infusion therapy, no another complications
      were reported; however in the standard infusion group, the 12-hour and 24-hour
      complication rates were 55.0% and 32.5%, respectively. The length of hospital
      stay was 2.85±1.05 and 4.22±0.92 days for the pump and standard infusion groups, 
      respectively (P<0.001). Conclusions:: Naloxone infusion using an infusion pump
      may be safer with regard to hemodynamic stability, resulting in shorter
      hospitalization periods, and fewer posttreatment complications.

TI  - The spinal microglial IL-10/β-endorphin pathway accounts for cinobufagin-induced 
      mechanical antiallodynia in bone cancer pain following activation of α7-nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptors.
LID - 75
AB  - Background: Cinobufagin is the major bufadienolide of Bufonis venenum (Chansu),
      which has been traditionally used for the treatment of chronic pain especially
      cancer pain. The current study aimed to evaluate its antinociceptive effects in
      bone cancer pain and explore the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Rat bone cancer 
      model was used in this study. The withdrawal threshold evoked by stimulation of
      the hindpaw was determined using a 2290 CE electrical von Frey hair. The
      β-endorphin and IL-10 levels were measured in the spinal cord and cultured
      primary microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Results: Cinobufagin, given
      intrathecally, dose-dependently attenuated mechanical allodynia in bone cancer
      pain rats, with the projected Emax of 90% MPE and ED50 of 6.4 μg. Intrathecal
      cinobufagin also stimulated the gene and protein expression of IL-10 and
      β-endorphin (but not dynorphin A) in the spinal cords of bone cancer pain rats.
      In addition, treatment with cinobufagin in cultured primary spinal microglia but 
      not astrocytes or neurons stimulated the mRNA and protein expression of IL-10 and
      β-endorphin, which was prevented by the pretreatment with the IL-10 antibody but 
      not β-endorphin antiserum. Furthermore, spinal cinobufagin-induced mechanical
      antiallodynia was inhibited by the pretreatment with intrathecal injection of the
      microglial inhibitor minocycline, IL-10 antibody, β-endorphin antiserum and
      specific μ-opioid receptor antagonist CTAP. Lastly, cinobufagin- and the specific
      α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) agonist PHA-543613-induced
      microglial gene expression of IL-10/β-endorphin and mechanical antiallodynia in
      bone cancer pain were blocked by the pretreatment with the specific α7-nAChR
      antagonist methyllycaconitine. Conclusions: Our results illustrate that
      cinobufagin produces mechanical antiallodynia in bone cancer pain through spinal 
      microglial expression of IL-10 and subsequent β-endorphin following activation of
      α7-nAChRs. Our results also highlight the broad significance of the recently
      uncovered spinal microglial IL-10/β-endorphin pathway in antinociception.

TI  - Applying the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
      framework to determine the predictors of falls and fractures in people with
      osteoarthritis or at high risk of developing osteoarthritis: data from the
      Osteoarthritis Initiative.
LID - 138
AB  - Background: Falls are a major cause of injury and death among older people.
      Evidence suggests that people with osteoarthritis (OA) are at a higher risk of
      falls and fall-related injuries including fractures. While studies demonstrate a 
      link between OA and falls, little is known about the pathways that link falls
      with demographic factors, OA impairments, activity limitations and participation 
      restrictions. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for falls and
      fractures among people with OA or at high risk of developing OA using the
      International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)
      framework. Methods: A longitudinal analysis of data from the Osteoarthritis
      Initiative (OAI) dataset was undertaken. Participants were considered to have OA 
      if they reported they had been diagnosed with knee or hip OA by a medical
      practitioner. Outcomes were self-reported falls and fractures. Potential
      predictors were classified using the ICF framework. Poisson regression models
      were used to determine the risk factors for falls and fractures. Results: Of the 
      4796 participants, 2270 (47%) were diagnosed with knee and/or hip OA. A higher
      proportion of participants with OA reported having had falls (72% vs 63%;
      p < 0.0001) and fractures (17% vs 14%; p = 0.012) than those without OA. Personal
      factors were found to be stronger predictors of falls and fractures compared to
      OA impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions in this
      sample of participants. After adjusting for potential covariates, self-reported
      history of falls was a significant predictor of both increased falls (incidence
      rate ratio [IRR] 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40, 4.60) and fracture risk
      (IRR 1.38; 95% CI 1.13, 1.69). Conclusions: By applying the ICF framework, we
      have shown that personal factors were more likely to predict falls and fractures 
      rather than OA impairments, environmental factors, activity limitations and
      participation restrictions in people with OA or at high risk of developing OA.
      This highlights the importance of questioning patients about their previous falls
      and past medical history, and using this information to focus our assessment and 
      clinical decision-making processes.

TI  - Elevated Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio in Older Adults with Cocaine Use Disorder
      as a Marker of Chronic Inflammation.
PG  - 32-40
AB  - Objective: The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a non-specific,
      easy-to-obtain marker of inflammation associated with morbidity and mortality in 
      systemic, psychiatric, and age-related inflammatory conditions. Given the growing
      trend of substance use disorder (SUD) in older adults, and the relationship
      between inflammation and SUD elevated NLR may serve as a useful inflammatory
      biomarker of the combined burden of aging and SUD. The present study focused on
      cocaine use disorder (CUD) to examine if cocaine adds further inflammatory burden
      among older adults, by comparing NLR values between older adults with CUD and a
      non-cocaine using, aged-matched, nationally representative sample. Methods: The
      dataset included 107 (86% male) participants (aged 50–65 years) with cocaine use 
      disorder. NLR was derived from complete blood count tests by dividing the
      absolute value of peripheral neutrophil concentration by lymphocyte
      concentration. For comparison, we extracted data from age-matched adults without 
      CUD using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Individuals with 
      immunocompromising conditions were excluded (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and
      sexually transmitted infections such as HIV). A doubly-robust inverse
      probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) propensity score method was
      used to estimate group differences on NLR while controlling for potential
      confounding variables (age, gender, race, income, nicotine, marijuana and alcohol
      use). Results: The IPWRA model revealed that the CUD sample had significantly
      elevated NLR in comparison to non-cocaine users, with a moderate effect size (β
      weight = 0.67). Conclusion: Although non-specific, NLR represents a readily
      obtainable inflammatory marker for SUD research. CUD may add further inflammatory
      burden to aging cocaine users.

TI  - Age-related Effects of Heroin on Gene Expression in the Hippocampus and Striatum 
      of Cynomolgus Monkeys.
PG  - 93-108
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate differentially expressed
      genes and their functions in the hippocampus and striatum after heroin
      administration in cynomolgus macaques of different ages. Methods: Cynomolgus
      monkeys were divided by age as follows: 1 year (A1, n = 2); 3 to 4 years (A2, n =
      2); 6 to 8 years (A3, n = 2); and older than 11 years (A4, n = 2). After heroin
      was injected intramuscularly into the monkeys (0.6 mg/kg), we performed
      large-scale transcriptome profiling in the hippocampus (H) and striatum (S) using
      RNA sequencing technology. Some genes were validated with real-time quantitative 
      PCR. Results: In the hippocampus, the gene expression of A1H was similar to that 
      of A4H, while the gene expression of A2H was similar to that of A3H. Genes
      associated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (STMN1,
      FGF14, and MAPT) and γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic synapses (GABBR2 and GAD1) were
      differentially expressed among control and heroin-treated animals. Differential
      gene expression between A1S and A4S was the least significant, while differential
      gene expression between A3S and A2S was the most significant. Genes associated
      with the neurotrophin signaling pathway (NTRK1 and NGFR), autophagy (ATG5), and
      dopaminergic synapses (AKT1) in the striatum were differentially expressed among 
      control and heroin-treated animals. Conclusion: These results suggest that even a
      single heroin exposure can cause differential gene expression in the hippocampus 
      and striatum of nonhuman primates at different ages.

TI  - ALDH2 Gene: Its Effects on the Neuropsychological Functions in Patients with
      Opioid Use Disorder Undergoing Methadone Maintenance Treatment.
PG  - 136-44
AB  - Objective: Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) have impaired attention,
      inhibition control, and memory function. The aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2 )
      gene has been associated with OUD and ALDH2 gene polymorphisms may affect
      aldehyde metabolism and cognitive function in other substance use disorder.
      Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether ALDH2 genotypes have significant
      effects on neuropsychological functions in OUD patients undergoing methadone
      maintenance therapy (MMT). Methods: OUD patients undergoing MMT were investigated
      and followed-up for 12 weeks. ALDH2 gene polymorphisms were genotyped. Connors’
      Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R)
      were administered at baseline and after 12 weeks of MMT. Multivariate linear
      regressions and generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to examine the 
      correlation between the ALDH2 genotypes and performance on the CPTs and WMS-R.
      Results: We enrolled 86 patients at baseline; 61 patients completed the
      end-of-study assessments. The GEE analysis showed that, after the 12 weeks of
      MMT, OUD patients with the ALDH2 *1/*2+*2/*2 (ALDH2 inactive) genotypes had
      significantly higher commission error T-scores (p = 0.03), significantly lower
      hit reaction time T-scores (p = 0.04), and significantly lower WMS-R visual
      memory index scores (p = 0.03) than did patients with the ALDH2 1 */*1 (ALDH2
      active) genotype. Conclusion: OUD patients with the ALDH2 inactive genotypes
      performed worse in cognitive domains of attention, impulse control, and memory
      than did those with the ALDH2 active genotype. We conclude that the ALDH2 gene is
      important in OUD and is associated with neuropsychological performance after MMT.

TI  - Hepatic Cyst: An Unusual Suspect of Syncope.
LID - 1659718
AB  - The patient is a 75-year-old man with history of diabetes and hypertension who
      presented with syncope after experiencing sharp, 10/10 right flank and abdominal 
      pain worsening over three weeks associated with decreased appetite. Physical
      examination revealed hepatomegaly and right lower quadrant (RUQ) tenderness,
      negative for peritoneal signs. Bloodwork showed leukocytosis (13 K/mcl), alkaline
      phosphatase (141 U/L), total bilirubin (2.0 mg/dL), and gamma-glutamyl
      transferase (172 U/L). Computed Tomography (CT) revealed multiple hepatic cysts
      with the largest measuring 17 × 14 × 18 cm (Figure 1). Parenteral opiates
      provided minimal relief. Cardiac and neurologic etiologies of syncope were ruled 
      out. The patient's course was complicated by opioid-induced delirium as his
      abdominal pain progressively worsened despite escalating doses of parenteral and 
      oral analgesics. Gastroenterology and interventional radiology consulted to
      evaluate for Glisson's capsular stretch. Therapeutic aspiration yielded 2.5 L of 
      serous fluid, which alleviated the patient's pain. Cytology was negative for
      malignancy. Opiates were titrated down. Repeat CT (Figure 2) showed cysts that
      were significantly reduced in size. The patient showed complete resolution of
      symptoms and was subsequently discharged. We present a rare case of a large
      hepatic cyst causing syncope. In the appropriate clinical setting, syncope with
      RUQ tenderness and hepatomegaly should raise the index of suspicion for hepatic
      cysts.

TI  - Minimal Open Access Ileocolic Resection in Complicated Crohn's Disease of the
      Terminal Ileum.
LID - 6019435
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility to undertake an
      ileocolic resection in complex Crohn's disease using a minimal open abdominal
      access using standard laparoscopic instruments. The incision was carried out over
      the previous McBurney scar, with a mean length of 6 cm. Seventy-two patients with
      complicated Crohn's disease underwent IC resection in the considered period; 12
      patients had a McBurney scar due to a previous appendectomy and represented the
      group of study. Feasibility and safety of the procedure were evaluated. Clinical 
      data and outcome were compared with a control arm of 15 patients who had a
      standard laparoscopic IC resection, pooled out from our database among those who 
      had a McBurney incision as service incision. Mean operative time and
      postoperative stay were significantly shorter in the study group. Blood loss and 
      operative costs were also lower in the study group but did not reach statistical 
      significance. Minimal open access ileocolic resection (MOAIR) through a small
      McBurney incision seems safe and feasible in complex Crohn's disease. Some
      advantages over standard laparoscopic surgery could be found in surgical outcomes
      and costs.

TI  - Effectiveness of the First German-Language Group Psychotherapy Manual to
      Accompany Short-Term Treatment in Methamphetamine Dependence.
LID - 130
AB  - Background: Methamphetamine abuse is expanding in Europe, leading to a shortfall 
      in medical care for related disorders in many regions. Research focusing on the
      effectiveness and feasibility of methamphetamine-specific treatment programs is
      scarce, especially in short-term settings.Methods: To this end, we treated 31
      patients with methamphetamine dependence using a new group psychotherapy manual
      added to standard psychiatric care. Trained research assistants recorded
      demographic, illness and treatment variables using a standardized interview at
      baseline and a follow-up visit 3 months later. Outcome and process variables for 
      this intervention encompassing 15 modules for qualified detoxification and
      motivation of patients with methamphetamine dependence are reported.Results:
      Retention and abstinence rates as well as acceptance and feasibility in daily
      routine were assessed positively. Patients with an unsuccessful outcome were
      characterized by longer regular methamphetamine use (t = −2.513, df = 29, p =
      0.018) and a shorter abstinence period at baseline (U = 74.500, z = −1.808, p =
      0.072). Among the demographic and clinical variables, the only predictor
      significantly increasing the odds of a successful outcome was a shorter period of
      regular methamphetamine use (OR = 1.318, CI 95% for OR = 1.021–1.700, b = 0.276, 
      SE = 0.130, p = 0.034).Conclusions: This freely available therapy manual can help
      counter the shortfall in available psychotherapeutic interventions for patients
      with methamphetamine dependence in German-speaking countries. The routinely
      assessed parameters duration of regular methamphetamine use and abstinence before
      treatment were associated with outcome and may be used to personalize therapeutic
      strategies.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine Improves Cardiovascular and Ventilatory Outcomes in Critically
      Ill Patients: Basic and Clinical Approaches.
LID - 1641
AB  - Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective α2-adrenergic agonist with sedative
      and analgesic properties, with minimal respiratory effects. It is used as a
      sedative in the intensive care unit and the operating room. The opioid-sparing
      effect and the absence of respiratory effects make dexmedetomidine an attractive 
      adjuvant drug for anesthesia in obese patients who are at an increased risk for
      postoperative respiratory complications. The pharmacodynamic effects on the
      cardiovascular system are known; however the mechanisms that induce
      cardioprotection are still under study. Regarding the pharmacokinetics
      properties, this drug is extensively metabolized in the liver by the uridine
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases. It has a relatively high hepatic extraction
      ratio, and therefore, its metabolism is dependent on liver blood flow. This
      review shows, from a basic clinical approach, the evidence supporting the use of 
      dexmedetomidine in different settings, from its use in animal models of
      ischemia-reperfusion, and cardioprotective signaling pathways. In addition,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies in obese subjects and the
      management of patients subjected to mechanical ventilation are described.
      Moreover, the clinical efficacy of delirium incidence in patients with indication
      of non-invasive ventilation is shown. Finally, the available evidence from DEX is
      described by a group of Chilean pharmacologists and clinicians who have worked
      for more than 10 years on DEX.

TI  - Physical and Pharmacological Restraints in Hospital Care: Protocol for a
      Systematic Review.
LID - 921
AB  - Background: Physical and pharmacological restraints, defined as all measures
      limiting a person in his or her freedom, are extensively used to handle unsafe or
      problematic behavior in hospital care. There are increasing concerns as to the
      extent with which these restraints are being used in hospitals, and whether their
      benefits outweigh their potential harm. There is currently no comprehensive
      literature overview on the beneficial and/or adverse effects of the use of
      physical and pharmacological restraints in the hospital setting. Methods: A
      systematic review of the existing literature will be performed on the beneficial 
      and/or adverse effects of physical and pharmacological restraints in the hospital
      setting. Relevant databases will be systematically searched. A dedicated search
      strategy was composed. A visualization of similarities (VOS) analysis was used to
      further specify the search. Observational studies, and if available, randomized
      controlled trials reporting on beneficial and/or adverse effects of physical
      and/or pharmacological restraints in the general hospital setting will be
      included. Data from included articles will be extracted and analyzed. If the data
      is suitable for quantitative analysis, meta-analysis will be applied. Discussion:
      This review will provide data on the beneficial and/or adverse effects of the use
      of physical and pharmacological restraints in hospital care. With this review we 
      aim to guide health professionals by providing a critique of the available
      evidence regarding their choice to either apply or withhold from using
      restraints. A limitation of the current review will be that we will not
      specifically address ethical aspects of restraint use. Nevertheless, the outcomes
      of our systematic review can be used in the composition of a multidisciplinary
      guideline. Furthermore, our systematic review might determine knowledge gaps in
      the evidence, and recommendations on how to target these gaps with future
      research. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO registration number:
      CRD42019116186.

TI  - Chronic Inflammatory Lameness Increases Cytokine Concentration in the Spinal Cord
      of Dairy Cows.
LID - 125
AB  - Lameness in dairy cows is an extremely painful multifactorial condition that
      affects the welfare of animals and economically impacts the dairy industry
      worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the profile of cytokines in the
      spinal cord dorsal horn of dairy cows with painful chronic inflammatory lameness.
      Concentrations of 10 cytokines were measured in the spinal cord of seven adult
      dairy cows with chronic lameness and seven adult dairy cows with no lameness. In 
      all cows lameness was evaluated using a mobility scoring system and registered
      accordingly. Immediately after euthanasia the spinal cord was removed and 20 cm
      of lumbar segments (L2–L5) were obtained. After dorsal horn removal and
      processing, cytokine quantification of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α),
      interleukin-1alpha (IL-1α), interleukin 13 (IL-13), chemokine-10 (CXCL10/IP-10), 
      chemokine-9 (CXCL9/MIG), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ),
      interleukin-21 (IL-21), interleukin-36ra (IL-36ra), and macrophage inflammatory
      protein-1 beta (MIP-1β) was performed using a multiplex array. Lame cows had
      higher concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1-α, IL-13, CXCL10, CXCL9, IFN-α, and IFN-γ in
      their dorsal horn compared to non-lame cows, while IL-21 concentration was
      decreased. No differences in IL-36ra and MIP-1β concentrations between lame and
      non-lame cows were observed. Painful chronic inflammation of the hoof in dairy
      cows leads to a marked increase in cytokine concentration in the dorsal horn of
      the spinal cord, which could represent a state of neuroinflammation of the
      Central Nervous System (CNS).

TI  - Comparison of safety and analgesic efficacy of diclofenac sodium with etodolac
      after surgical extraction of third molars: a randomized, double-blind,
      double-dummy, parallel-group study.
PG  - 19-27
AB  - Background: Surgical extraction of third molars is associated with postoperative 
      pain and swelling at the extraction site. Pain is commonly managed using
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Postoperative pain is usually
      moderate to severe in the first 12 h postoperatively and lasts for 3–5 days.
      However, with NSAIDs, these symptoms usually subside within 24 h. Diclofenac
      sodium and etodolac are NSAIDs, more selectively cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors,
      with good analgesic efficacies. Methods: We compared the safety and analgesic
      efficacy of diclofenac sodium with etodolac peroral after surgical extraction of 
      third molars in a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. The
      subjective pain improvement and pain relief after 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h using
      the visual analogue scale were measured as the study outcome. Results: Etodolac
      was equivalent to diclofenac sodium in pain alleviation at all postoperative time
      periods. No significant differences were found between diclofenac sodium and
      etodolac groups (P > 0.05). Both study medications were well tolerated and safe
      with mild adverse effects in only a few participants. Conclusion: Diclofenac
      sodium and etodolac are comparable in terms of analgesic efficacy and safety
      after surgical removal of third molars.

TI  - Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Reduced Early Postoperative Pain after
      Robot-assisted Prostatectomy: a Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 3761
AB  - Analgesic effect of transversus abdominis plane block (TAP block) in lower major 
      abdominal laparoscopic surgery with about 5 cm of maximum surgical scar has been 
      controversial. We hypothesized that TAP block has benefits, so the analgesic
      effect of TAP block after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) was
      evaluated. One hundred patients were enrolled in this prospective,
      double-blinded, randomized study. Standardized general anesthesia with wound
      infiltration on camera port and fentanyl dose limit of 3 µg/kg was provided.
      Ultrasound-guided, single-shot subcostal TAP block with either 0.375% ropivacaine
      (Ropivacaine group, 48 patients) or normal saline (Control group, 52 patients)
      was performed by anesthesiologist in charge (34 anesthesiologists) after surgical
      procedure. Pain score using numerical rating scale (NRS) and postoperative
      intravenous fentanyl were evaluated for the first 24 postoperative hours. Median 
      values (interquartile range) of NRS scores when the patients were transferred to 
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) were 5 (2–7) in Ropivacaine group and 6 (4–8) in
      Control group at rest (P = 0.03), 5 (2–8) in Ropivacaine group and 7 (5–8) in
      Control group during movement (P < 0.01). These significant differences
      disappeared at the time of discharging PACU. Fentanyl doses for the first 24
      postoperative hours were 210 µg (120–360) in Ropivacaine group and 200 µg
      (120–370) in Control group (P = 0.79). These results indicated that subcostal TAP
      block by anesthesiologists of varied level of training reduced postoperative pain
      immediate after RALP. TAP block had fundamental analgesic effect, but this
      benefit was too small to reduce postoperative 24-hour fentanyl consumption.

TI  - An adaptable implementation package targeting evidence-based indicators in
      primary care: A pragmatic cluster-randomised evaluation.
LID - e1003045
AB  - Background: In primary care, multiple priorities and system pressures make
      closing the gap between evidence and practice challenging. Most implementation
      studies focus on single conditions, limiting generalisability. We compared an
      adaptable implementation package against an implementation control and assessed
      effects on adherence to four different evidence-based quality indicators. Methods
      and findings: We undertook two parallel, pragmatic cluster-randomised trials
      using balanced incomplete block designs in general practices in West Yorkshire,
      England. We used ‘opt-out’ recruitment, and we randomly assigned practices that
      did not opt out to an implementation package targeting either diabetes control or
      risky prescribing (Trial 1); or blood pressure (BP) control or anticoagulation in
      atrial fibrillation (AF) (Trial 2). Within trials, each arm acted as the
      implementation control comparison for the other targeted indicator. For example, 
      practices assigned to the diabetes control package acted as the comparison for
      practices assigned to the risky prescribing package. The implementation package
      embedded behaviour change techniques within audit and feedback, educational
      outreach, and computerised support, with content tailored to each indicator.
      Respective patient-level primary endpoints at 11 months comprised the following: 
      achievement of all recommended levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BP, and
      cholesterol; risky prescribing levels; achievement of recommended BP; and
      anticoagulation prescribing. Between February and March 2015, we recruited 144
      general practices collectively serving over 1 million patients. We stratified
      computer-generated randomisation by area, list size, and pre-intervention outcome
      achievement. In April 2015, we randomised 80 practices to Trial 1 (40 per arm)
      and 64 to Trial 2 (32 per arm). Practices and trial personnel were not blind to
      allocation. Two practices were lost to follow-up but provided some outcome data. 
      We analysed the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, adjusted for potential
      confounders at patient level (sex, age) and practice level (list size, locality, 
      pre-intervention achievement against primary outcomes, total quality scores, and 
      levels of patient co-morbidity), and analysed cost-effectiveness. The
      implementation package reduced risky prescribing (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 97.5%
      confidence interval [CI] 0.67–0.99, p = 0.017) with an incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio of £1,359 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but
      there was insufficient evidence of effect on other primary endpoints (diabetes
      control OR 1.03, 97.5% CI 0.89–1.18, p = 0.693; BP control OR 1.05, 97.5% CI
      0.96–1.16, p = 0.215; anticoagulation prescribing OR 0.90, 97.5% CI 0.75–1.09, p 
      = 0.214). No statistically significant effects were observed in any secondary
      outcome except for reduced co-prescription of aspirin and clopidogrel without
      gastro-protection in patients aged 65 and over (adjusted OR 0.62; 97.5% CI
      0.39–0.99; p = 0.021). Main study limitations concern our inability to make any
      inferences about the relative effects of individual intervention components,
      given the multifaceted nature of the implementation package, and that the
      composite endpoint for diabetes control may have been too challenging to achieve.
      Conclusions: In this study, we observed that a multifaceted implementation
      package was clinically and cost-effective for targeting prescribing behaviours
      within the control of clinicians but not for more complex behaviours that also
      required patient engagement. Trial registration: The study is registered with the
      ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN91989345).

TI  - The analgesic efficacy compared ultrasound-guided continuous transverse abdominis
      plane block with epidural analgesia following abdominal surgery: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 52
AB  - Background: This review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the analgesic efficacy
      of continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block compared with epidural
      analgesia (EA) in adults after abdominal surgery. Methods: The databases PubMed, 
      Embase and Cochrane Central Register were searched from inception to June 2019
      for all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the
      analgesic efficacy of continuous TAP block compared with EA after abdominal
      surgery. The weighted mean differences (WMDs) were estimates for continuous
      variables with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous
      data. The pre-specified primary outcome was the dynamic pain scores 24 h
      postoperatively. Results: Eight trials including 453 patients (TAP block:224
      patients; EA: 229 patients) ultimately met the inclusion criteria and seven
      trials were included in the meta-analysis. Dynamic pain scores after 24 h were
      equivalent between TAP block and EA groups (WMD:0.44; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.99;
      I2 = 91%; p = 0.11). The analysis showed a significant difference between the
      subgroups according to regularly administering (4 trials; WMD:-0.11; 95% CI:
      − 0.32 to 0.09; I2 = 0%; p = 0.28) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      or not (3 trials; WMD:1.02; 95% CI: 0.09 to 1.96; I2 = 94%; p = 0.03) for
      adjuvant analgesics postoperatively. The measured time of the urinary catheter
      removal in the TAP group was significantly shorter (3 trials, WMD:-18.95, 95%
      CI:-25.22 to − 12.71; I2 = 0%; p < 0.01), as was time to first ambulation
      postoperatively (4 trials, WMD:-6.61, 95% CI: − 13.03 to − 0.19; I2 = 67%;
      p < 0.05). Conclusion: Continuous TAP block, combined with NSAIDs, can provide
      non-inferior dynamic analgesia efficacy compared with EA in postoperative pain
      management after abdominal surgery. In addition, continuous TAP block is
      associated with fewer postoperative side effects.

TI  - Identifying Acute Low Back Pain Episodes in Primary Care Practice From Clinical
      Notes: Observational Study.
LID - e16878
AB  - Background: Acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) are different conditions with
      different treatments. However, they are coded in electronic health records with
      the same International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code
      (M54.5) and can be differentiated only by retrospective chart reviews. This
      prevents an efficient definition of data-driven guidelines for billing and
      therapy recommendations, such as return-to-work options. Objective: The objective
      of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of automatically distinguishing
      acute LBP episodes by analyzing free-text clinical notes. Methods: We used a
      dataset of 17,409 clinical notes from different primary care practices; of these,
      891 documents were manually annotated as acute LBP and 2973 were generally
      associated with LBP via the recorded ICD-10 code. We compared different
      supervised and unsupervised strategies for automated identification: keyword
      search, topic modeling, logistic regression with bag of n-grams and manual
      features, and deep learning (a convolutional neural network-based architecture
      [ConvNet]). We trained the supervised models using either manual annotations or
      ICD-10 codes as positive labels. Results: ConvNet trained using manual
      annotations obtained the best results with an area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve of 0.98 and an F score of 0.70. ConvNet’s results were also 
      robust to reduction of the number of manually annotated documents. In the absence
      of manual annotations, topic models performed better than methods trained using
      ICD-10 codes, which were unsatisfactory for identifying LBP acuity. Conclusions: 
      This study uses clinical notes to delineate a potential path toward systematic
      learning of therapeutic strategies, billing guidelines, and management options
      for acute LBP at the point of care.

TI  - Optimizing Antihypertensive Medication Classification in Electronic Health
      Record-Based Data: Classification System Development and Methodological
      Comparison.
LID - e14777
AB  - Background: Computable phenotypes have the ability to utilize data within the
      electronic health record (EHR) to identify patients with certain characteristics.
      Many computable phenotypes rely on multiple types of data within the EHR
      including prescription drug information. Hypertension (HTN)-related computable
      phenotypes are particularly dependent on the correct classification of
      antihypertensive prescription drug information, as well as corresponding
      diagnoses and blood pressure information. Objective: This study aimed to create
      an antihypertensive drug classification system to be utilized with EHR-based data
      as part of HTN-related computable phenotypes. Methods: We compared 4 different
      antihypertensive drug classification systems based off of 4 different
      methodologies and terminologies, including 3 RxNorm Concept Unique Identifier
      (RxCUI)–based classifications and 1 medication name–based classification. The
      RxCUI-based classifications utilized data from (1) the Drug Ontology, (2) the new
      Medication Reference Terminology, and (3) the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
      Classification System and DrugBank, whereas the medication name–based
      classification relied on antihypertensive drug names. Each classification system 
      was applied to EHR-based prescription drug data from hypertensive patients in the
      OneFlorida Data Trust. Results: There were 13,627 unique RxCUIs and 8025 unique
      medication names from the 13,879,046 prescriptions. We observed a broad overlap
      between the 4 methods, with 84.1% (691/822) to 95.3% (695/729) of terms
      overlapping pairwise between the different classification methods. Key
      differences arose from drug products with multiple dosage forms, drug products
      with an indication of benign prostatic hyperplasia, drug products that contain
      more than 1 ingredient (combination products), and terms within the
      classification systems corresponding to retired or obsolete RxCUIs. Conclusions: 
      In total, 2 antihypertensive drug classifications were constructed, one based on 
      RxCUIs and one based on medication name, that can be used in future computable
      phenotypes that require antihypertensive drug classifications.

TI  - Myhre Syndrome Associated With Dunbar Syndrome and Urinary Tract Abnormalities: A
      Case Report.
LID - 72
AB  - Myhre syndrome is a rare condition caused by a mutation in the SMAD4 gene, which 
      leads to a defective TGF-β/BMP signaling, resulting in the proliferation of
      abnormal fibrous tissues. Clinically, patients with Myhre syndrome manifest with 
      defects of connective tissue (skin, muscles, joints), and cardiovascular and
      neurological impairment. In our report, we present a case of a 16-year-old female
      with skeletal abnormalities, reduced articular mobility, skin, and muscular
      hypertrophy and cardiovascular defects characteristic of Myhre syndrome.
      Long-term pulmonary hypertension and arterial hypertension were persistent in
      spite of antihypertensive treatment. Our patient was also diagnosed with chronic 
      kidney disease and Dunbar syndrome, which is an external compression of the
      coeliac trunk or coeliac artery by the surrounding tissues. Until now, only a few
      cases of renal complications in Myhre syndrome have been published. We describe
      for the first time a female patient with genetically confirmed Myhre syndrome
      caused by the p.Ile500Val SMAD4 mutation presenting with an unusual occurrence of
      congenital vesicoureteral reflux, proteinuria with a decreased renal function,
      and a condition recognized as Dunbar syndrome.

TI  - Hepatic Autonomic Nervous System and Neurotrophic Factors Regulate the
      Pathogenesis and Progression of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.
LID - 62
AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a continuum of excessive hepatic
      steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. It is a growing epidemic in the United
      States of America and worldwide. Progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      can lead to morbidity and mortality due to complications such as cirrhosis or
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is
      centered on increased hepatic lipogenesis and decreased hepatic lipolysis in the 
      setting of hepatic and systemic insulin resistance. Adipose tissue and hepatic
      inflammation can further perpetuate the severity of illness. Currently there are 
      no approved therapies for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Most of the drugs
      being explored for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease focus on classical
      pathogenic pathways surrounding hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation or
      fibrosis. Studies have demonstrated that the autonomic nervous system innervating
      the liver plays a crucial role in regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis,
      inflammation and fibrosis. Additionally, there is growing evidence that
      neurotrophic factors can modulate all stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease. Both the autonomic nervous system and neurotrophic factors are altered
      in patients and murine models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In this
      review we focus on the pathophysiological role of the autonomic nervous system
      and neurotrophic factors that could be potential targets for novel therapeutic
      approaches to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

TI  - Motivations for crystal methamphetamine-opioid co-injection/co-use amongst
      community-recruited people who inject drugs: a qualitative study.
LID - 14
AB  - Aims: We report on motivations for crystal methamphetamine-opioid
      co-use/co-injection through narratives of people who inject drugs during a period
      of increased crystal methamphetamine use reporting in Australia. Methods:
      Fourteen in-depth interviews were undertaken with selected participants (12 male,
      2 female) from the Melbourne Injecting Drug User Cohort Study, including those in
      and out of opioid substitution therapy (OST). Results: The main motivations for
      co-use reported by participants were as follows: (1) that heroin could be used to
      reduce the negative side effects of heavy crystal methamphetamine use,
      particularly during the ‘comedown’ phase; (2) that small quantities of crystal
      methamphetamine used with heroin could prolong the intoxication effect of heroin,
      and hence the time before opioid withdrawal; (3) that co-injection of crystal
      methamphetamine and heroin produced a more desirable intoxication effect than
      using either substance on its own and; (4) that crystal methamphetamine provided 
      a substitute ‘high’ for heroin after commencing OST treatment. Conclusions:
      Co-use of methamphetamine and opioids has been used by people who inject drugs to
      facilitate intoxication, sometimes as the result of ineffective opioid
      substitution therapy (OST) treatment and perceived lack of pleasure after
      stabilisation on OST treatment.

TI  - Genetics of ADHD: What Should the Clinician Know?
LID - 18
AB  - Purpose of Review: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) shows high
      heritability in formal genetic studies. In our review article, we provide an
      overview on common and rare genetic risk variants for ADHD and their link to
      clinical practice. Recent findings: The formal heritability of ADHD is about 80% 
      and therefore higher than most other psychiatric diseases. However, recent
      studies estimate the proportion of heritability based on singlenucleotide
      variants (SNPs) at 22%. It is a matter of debate which genetic mechanisms explain
      this huge difference. While frequent variants in first mega-analyses of
      genome-wideassociation study data containing several thousand patients give the
      first genome-wide results, explaining only little variance, the methodologically 
      more difficult analyses of rare variants are still in their infancy. Some rare
      genetic syndromes show higher prevalence for ADHD indicating a potential role for
      a small number of patients. In contrast, polygenic risk scores (PRS) could
      potentially be applied to every patient. We give an overview how PRS explain
      different behavioral phenotypes in ADHD and how they could be used for diagnosis 
      and therapy prediction. Summary: Knowledge about a patient’s genetic makeup is
      not yet mandatory for ADHD therapy or diagnosis. PRS however have been introduced
      successfully in other areas of clinical medicine, and their application in
      psychiatry will begin within the next years. In order to ensure competent advice 
      for patients, knowledge of the current state of research is useful
      forpsychiatrists.

TI  - General anesthesia technique and perception of quality of postoperative recovery 
      in women undergoing cholecystectomy: A randomized, double-blinded clinical trial.
LID - e0228805
AB  - Background: The two most common general anesthesia techniques are total
      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and venous/inhalation balanced general anesthesia
      (BGA). It is unclear whether any of these two techniques affect patient
      perception of the quality of recovery. The aim of this randomized, double-blinded
      clinical trial was to assess the quality of postoperative recovery of women
      undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. We compared
      patients who received TIVA with those who received BGA. We also evaluated the
      factors that may decrease patient-perceived quality of postoperative recovery.
      Methods: We prospectively recruited 121 women aged 18–65 years who were scheduled
      for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis. These patients
      were randomized to receive TIVA (target-controlled infusion of propofol and
      remifentanil) or BGA (continuous remifentanil infusion and sevoflurane
      inhalation). To measure the quality of postanesthetic and postoperative recovery,
      we administered the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) questionnaire 24 hours after 
      the patient awoke from anesthesia. Results: All 60 patients in the TIVA group
      responded to QoR-40 (median, 188 points; minimum 128; maximum 200). Sixty-one
      patients in the BGA group had a mean QoR-40 score of 186 points (median, 188
      points; minimum 146; maximum 200). There was no significant difference in the
      QoR-40 score between the two groups (p = 0.577). The patients who presented
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pain had worse perception of the
      quality of postoperative recovery. Conclusions: Both TIVA and BGA had a similar
      effect on the perception of the quality of postoperative recovery in women
      undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. PONV and pain may negatively
      affect patient perception of the quality of postoperative recovery.

TI  - Lornoxicam controlled release transdermal gel patch: Design, characterization and
      optimization using co-solvents as penetration enhancers.
LID - e0228908
AB  - The aim of the current study was to develop membrane-based transdermal patches of
      lornoxicam gel using oleic acid (OA)and propylene glycol (PG) as penetration
      enhancers to improve drug delivery across the skin and to evaluate in vivo
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. For this purpose, nine formulations
      were developed in accordance with 32 factorial design using Design Expert® 11.
      The concentration of propylene glycol (X1) and oleic acid (X2) were selected as
      independent variable whereas Q10 (Y1), flux (Y2) and lag time (Y3) were
      considered as the response variables. The impact of drug loading, surface area,
      gel concentration, membrane variation and agitation speed on drug release and
      permeation was also studied. The skin sensitivity reaction, analgesic activity
      and anti-inflammatory action of the optimized patch were also determined in
      Albino Wistar rats. Stability studies were performed for three months at three
      different temperature conditions. The result suggests that a membrane-based
      system with controlled zero-order drug release of 95.8 ± 1.121% for 10 h
      exhibiting flux of 126.51±1.19 μg/cm2/h and lag time of 0.908 ±0.57h was
      optimized with the desired analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect can be obtained
      by using propylene glycol and oleic acid co-solvents as a penetration enhancer.
      The patch was also found stable at 4˚C for a period of 6.44 months. Formulation
      F9 comprising of 10% PG and 3% OA was selected as an optimized formulation. The
      study demonstrates that the fabricated transdermal system of lornoxicam can
      deliver the drug through the skin in a controlled manner with desired analgesic
      and anti-inflammatory activity and can be considered as a suitable alternative of
      the oral route.

TI  - Promoting Reproducible Research for Characterizing Nonmedical Use of Medications 
      Through Data Annotation: Description of a Twitter Corpus and Guidelines.
LID - e15861
AB  - Background: Social media data are being increasingly used for population-level
      health research because it provides near real-time access to large volumes of
      consumer-generated data. Recently, a number of studies have explored the
      possibility of using social media data, such as from Twitter, for monitoring
      prescription medication abuse. However, there is a paucity of annotated data or
      guidelines for data characterization that discuss how information related to
      abuse-prone medications is presented on Twitter. Objective: This study discusses 
      the creation of an annotated corpus suitable for training supervised
      classification algorithms for the automatic classification of medication
      abuse–related chatter. The annotation strategies used for improving
      interannotator agreement (IAA), a detailed annotation guideline, and machine
      learning experiments that illustrate the utility of the annotated corpus are also
      described. Methods: We employed an iterative annotation strategy, with
      interannotator discussions held and updates made to the annotation guidelines at 
      each iteration to improve IAA for the manual annotation task. Using the grounded 
      theory approach, we first characterized tweets into fine-grained categories and
      then grouped them into 4 broad classes—abuse or misuse, personal consumption,
      mention, and unrelated. After the completion of manual annotations, we
      experimented with several machine learning algorithms to illustrate the utility
      of the corpus and generate baseline performance metrics for automatic
      classification on these data. Results: Our final annotated set consisted of
      16,443 tweets mentioning at least 20 abuse-prone medications including opioids,
      benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, central nervous system stimulants, and 
      gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs. Our final overall IAA was 0.86 (Cohen kappa),
      which represents high agreement. The manual annotation process revealed the
      variety of ways in which prescription medication misuse or abuse is discussed on 
      Twitter, including expressions indicating coingestion, nonmedical use,
      nonstandard route of intake, and consumption above the prescribed doses. Among
      machine learning classifiers, support vector machines obtained the highest
      automatic classification accuracy of 73.00% (95% CI 71.4-74.5) over the test set 
      (n=3271). Conclusions: Our manual analysis and annotations of a large number of
      tweets have revealed types of information posted on Twitter about a set of
      abuse-prone prescription medications and their distributions. In the interests of
      reproducible and community-driven research, we have made our detailed annotation 
      guidelines and the training data for the classification experiments publicly
      available, and the test data will be used in future shared tasks.

TI  - When will pulmonary function recover after rib fracture?
PG  - 108-11
AB  - Rib fracture is almost recovered with conservative management including oral
      medication. Pain is easily controlled with medication, but physiologic function
      is not readily evaluated. This study is aimed to investigate the factors
      influencing to recovery of pulmonary function test (PFT) and changes according to
      times after rib fracture. From August 2015 to January 2018, medical records of
      patients with rib fracture were reviewed retrospectively. Factors may influencing
      to recovery of PFT (age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, numbers of
      fractures, intercostal nerve block) were evaluated, and serial (initial, 1 month,
      2 months) changes of parameters PFT (forced vital capacity [FVC], forced
      expiratory volume in 1 sec [FEV1], total lung capacity [TLC], vital capacity
      [VC]) for 2 months were observed. Total patients were 60, and PFT was completed
      38 and 27 patients after 1 month and 2 months respectively. Mean age was 55.1
      years (20–84 years) and mean numbers of fracture were 3.98 (1–11). Intercostal
      nerve block and rib fixation were performed in 32 cases and 2 cases respectively.
      Age, numbers of fracture and intercostal nerve block were not significant factors
      to changes of PFT. But chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was significant
      factor to recovery of FEV1 in 1 month. PFT was improved in FVC, FEV1 through 2
      months, and improved in TLC, VC in 1 month. This study showed the evidence and
      prognosis of physiologic recovery after rib fracture. And we could tell about
      physiologic recovery to rib fracture patients with this study.

TI  - NBOMes–Highly Potent and Toxic Alternatives of LSD.
LID - 78
AB  - Recently, a new class of psychedelic compounds named NBOMe (or 25X-NBOMe) has
      appeared on the illegal drug market. NBOMes are analogs of the 2C family of
      phenethylamine drugs, originally synthesized by Alexander Shulgin, that contain a
      N-(2-methoxy)benzyl substituent. The most frequently reported drugs from this
      group are 25I-NBOMe, 25B-NBOMe, and 25C-NBOMe. NBOMe compounds are ultrapotent
      and highly efficacious agonists of serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors (Ki
      values in low nanomolar range) with more than 1000-fold selectivity for 5-HT2A
      compared with 5-HT1A. They display higher affinity for 5-HT2A receptors than
      their 2C counterparts and have markedly lower affinity, potency, and efficacy at 
      the 5-HT2B receptor compared to 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C. The drugs are sold as blotter
      papers, or in powder, liquid, or tablet form, and they are administered
      sublingually/buccally, intravenously, via nasal insufflations, or by smoking.
      Since their introduction in the early 2010s, numerous reports have been published
      on clinical intoxications and fatalities resulting from the consumption of NBOMe 
      compounds. Commonly observed adverse effects include visual and auditory
      hallucinations, confusion, anxiety, panic and fear, agitation, uncontrollable
      violent behavior, seizures, excited delirium, and sympathomimetic signs such
      mydriasis, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and diaphoresis.
      Rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypoglycemia, metabolic
      acidosis, and multiorgan failure were also reported. This survey provides an
      updated overview of the pharmacological properties, pattern of use, metabolism,
      and desired effects associated with NBOMe use. Special emphasis is given to cases
      of non-fatal and lethal intoxication involving these compounds. As the analysis
      of NBOMes in biological materials can be challenging even for laboratories
      applying modern sensitive techniques, this paper also presents the analytical
      methods most commonly used for detection and identification of NBOMes and their
      metabolites.

TI  - On the Nature of the Mother-Infant Tie and Its Interaction With Freudian Drives.
LID - 317
AB  - The affective bond between an infant and its caregiver, the so-called
      mother-infant tie, was analyzed by various reputable psychologists (e.g.,
      Ainsworth, Clark, Erikson, Anna Freud, Harlow, Klein, Spitz, and Winnicott) but
      both the basic tenets of the bond and the importance of the trauma of maternal
      deprivation for personality disorders in adults were introduced by Bowlby.
      Although Bowlby was a trained psychoanalyst, he rejected central cornerstones of 
      Freudian theory (esp. drive theory) and used concepts promulgated by renowned
      ethologists (Tinbergen and Lorenz) to establish his framework of “instinctive
      behavior” that has been developed further into the concept of “attachment theory”
      under the influence of Mary Ainsworth. However, since any precise experimental
      facts were lacking when Bowlby formulated his ideas on the concept of instinctive
      behavior, the whole framework is a descriptive, category-driven approach (like
      the ones of Freudian drives). In order to connect the mother-infant tie – as
      propounded by Bowlby – with experimental data, this manuscript undertakes a
      biochemical analysis of it because this strategy proved somewhat successful in
      relation to Freudian drives. The analysis unfolded that the neurochemical
      oxytocin, released by the action of sensory nerves, is of utmost importance for
      the operation of the mother-infant tie. Furthermore, multiple evidences have been
      presented to the fact that there is strong interaction between unconsciously
      operating Freudian drives and the consciously acting mother-infant tie (that is
      now classified as a drive). The outlined interaction in conjunction with the
      classification of attachment urges as drives gave a very detailed insight into
      how a SEEKING-derived reward can be evoked during operation of the mother-infant 
      tie. In summary, there is no need to marginalize either the mother-infant tie or 
      Freudian drives but rather there is need to respect both (principally different) 
      impulses in moving toward a more extensive description.

TI  - Ultrasound-Guided Stellate Ganglion Block for Central Post-Stroke Pain: A Case
      Report and Review.
PG  - 461-4
AB  - Background: Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is refractory to pharmacotherapy (eg,
      NSAIDs, opioids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants), and may require
      transcranial or deep brain stimulation. Case Presentation: A 67-year-old woman
      presented with severe paroxysmal cramp-like pain on the right side, including the
      head and both upper and lower extremities. The pain started 5 years earlier, was 
      initially mild and occasional, but gradually intensified to an unbearable degree 
      with an average of 10–15 daily episodes, each lasting for 5–10 mins. The patient 
      disclosed “hemorrhagic stroke” 10 years ago that resulted in hemiplegia on the
      right side. CT examination verified the lesion. The patient received daily
      injection of 2-mL 2% lidocaine under ultrasound guidance to block the stellate
      ganglion. Pain subsided rapidly in both intensity and frequency. On the seventh
      day, the patient no longer had pain episodes. At the last follow-up, 9 months
      later, the patient was free from pain. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided stellate
      ganglion block is a viable alternative for CPSP that is refractory to
      pharmacotherapy.

TI  - In inpatients with cirrhosis opioid use is common and associated with length of
      stay and persistent use post-discharge.
LID - e0229497
AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that opioids are often prescribed 
      and associated with complications in outpatients with cirrhosis. Less is known
      about opioids among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. We aimed to describe
      the patterns and complications of opioid use among inpatients with cirrhosis.
      Methods: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with cirrhosis
      admitted to a single hospital system from 4/4/2014 to 9/30/2015. We excluded
      hospitalizations with a surgery, invasive procedure, or palliative care/hospice
      consult in order to understand opioid use that may be avoidable. We determined
      the frequency, dosage, and type of opioids given during hospitalization. Using
      bivariable and multivariable analyses, we assessed length of stay, intensive care
      unit transfer, and in-hospital mortality by opioid use. Results: Of 217
      inpatients with cirrhosis, 118 (54.4%) received opioids during hospitalization,
      including 41.7% of patients without prior outpatient opioid prescriptions.
      Benzodiazepines or hypnotic sleep aids were given to 28.8% of opioid recipients. 
      In the multivariable model, younger age and outpatient opioid prescription were
      associated with inpatient opioids. Hospitalization was longer among opioid
      recipients (median 3.9 vs 3.0 days, p = 0.002) and this difference remained after
      adjusting for age, cirrhosis severity, and medical comorbidities. There was no
      difference in intensive care unit transfers and no deaths occurred. At discharge,
      22 patients were newly started on opioids of whom 10 (45.5%) had opioid
      prescriptions at 90 days post-discharge. Conclusion: In non-surgical inpatients
      with cirrhosis, opioid prescribing was common and associated with prolonged
      length of stay. A high proportion of patients newly discharged with opioid
      prescriptions had ongoing prescriptions at 90 days post-discharge.

TI  - A215 PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE ARE FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED OPIOID
      ANALGESICS WHEN DISCHARGED FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.
PG  - 88-9
AB  - Background: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer a substantial
      burden of morbidity related to chronic abdominal pain and are susceptible to
      opioid dependence and abuse that is associated with increased rates of
      depression, hospitalization, and mortality. While opioid prescription and renewal
      by a single provider minimizes the long-term risk of misuse, many patients with
      IBD will seek out care in the emergency department (ED) where short-term, ‘to-go’
      use of narcotic analgesia is associated with potential treatment-related
      complications. Aims: To assess rates of opioid prescription in IBD patients
      presenting to the ED and to assess factors associated with opioid use. Methods:
      This is a retrospective analysis of cross-sectional data collected in the United 
      States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2006–2015. 
      We compared a study population of adult IBD patients (International
      Classification of Diseases ICD-9 555.X, 556.X) ≥18 years discharged from the ED
      to a control group of patients presenting with non-specific abdominal pain (ICD-9
      789.0, 564.1, 536.8). The proportion of patients given opioids in ED and at ED
      discharge were calculated with relative standard error (RSE), and national level 
      estimates were produced using survey weights. Univariable and multivariable
      logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of opioid prescription at
      discharge, expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
      Results: A total of 767,577 IBD patients were compared to 71,359,257 patients
      with non-specific abdominal pain. A total of 37.3% (RSE 4.7%) of IBD patients
      compared to 24.7% (RSE 0.8%) of controls (p<0.01) received an opioid prescription
      on ED discharge. 49.1% (RSE 5.6%) of IBD patients compared to 37.2% (RSE 0.8%) of
      patients with non-specific abdominal pain (p=0.02) received an opioid while in
      ED. Significant predictors of narcotic prescription at discharge in multivariable
      analysis included: age <50 (OR 6.83 [95% CI: 1.21, 38.48], p=0.03), non-white
      race (OR 4.73 [95% CI: 1.46, 15.39], p=0.01), and narcotic use in the ED (OR 5.27
      [95% CI: 1.96, 14.21], p<0.01). Conclusions: Nearly 40% of IBD patients were
      prescribed an opioid at discharge from the ED. This rate is significantly higher 
      than for patients who present with non-specific abdominal pain and younger,
      non-white IBD patients were disproportionately more likely to receive an opioid
      prescription. Given the risks associated with on-demand narcotic use in IBD
      patients, our data highlight a potential gap in care for accessing comprehensive 
      pain management solutions.Table 1.Survey weighted baseline demographic

TI  - A127 THE ROLE OF ENDOGENOUS OPIOIDS IN MITIGATING OPIOID TOLERANCE IN A
      PRE-CLINICAL MODEL OF IBD.
PG  - 147-8
AB  - Background: While opioid drugs are used to treat pain in IBD patients, escalating
      doses can induce tolerance and paradoxical increased pain signaling. Endogenous
      opioids are released by immune cells during chronic colitis and have an analgesic
      action but it is unknown whether they can mitigate the development of tolerance
      to opioid drugs in IBD. Aims: To evaluate whether endogenous opioids released
      during chronic inflammation prevent the development of tolerance and/or increased
      pain signaling following chronic morphine treatment. Methods: Three groups of
      C57BL/6 mice were studied: 1) control, 2) chronic colitis induced with 3 cycles
      of 2% DSS (cDSS mice) and 3) chronic DSS mice injected with escalating doses of
      morphine on the last 7 days of DSS (10, 20, 30 mg/kg for the first 3 days, then
      40mg/kg on 4 to 7 day) (cDSS-morphine mice). Ex vivo afferent nerve recordings
      were obtained from flat-sheet distal colon preparations (day 31) to determine
      their mechanosensitivity by probing with a 1g von Frey hair before and after
      acute morphine (1μM, 10 min perfusion). In parallel experiments, supernatants
      were obtained from the proximal colon and incubated overnight with isolated
      dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons from control mice. Neuronal excitability was
      then examined by measuring the rheobase using perforated patch clamp. Results: In
      afferent nerve recordings, acute application of 1μM morphine inhibited the
      colonic afferent response to probing in control mice (17.86 vs 12.31 Hz; p<0.05),
      whereas no effect of morphine was seen in cDSS mice. In cDSS-morphine mice acute 
      morphine perfusion paradoxically increased the mean afferent response to probing 
      (13.99 vs 17.28 Hz, p<0.05). Single units were analyzed to identify how many
      mechanosensitive responses were increased, decreased or not affected by acute
      morphine perfusion. Compared to control mice, cDSS mice exhibited increased
      numbers of unaffected units (6/18 vs 1/14) whereas cDSS-morphine mice had
      decreased number of inhibited units (1/17 vs 11/14) and increased number of
      excited units (8/17 vs. 2/14) (Figure 1). In patch clamp recordings, colonic
      supernatants from cDSS mice reduced the excitability of DRG neurons (rheobase
      increased 28%; p<0.05), however, this effect was lost in neurons incubated with
      cDSS-morphine supernatants. Conclusions: Endogenous opioids released during cDSS 
      colitis do not mitigate tolerance to chronic morphine exposure and may diminish
      the response to acute morphine. Moreover, the paradoxical hyperexcitable response
      to acute morphine induced by chronic morphine was not blocked by endogenous
      opioids. Our patch clamp data suggest that endogenous opioid actions are lost
      following chronic morphine exposure and could result from inhibition of their
      release from immune cells. Funding Agencies: CCC

TI  - A54 DELTA OPIOID RECEPTOR SIGNALING MEDIATES OPIOID INDUCED TOLERANCE AND
      HYPERALGESIA IN COLONIC SENSORY NERVES.
PG  - 63-4
AB  - Background: While opioid drugs are widely used for treating abdominal pain,
      prolonged exposure to opioids can induce tolerance and paradoxically increase
      pain. We previously showed in colonic afferent nerves that chronic morphine
      treatment causes tolerance and paradoxical hyperalgesia, however the mechanisms
      are unknown. Aims: To evaluate the role of delta opioid receptor (DOR) signaling 
      in opioid induced tolerance and hyperalgesia in colonic nerves during chronic
      morphine exposure. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were injected (i.p.) twice daily for 7
      days with escalating doses of morphine (10, 20, 30 mg/kg for the first 3 days,
      then 40mg/kg on 4th to 7th day); a subset of mice were also injected with 2.5
      mg/kg naltrindole (NTI), a DOR antagonist. The analgesic response in vivo was
      monitored daily using the tail-flick test. To assess the effect of chronic
      morphine exposure, mice were euthanized on day 8, and the dorsal root ganglia
      (DRGs) and colons were harvested. Isolated DRG neurons were incubated with 1μM
      morphine (30 min) and neuronal excitability was determined by measuring the
      rheobase (amount of current required to elicit an action potential) using
      perforated patch clamp. To assess changes in colonic afferent nerve excitability,
      ex vivo afferent nerve recordings were obtained from flat-sheet colon
      preparations to determine the effects of 1μM morphine (10 min perfusion) on
      mechanosensitivity by probing with 1g von Frey hair. Results: The tail flick test
      showed that the DOR antagonist NTI inhibited (30%) the maximal antinociceptive
      effect of morphine and reduced morphine tolerance. In patch clamp recordings, 1μM
      morphine paradoxically increased the excitability of small DRG neurons from
      morphine mice (rheobase decreased 28%; p<0.05, 2-way ANOVA), whereas this
      excitatory effect was absent on neurons from NTI+morphine mice. Acute application
      of 1μM morphine had no effect on afferent nerve responses to probing in morphine 
      mice (14.9 vs 16.7 Hz; p=ns, paired t test, n=15) whereas it inhibited the
      afferent nerve response to probing in NTI+morphine mice (15.2 vs 9.9 Hz; p<0.001,
      paired t test, n=16). Furthermore, most single units from morphine mice had an
      increased response to probing following acute morphine application (7/15 vs 2/16 
      units excited), whereas most units form NTI-morphine mice were inhibited (14/16
      vs. 3/15 units inhibited, P<0.001, Chi-square). Conclusions: These findings
      suggest that DOR signaling plays a significant role in the development of opioid 
      tolerance and hyperalgesia in colonic afferent nerves induced by chronic morphine
      treatment. Thus, antagonists of DOR may help to mitigate these side effects
      induced by opioids. Funding Agencies: CCC

TI  - A213 A NOVEL PH-SENSITIVE OPIOID ANALGESIC THAT IS SELECTIVELY ACTIVATED IN
      ACIDIC INFLAMMATORY ENVIRONMENTS.
PG  - 85-7
AB  - Background: Opioids drugs are effective analgesics for inflammatory disorders
      such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but their effects at non-inflammed sites
      can cause serious morbidity and even death. Exploiting the knowledge that tissue 
      pH in inflamed tissues is acidic (e.g. 6.5–7.0), a novel opioid analgesic,
      ±)-N-(3-fluoro-1-phenethylpiperidine-4-yl)-N-phenylpropionamide (NFEPP), with a
      low acid dissociation constant, was developed that selectively activates
      peripheral µ-opioid receptor (MOPr) at acidic pH. Thus, pH-sensitive binding of
      NFEPP could selectively inhibit nociceptive nerves in the inflamed colon and have
      no effect on non-inflamed tissues outside the GI tract. Aims: Evaluate whether
      NFEPP causes inhibition of colonic nociceptors at acidic pH’s, which mimic the
      inflamed colon. Methods: To evaluate pH sensitive property of NFEPP to activate
      MOPr, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons from C57BL/6 mice were exposed to the
      MOPr agonists NFEPP (300nM, 15 min) or DAMGO (100nM, 15 min) or vehicle at pH 6.5
      or 6.8 or 7.4. Neuronal excitability was measured by recording the rheobase
      (minimum current to fire an action potential) using patch clamp recordings of
      isolated dorsal root ganglia neurons. In parallel ex vivo studies of mouse colon,
      extracellular recordings were obtained from afferent nerves innervating the
      distal colon. Afferent responses to probing with von Frey hair (1 gm) were
      examined before and after exposure to NFEPP (300nM, 5 min superfusion) at pH 6.5 
      and 7.4 respectively. Oneway ANOVA and post hoc Dunnett and Bonferroni tests were
      used to analyze the data. Results: In patch clamp studies, NFEPP caused a
      decrease in DRG excitability at pH 6.5 and 6.8 (increased rheobase 21.3%, p<0.05 
      and 28.9%, p<0.05 respectively compared to vehicle) but had no effect at
      physiological pH 7.4. DAMGO, a MOPr agonist, caused inhibition of nociceptor
      excitability at pH 7.4 (increased rheobase 25.2%, p<0.05 compared to vehicle) as 
      shown in previous experiments, but had no effect at pH 6.5 and 6.8. Vehicle had
      no effect at the different pH’s. In colonic afferent nerve recordings, NFEPP
      significantly attenuated afferent response (28.9% P<0.01) to probing at pH 6.5
      and this effect was reversed after a 15 min washout. At pH 7.4 NFEPP had no
      effect on afferent nerve firing. Conclusions: NFEPP activated MOPr at acidic pH
      causing inhibition of colonic nociceptors. This pH-selective agonist provides a
      new strategy to relieve pain at the site of inflammation while being devoid of
      any of unwanted activity in non-inflamed organs. Funding Agencies: CCC

TI  - A124 SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION OF CANNABINOIDS AND OPIOIDS REDUCES PAIN SIGNALING
      IN COLONIC NOCICEPTIVE NERVES.
PG  - 144-5
AB  - Background: With the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada,
      increasing numbers of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are using
      cannabis to treat their pain, either alone or together with opioids. However,
      little is known about potential benefits of cannabinoids for treating visceral
      pain originating within the GI tract and whether the combined use of cannabinoids
      and opioids could enable the reduction or even discontinuation of opioids. Aims: 
      To investigate the effects of cannabinoids alone or in combination with opioids
      on colonic nociceptive nerves. Methods: Extracellular afferent nerve recordings
      were obtained from ex vivo flat sheet preparations of male C57BL/6 mouse distal
      colons. Single unit analysis discriminated individual afferent neuron responses
      to mechanical probing of the colon with a 1g von Frey hair before and after
      superfusion of HU-210, a selective CB1 receptor agonist, HU-308, a selective CB2 
      receptor agonist, DAMGO, a selective mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, or a
      combination. In parallel studies, perforated patch clamp techniques were employed
      to assess the rheobase as a measure of neuronal excitability in acutely
      dissociated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons in the presence of one or more of
      these agonists. Data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple
      comparisons test. Results: Superfusion of HU-210 (1 μM), caused significant
      inhibition in afferent nerve mechanosensitivity compared to control (6.2±1.1 vs. 
      13.7±2.5 Hz, p=0.005, n=10); lower concentrations (10 nM and 100 nM) had no
      effect (p>0.99, n=11; p=0.600, n=10 respectively). Conversely, the CB2 agonist
      HU-308 (1 μM and 10 μM), did not alter mechanosensitivity (p>0.9, n=8 for both
      concentrations). Superfusion of HU-210 alone (100 nM) or DAMGO (1 nM) alone in
      the same recording had no effect, but when both agonists were superfused
      together, there was a significant reduction in mechanosensitivity (8.1±1.7 vs.
      14.8±2.3 Hz, p<0.01, n=10). In patch clamp recordings of DRG neurons, HU-210 (1
      μM) decreased excitability (i.e. increased rheobase, 94.4±9.4 vs. 62.7±6.4 pA;
      p=0.031, n=9), whereas a lower concentration (100 nM) had no effect. Similar to
      afferent nerve recordings, when applied alone, DAMGO (1 nM) and HU-210 (100 nM)
      did not affect rheobase (DAMGO: p>0.99, n=9; HU-210: p>0.99, n=10), whereas the
      combination of both agonists significantly decreased excitability (123.0±13.4 vs.
      62.7±6.4 pA, p<0.01, n=10). Conclusions: Activation of CB1 receptors inhibits
      mechanosensitivity of colonic afferent nerves while a CB2 agonist had no effect. 
      Interestingly, combination of sub-threshold concentrations of CB1 and MOR
      agonists inhibited colonic afferent nerves and thus, may suggest that
      cannabinoids could enable opioid dose reduction or discontinuation. Funding

TI  - Mapping the Steroid Response to Major Trauma From Injury to Recovery: A
      Prospective Cohort Study.
LID - dgz302
AB  - Context: Survival rates after severe injury are improving, but complication rates
      and outcomes are variable. Objective: This cohort study addressed the lack of
      longitudinal data on the steroid response to major trauma and during recovery.
      Design: We undertook a prospective, observational cohort study from time of
      injury to 6 months postinjury at a major UK trauma centre and a military
      rehabilitation unit, studying patients within 24 hours of major trauma (estimated
      New Injury Severity Score (NISS) > 15). Main outcome measures: We measured
      adrenal and gonadal steroids in serum and 24-hour urine by mass spectrometry,
      assessed muscle loss by ultrasound and nitrogen excretion, and recorded clinical 
      outcomes (ventilator days, length of hospital stay, opioid use, incidence of
      organ dysfunction, and sepsis); results were analyzed by generalized mixed-effect
      linear models. Findings: We screened 996 multiple injured adults, approached 106,
      and recruited 95 eligible patients; 87 survived. We analyzed all male survivors
      <50 years not treated with steroids (N = 60; median age 27 [interquartile range
      24–31] years; median NISS 34 [29–44]). Urinary nitrogen excretion and muscle loss
      peaked after 1 and 6 weeks, respectively. Serum testosterone,
      dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate decreased immediately 
      after trauma and took 2, 4, and more than 6 months, respectively, to recover;
      opioid treatment delayed dehydroepiandrosterone recovery in a dose-dependent
      fashion. Androgens and precursors correlated with SOFA score and probability of
      sepsis. Conclusion: The catabolic response to severe injury was accompanied by
      acute and sustained androgen suppression. Whether androgen supplementation
      improves health outcomes after major trauma requires further investigation.

TI  - Effects of combined warmed preoperative forced-air and warmed perioperative
      intravenous fluids on maternal temperature during cesarean section: a
      prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
LID - 48
AB  - Background: Preventing the frequent perioperative hypothermia incidents that
      occur during elective caesarean deliveries would be beneficial. This trial aimed 
      at evaluating the effect of preoperative forced-air warming alongside
      perioperative intravenous fluid warming in women undergoing cesarean sections
      under spinal anesthesia. Methods: We randomly allocated 135 women undergoing
      elective cesarean deliveries to either the intervention group (preoperative
      forced-air and intravenous fluid warming, n = 69) or the control group (no active
      warming, n = 66). The primary outcome measure was the core temperature change
      between groups from baseline to the end of the surgical procedure. Secondary
      outcomes included thermal comfort scores, the incidences of shivering and
      hypothermia (< 36 °C), the core temperature on arrival at the post-anesthesia
      care unit, neonatal axillary temperature at birth, and Apgar scores. Results:
      Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significantly different core temperature
      changes (from the pre-spinal temperature to that at the end of the procedure)
      between groups (F = 13.022, P < 0.001). The thermal comfort scores were also
      higher in the intervention group than in the control group (F = 9.847,
      P = 0.002). The overall incidence of perioperative hypothermia was significantly 
      lower in the intervention group than in the control group (20.6% vs. 51.6%,
      P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Warming preoperative forced-air and perioperative
      intravenous fluids may prevent maternal hypothermia, reduce maternal shivering,
      and improve maternal thermal comfort for patients undergoing cesarean sections
      under spinal anesthesia. Trial registration: The study was registered with the
      Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR1800019117) on
      October26, 2018.

TI  - Electroacupuncture Inhibits the Activity of Astrocytes in Spinal Cord in Rats
      with Visceral Hypersensitivity by Inhibiting P2Y1 Receptor-Mediated MAPK/ERK
      Signaling Pathway.
LID - 4956179
AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic functional bowel disease 
      characterized by abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits in the absence of
      organic disease. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to alleviate visceral
      hypersensitivity (VH) in IBS rat models by inhibiting the activation of
      astrocytes in the spinal cord. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms
      mediated by P2Y1 receptor of this effect of electroacupuncture remain unclear.
      Aim: To explore whether EA inhibits the activity of astrocytes in the spinal cord
      dorsal horn of rat with visceral hypersensitivity by inhibiting P2Y1 receptor and
      its downstream mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase 1 
      (MAPK/ERK) pathway. Methods: Ten-day-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were given
      an intracolonic injection of 0.2 ml of 0.5% acetic acid (AA) to establish a
      visceral hypersensitivity model. EA was performed at Zusanli (ST 36) and
      Shangjuxu (ST 37) at 100 Hz for 1.05 s and 2 Hz for 2.85 s alternately, pulse
      width for 0.1 ms, 1 mA, 30 min/d, once a day, for 1 week. Cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, 
      and TNF-α were analyzed by ELISA. The expressions of the P2Y1 receptor and
      pERK1/2 were analyzed by Western Blot and real-time PCR in the model and EA
      treated animals to explore the molecular mechanism of EA in inhibiting the
      activity of spinal cord dorsal horn (L6-S2 segment) astrocytes in rats with IBS
      visceral hypersensitivity. Results: EA significantly reduced the behavioral
      abdominal withdrawal reflex score (AWRs) of IBS rats with visceral
      hypersensitivity induced by AA. For comparison, intrathecal injection of
      astrocytes activity inhibitor fluorocitrate (FCA) also reduced visceral
      hypersensitivity in IBS rats. EA at Zusanli and Shangjuxu inhibited the mRNA and 
      protein expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and in rat
      spinal cord and reduced the release of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1, and
      TNF-α were analyzed by ELISA. The expressions of the P2Y1 receptor and pERK1/2
      were analyzed by Western Blot and real-time PCR in the model and EA treated
      animals to explore the molecular mechanism of EA in inhibiting the activity of
      spinal cord dorsal horn (L6-S2 segment) astrocytes in rats with IBS visceral
      hypersensitivity. β, and TNF-μg, 10 μg, 10  Conclusion: EA inhibited astrocyte
      activity in the spinal cord dorsal horn of rat with IBS visceral hypersensitivity
      by inhibiting the P2Y1 receptor and its downstream, PKC, and MAPK/ERK1/2
      pathways.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine Pharmacokinetics in Neonates with Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy
      Receiving Hypothermia.
LID - 2582965
AB  - Dexmedetomidine is a promising sedative and analgesic for newborns with
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH).
      Pharmacokinetics and safety of dexmedetomidine were evaluated in a phase I,
      single-center, open-label study to inform future trial strategies. We recruited 7
      neonates ≥36 weeks' gestational age diagnosed with moderate-to-severe HIE, who
      received a continuous dexmedetomidine infusion during TH and the 6 h rewarming
      period. Time course of plasma dexmedetomidine concentration was characterized by 
      serial blood sampling during and after the 64.8 ± 6.9 hours of infusion.
      Noncompartmental analysis yielded descriptive pharmacokinetic estimates: plasma
      clearance of 0.760 ± 0.155 L/h/kg, steady-state distribution volume of
      5.22 ± 2.62 L/kg, and mean residence time of 6.84 ± 3.20 h. Naive pooled and
      population analyses according to a one-compartment model provided similar
      estimates of clearance and distribution volume. Overall, clearance was either
      comparable or lower, distribution volume was larger, and mean residence time or
      elimination half-life was longer in cooled newborns with HIE compared to
      corresponding estimates previously reported for uncooled (normothermic) newborns 
      without HIE at comparable gestational and postmenstrual ages. As a result, plasma
      concentrations in cooled newborns with HIE rose more slowly in the initial hours 
      of infusion compared to predicted concentration-time profiles based on reported
      pharmacokinetic parameters in normothermic newborns without HIE, while similar
      steady-state levels were achieved. No acute adverse events were associated with
      dexmedetomidine treatment. While dexmedetomidine appeared safe for neonates with 
      HIE during TH at infusion doses up to 0.4 μg/kg/h, a loading dose strategy may be
      needed to overcome the initial lag in rise of plasma dexmedetomidine
      concentration.

      Post-Thoracotomy Pain. A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind, Sham-Controlled, 
      Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trial.
LID - 125
AB  - Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used for various
      chronic pain conditions, but experience with tDCS for acute postoperative pain is
      limited. This study investigated the effect of tDCS vs. sham stimulation on
      postoperative morphine consumption and pain intensity after thoracotomy. Methods:
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled
      trial in lung cancer patients undergoing thoracotomy under general anesthesia.
      All patients received patient-controlled (PCA) intravenous morphine and
      intercostal nerve blocks at the end of surgery. The intervention group (a-tDCS, n
      = 31) received anodal tDCS over the left primary motor cortex (C3-Fp2) for 20 min
      at 1.2 mA, on five consecutive days; the control group (n = 31) received sham
      stimulation. Morphine consumption, number of analgesia demands, and pain
      intensity at rest, with movement and with cough were recorded at the following
      intervals: immediately before (T1), immediately after intervention (T2), then
      every hour for 4 h (Т3–Т6), then every 6 h (Т7–Т31) for 5 days. We recorded
      outcomes on postoperative days 1 and 5 and conducted a phone interview inquiring 
      about chronic pain 1 year later (NCT03005548). Results: A total of 62 patients
      enrolled, but tDCS was prematurely stopped in six patients. Fifty-five patients
      (27 a-tDCS, 28 sham) had three or more tDCS applications and were included in the
      analysis. Cumulative morphine dose in the first 120 h after surgery was
      significantly lower in the tDCS [77.00 (54.00–123.00) mg] compared to sham group 
      [112.00 (79.97–173.35) mg, p = 0.043, Cohen’s d = 0.42]. On postoperative day 5, 
      maximum visual analog scale (VAS) pain score with cough was significantly lower
      in the tDCS group [29.00 (20.00–39.00) vs. 44.50 (30.00–61.75) mm, p = 0.018],
      and pain interference with cough was 80% lower [10.00 (0.00–30.00) vs. 50.00
      (0.00–70.00), p = 0.013]. One year after surgery, there was no significant
      difference between groups with regard to chronic pain and analgesic use.
      Conclusion: In lung cancer patients undergoing thoracotomy, three to five tDCS
      sessions significantly reduced cumulative postoperative morphine use, maximum VAS
      pain scores with cough, and pain interference with cough on postoperative day 5, 
      but there was no obvious long-term benefit from tDCS.

TI  - Identification and Management of Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity After
      Traumatic Brain Injury.
LID - 81
AB  - Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) has predominantly been described after
      traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is associated with hyperthermia,
      hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, dystonia (hypertonia or
      spasticity), and even motor features such as extensor/flexion posturing. Despite 
      the pathophysiology of PSH not being completely understood, most researchers
      gradually agree that PSH is driven by the loss of the inhibition of excitation in
      the sympathetic nervous system without parasympathetic involvement. Recently,
      advances in the clinical and diagnostic features of PSH in TBI patients have
      reached a broad clinical consensus in many neurology departments. These advances 
      should provide a more unanimous foundation for the systematic research on this
      clinical syndrome and its clear management. Clinically, a great deal of attention
      has been paid to the definition and diagnostic criteria, epidemiology and
      pathophysiology, symptomatic treatment, and prevention and control of secondary
      brain injury of PSH in TBI patients. Potential benefits of treatment for PSH may 
      result from the three main goals: eliminating predisposing causes, mitigating
      excessive sympathetic outflow, and supportive therapy. However, individual
      pathophysiological differences, therapeutic responses and outcomes, and precision
      medicine approaches to PSH management are varied and inconsistent between
      studies. Further, many potential therapeutic drugs might suppress manifestations 
      of PSH in the process of TBI treatment. The purpose of this review is to present 
      current and comprehensive studies of the identification of PSH after TBI in the
      early stage and provide a framework for symptomatic management of TBI patients
      with PSH.

TI  - Exploring the Use of Meditation as a Valuable Tool to Counteract Sedentariness.
LID - 299
AB  - Some forms of meditation have been recently proposed as effective tools to
      facilitate the handling of undesired thoughts and reappraisal of negative
      emotions that commonly arise during exercise-related situations. The effects of
      meditation-based interventions on psychological responses could also be used as a
      means by which to increase exercise adherence and counteract the detrimental
      consequences of sedentariness. In the present article, we briefly describe the
      effects of meditation on physical activity and related factors. We also propose a
      theoretical model as a means by which to further understanding of the effects of 
      meditation on psychological, psychophysical, and psychophysiological responses
      during exercise. The results of very recent studies in the realms of cognitive
      and affective psychology are promising. The putative psychological mechanisms
      underlying the effects of meditation on exercise appear to be associated with the
      interpretation of interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory signals. This is
      primarily due to the fact that meditation influences the cerebral processing of
      physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts. In such instances, the bodily and
      perceptual responses that are commonly reported during exercise might be assuaged
      during the practice of meditation. It also appears that conscious presence and
      self-compassion function as an emotional backdrop against which more complex
      behaviors can be forged. In such instances, re-engagement to physical activity
      programs can be more effectively achieved through the implementation of holistic 
      methods to treat the body and mind. The comments provided in the present paper
      might have very important implications for exercise adherence and the treatment
      of hypokinetic diseases.

TI  - Adaptation for Regulatory Application: A Content Analysis of FDA Risk Evaluation 
      and Mitigation Strategies Assessment Plans (2014–2018) Using RE-AIM.
LID - 43
AB  - Background: Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) are safety programs 
      that U.S. Food and Drug Administration can require to ensure a drug's benefits
      outweigh its risks and can be considered public health interventions. FDA's 2019 
      draft Guidance for Industry on REMS Assessments encourages the development of
      “novel methods for assessing REMS [to] help advance the science of post-market
      assessment of effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies.”Objective: To
      characterize REMS assessment plans using RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, 
      Implementation, Maintenance) framework and identify areas for advancing methods
      for evaluating REMS programs. RE-AIM was selected for its wide application
      evaluating the translation of scientific advances into practice for public health
      impact.Methods: A content analysis of REMS assessment plans (N = 18) and
      measures(n = 540) was conducted for REMS programs approved by FDA between
      1/1/2014–12/31/2018. Eligibility criteria were: a new drug application or
      biologic license application, included FDA-mandated mitigation strategies called 
      elements to assure safe use (ETASU), and represented a single product REMS
      program. Assessment plans were collected from publicly available regulatory
      approval letters from REMS@FDA website. Blinded reviewers categorized each REMS
      assessment measure to a RE-AIM dimension, adjudicated their application (average 
      IRR 75%), and refined the adapted dimensions' definitions. Dimensions were also
      mapped to REMS Assessment guidance categories.Results: The median number of
      assessment measures per REMS assessment plan was 31 (IQR: 21–36). Frequency of
      measures per RE-AIM criteria per REMS program was: Reach (median = 2; IQR: 2–4); 
      Effectiveness (median = 2.5; IQR:1–4); Adoption (median = 3.5; IQR: 2–5);
      Implementation (median = 18; IQR: 15–24); Maintenance (median = 0; IQR: 0–1).
      Adoption (among prescriber, health system agents of implementation) was more
      commonly assessed than Reach (population-attributable number of patients
      affected). Assessment of heterogeneity of Adoption and Reach was generally
      absent. Implementation assessment measures were most common among drugs requiring
      evidence of safe-use conditions before dispensing or administering the drug.
      Patient-level Effectiveness and Maintenance assessments were most common among
      drugs requiring patient monitoring.Discussion: Implementation science frameworks,
      such as RE-AIM, can be applied to characterize REMS assessment measures and
      identify opportunities for standardizing and strengthening their evaluation.
      Methods to measure Maintenance are needed to provide real-world evidence of REMS 
      integration into the healthcare system.

TI  - HIV-1 Tat: Role in Bystander Toxicity.
LID - 61
AB  - HIV Tat protein is a critical protein that plays multiple roles in HIV
      pathogenesis. While its role as the transactivator of HIV transcription is
      well-established, other non-viral replication-associated functions have been
      described in several HIV-comorbidities even in the current antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) era. HIV Tat protein is produced and released into the extracellular space 
      from cells with active HIV replication or from latently HIV-infected cells into
      neighboring uninfected cells even in the absence of active HIV replication and
      viral production due to effective ART. Neighboring uninfected and HIV-infected
      cells can take up the released Tat resulting in the upregulation of inflammatory 
      genes and activation of pathways that leads to cytotoxicity observed in several
      comorbidities such as HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), HIV
      associated cardiovascular impairment, and accelerated aging. Thus, understanding 
      how Tat modulates host and viral response is important in designing novel
      therapeutic approaches to target the chronic inflammatory effects of soluble
      viral proteins in HIV infection.

TI  - Cationic Arginine-Rich Peptides (CARPs): A Novel Class of Neuroprotective Agents 
      With a Multimodal Mechanism of Action.
LID - 108
AB  - There are virtually no clinically available neuroprotective drugs for the
      treatment of acute and chronic neurological disorders, hence there is an urgent
      need for the development of new neuroprotective molecules. Cationic arginine-rich
      peptides (CARPs) are an expanding and relatively novel class of compounds, which 
      possess intrinsic neuroprotective properties. Intriguingly, CARPs possess a
      combination of biological properties unprecedented for a neuroprotective agent
      including the ability to traverse cell membranes and enter the CNS, antagonize
      calcium influx, target mitochondria, stabilize proteins, inhibit proteolytic
      enzymes, induce pro-survival signaling, scavenge toxic molecules, and reduce
      oxidative stress as well as, having a range of anti-inflammatory, analgesic,
      anti-microbial, and anti-cancer actions. CARPs have also been used as carrier
      molecules for the delivery of other putative neuroprotective agents across the
      blood-brain barrier and blood-spinal cord barrier. However, there is increasing
      evidence that the neuroprotective efficacy of many, if not all these other agents
      delivered using a cationic arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (CCPPs) carrier
      (e.g., TAT) may actually be mediated largely by the properties of the carrier
      molecule, with overall efficacy further enhanced according to the amino acid
      composition of the cargo peptide, in particular its arginine content. Therefore, 
      in reviewing the neuroprotective mechanisms of action of CARPs we also consider
      studies using CCPPs fused to a putative neuroprotective peptide. We review the
      history of CARPs in neuroprotection and discuss in detail the intrinsic
      biological properties that may contribute to their cytoprotective effects and
      their usefulness as a broad-acting class of neuroprotective drugs.

TI  - Peripheral Opioid Receptor Antagonists for Opioid-Induced Constipation: A Primer 
      on Pharmacokinetic Variabilities with a Focus on Drug Interactions.
PG  - 447-56
AB  - Opioid analgesics remain a treatment option for refractory acute and chronic
      pain, despite their potential risk for abuse and adverse events (AEs). Opioids
      are associated with several common AEs, but the most bothersome is opioid-induced
      constipation (OIC). OIC is often overlooked but has the potential to affect
      patient quality of life, increase associated symptom burden, and impede long-term
      opioid compliance. The peripherally acting µ-receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) are a
      class of drugs that include methylnaltrexone, naloxegol, and naldemedine.
      Collectively, each is approved for the treatment of OIC. PAMORAs work
      peripherally in the gastrointestinal tract, without impacting the central
      analgesic effects of opioids. However, each has unique pharmacokinetic properties
      that may be impacted by coadministered drugs or food. This review focuses on
      important metabolic and pharmacokinetic principals that are pertinent to drug
      interactions involving µ-opioid receptor antagonists prescribed for OIC. It
      highlights subtle differences among the PAMORAs that may have clinical
      significance. For example, unlike naloxegol or naldemedine, methylnaltrexone is
      not a substrate for CYP3A4 or p-glycoprotein; therefore, its plasma concentration
      is not altered when coadministered with concomitant medications that are CYP3A4
      or p-glycoprotein inducers or inhibitors. With a better understanding of
      pharmacokinetic nuances of each PAMORA, clinicians will be better equipped to
      identify potential safety and efficacy considerations that may arise when PAMORAs
      are coadministered with other medications.

TI  - Music Use for Sedation in Critically ill Children (MUSiCC trial): study protocol 
      for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
LID - 31
AB  - Background: Stress induced by pain and anxiety is common in pediatric intensive
      care unit (PICU) patients. Sedation/analgesia in PICU is usually achieved through
      various analgesics and sedatives. Excessive use of these drugs can put patients
      at risk for hemodynamic/respiratory instability, prolonged ventilation,
      withdrawal, delirium, and critical illness polyneuromyopathy.The use of
      non-pharmacologic interventions has been recommended by sedation guidelines.
      However, non-pharmacological measures in PICU, including music and noise
      reduction, have been inadequately studied. Methods: The Music Use for Sedation in
      Critically ill Children (MUSiCC trial) pilot study is an investigator-initiated, 
      three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the use of music for sedation in 
      PICU. The main goal of the study is to demonstrate feasibility of a music trial
      in PICU and to obtain the necessary information to plan a larger trial. The study
      compares music versus noise cancelation versus control in sedated and
      mechanically ventilated children admitted to PICU. In the music group, children
      receive the music (modified classical music) three times a day for 30 min at a
      time. Music is delivered with noise cancelation headphones. The noise cancelation
      group receives the same intervention but with a no music (sham playlist). The
      control group receives usual care with no specific intervention. Children remain 
      in the study until extubation or a maximum of 7 days. The primary outcomes of the
      study are feasibility and sedation/analgesia requirements. Secondary outcomes
      include change in vital signs before and during the intervention, ICU delirium,
      and adverse effects related to the intervention. The estimated sample size is 20 
      subjects per group for a total of 60 children. Discussion: Despite being
      recommended by current guidelines, evidence to support the use of music in PICU
      is lacking. Music has the potential to reduce sedation requirements and their
      negative side effects. This pilot RCT will demonstrate feasibility and provide
      the necessary information to plan a larger trial focusing on the effectiveness of
      the intervention. Trial registration: The study was registered at
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03497559) on April 13, 2018.

      receptor-based effects. It has been proposed that agonists selectively promote
      receptors to recruit one cellular interacting partner over another, introducing
      allosteric ‘bias’ into the signaling system. However, the underlying hypothesis -
      that different agonists drive GPCRs to engage different cytoplasmic proteins in
      living cells - remains untested due to the complexity of readouts through which
      receptor-proximal interactions are typically inferred. We describe a cell-based
      assay to overcome this challenge, based on GPCR-interacting biosensors that are
      disconnected from endogenous transduction mechanisms. Focusing on opioid
      receptors, we directly demonstrate differences between biosensor recruitment
      produced by chemically distinct opioid ligands in living cells. We then show that
      selective recruitment applies to GRK2, a biologically relevant GPCR regulator,
      through discrete interactions of GRK2 with receptors or with G protein beta-gamma
      subunits which are differentially promoted by agonists.

TI  - Emerging Potential of Exosomes in Regenerative Medicine for Temporomandibular
      Joint Osteoarthritis.
LID - 1541
AB  - Exosomes are nanosized vesicles (30–140 nm) of endocytic origin that play
      important roles in regenerative medicine. They are derived from cell membranes
      during endocytic internalization and stabilize in biological fluids such as blood
      and synovia. Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ OA) is a degenerative
      disease, which, in addition to chronic pain, is characterized by progressive
      cartilage breakdown, condylar bone remodeling, and synovitis. However,
      traditional clinical treatments have limited symptom- and structure-modifying
      effects to restore damaged cartilage and other TMJ tissues. This is due to the
      limited self-healing capacity of condylar cartilage. Recently, stem-cell-derived 
      exosomes have been studied as an alternative therapeutic approach to tissue
      repair and regeneration. It is known that trophic regulation of mesenchymal stem 
      cells (MSCs) has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects under
      pathological conditions, and research on MSC-derived exosomes is rapidly
      accumulating. MSC-derived exosomes mimic the major therapeutic effects of MSCs.
      They affect the activity of immune effector cells and possess multilineage
      differentiation potential, including chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation.
      Furthermore, exosomes are capable of regenerating cartilage or osseous
      compartments and restoring injured tissues and can treat dysfunction and pain
      caused by TMJ OA. In this review, we looked at the uniqueness of TMJ, the
      pathogenesis of TMJ OA, and the potential role of MSC-derived exosomes for TMJ
      cartilage and bone regeneration.

TI  - Predicting Acute Postoperative Pain Trajectories and Long-Term Outcomes of
      Adolescents after Spinal Fusion Surgery.
LID - 9874739
AB  - Objectives: Acute pain trajectories are associated with long-term outcomes such
      as persistent pain and functional disability in adults. However, there are
      limited data on acute postoperative pain trajectories in the pediatric
      population. The aims of this study were to investigate acute postoperative pain
      trajectories, their predictors, and their impact on long- term outcomes in
      adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. Methods: We evaluated the preoperative
      pain intensity, use of analgesics, psychosocial measures and physical functioning
      of adolescents scheduled to undergo spinal fusion, and their average 6-hour
      self-reported pain intensity scores for their entire hospital stay. Six months
      after surgery, baseline variables were reassessed. We used growth mixture
      modeling to conduct acute postoperative pain trajectory analysis and to identify 
      predictors of pain trajectories. Generalized linear models were conducted to
      determine whether acute pain trajectories predict long-term outcomes. Results:
      One hundred and six patients were included in the best-fitted acute pain
      trajectory model that included four classes that differed in initial pain
      intensity and rates of change over time. Preoperative pain catastrophizer status 
      and use of analgesics significantly predicted pain trajectory membership.
      Furthermore, at the 6-month follow-up, patients experiencing moderate-to-severe
      pain in the acute postoperative period were more likely to report higher levels
      of pain severity, use pain medication, and miss a greater number of school/work
      days due to back pain in the last three months. Discussion. Preoperative
      assessment and analyzing the progression of pain in the acute postoperative
      period can help identify those at risk of negative long-term outcomes after
      surgery.

TI  - Effects of synbiotic supplementation on energy and macronutrients homeostasis and
      muscle wasting of critical care patients: study protocol and a review of previous
      studies.
LID - 221
AB  - Background: An extreme and persistent dysbiosis occurs among critically ill
      patients, regardless of the heterogeneity of disease. Dysbiosis in critically ill
      patients may make them prone to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, multi-organ
      failure (MOF), energy homeostasis disturbance, muscle wasting, and cachexia.
      Modulation of gut microbiota through synbiotics can be considered as a potential 
      treatment for muscle wasting and macronutrient homeostasis disturbances. Methods:
      This is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, parallel randomized
      controlled trial with the aim to evaluate the effects of synbiotic
      supplementation on energy and macronutrient homeostasis and muscle wasting in
      critically ill patients. A total of 40 hemodynamically stable, adult, critically 
      ill patients who receive enteral nutrition via a nasogasteric tube (NGT) in the
      24–48 h after admission to critical care will be included in this study. Eligible
      patients will be randomly assigned to receive Lactocare (ZistTakhmir) capsules
      500 mg every 12 h or a placebo capsule, which contains only the sterile maize
      starch and is similar to synbiotic capsules for 14 days. The synbiotic and
      placebo capsules will be given through the nasogastric tube, separately from
      gavage, after feeding. Discussion: Gut microbiota modulation through synbiotics
      is proposed to improve clinical prognosis and reduce infectious complications,
      ventilator dependency, and length of ICU stay by improving energy and
      macronutrient homeostasis and reducing muscle protein catabolism. Trial

TI  - PrEvention of posttraumatic contractuRes with Ketotifen 2 (PERK 2) – protocol for
      a multicenter randomized clinical trial.
LID - 123
AB  - Background: Injuries and resulting stiffness around joints, especially the elbow,
      have huge psychological effects by reducing quality of life through interference 
      with normal daily activities such as feeding, dressing, grooming, and reaching
      for objects. Over the last several years and through numerous research results,
      the myofibroblast-mast cell-neuropeptide axis of fibrosis had been implicated in 
      post-traumatic joint contractures. Pre-clinical models and a pilot randomized
      clinical trial (RCT) demonstrated the feasibility and safety of using Ketotifen
      Fumarate (KF), a mast cell stabilizer to prevent elbow joint contractures. This
      study aims to evaluate the efficacy of KF in reducing joint contracture severity 
      in adult participants with operately treated elbow fractures and/or dislocations.
      Methods/design: A Phase III randomized, controlled, double-blinded multicentre
      trial with 3 parallel groups (KF 2 mg or 5 mg or lactose placebo twice daily
      orally for 6 weeks). The study population consist of adults who are at least
      18 years old and within 7 days of injury. The types of injuries are distal
      humerus (AO/OTA type 13) and/or proximal ulna and/or proximal radius fractures
      (AO/OTA type 2 U1 and/or 2R1) and/or elbow dislocations (open fractures with or
      without nerve injury may be included). A stratified randomization scheme by
      hospital site will be used to assign eligible participants to the groups in a
      1:1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is change in elbow flexion-extension range of
      motion (ROM) arc from baseline to 12 weeks post-randomization. The secondary
      outcomes are changes in ROM from baseline to 6, 24 & 52 weeks, PROMs at 2, 6, 12,
      24 & 52 weeks and impact of KF on safety including serious adverse events and
      fracture healing. Descriptive analysis for all outcomes will be reported and
      ANCOVA be used to evaluate the efficacy KF over lactose placebo with respect to
      the improvement in ROM. Discussion: The results of this study will provide
      evidence for the use of KF in reducing post-traumatic joint contractures and
      improving quality of life after joint injuries. Trial registration: This study
      was prospectively registered (July 10, 2018) with ClinicalTrials.gov reference:
      NCT03582176.

TI  - Trajectory of migraine-related disability following long-term treatment with
      lasmiditan: results of the GLADIATOR study.
LID - 20
AB  - Background: Migraine is recognized as the second leading cause of disability
      globally. Lasmiditan is a novel, selective serotonin 5-HT1F receptor agonist
      developed for acute treatment of migraine. Here we analyzed effects of lasmiditan
      on migraine disability assessed with the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS)
      scale for interim data from a long-term safety study. Methods: Completers of two 
      single-attack parent studies were offered participation in the 1 year GLADIATOR
      study, that randomized participants to treatment with lasmiditan 100 mg or 200 mg
      taken as needed for migraine attacks of at least moderate severity. Changes in
      MIDAS were modeled using a mixed model repeated measures analysis. Results: The
      sample included 1978 patients who received ≥1 lasmiditan dose and were followed
      for a median of 288 days. Baseline mean MIDAS scores for the lasmiditan 100-mg
      and 200-mg groups were 29.4 and 28.9, respectively, indicating severe
      migraine-related disability. Relative to baseline, MIDAS total scores were
      significantly lower at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months for both dose groups. At 12 months,
      changes in MIDAS scores were − 12.5 and − 12.2 for lasmiditan 100 mg and 200 mg, 
      respectively, with 49% and 53% of patients, respectively, achieving at least a
      50% decrease in MIDAS total score. Statistically significant improvements were
      also seen for work and/or school absenteeism and presenteeism, monthly headache
      days, and mean headache pain intensity at all time points up to 1 year. Findings 
      for patients who completed all visits versus those dropping out early were
      similar. Responses were generally similar for the lasmiditan 100 mg or 200 mg
      doses, between subgroups defined based on the number of baseline monthly migraine
      attacks (≤5 vs. >5), and also between subgroups defined by pain-free response
      (yes/no) during initial attacks. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with lasmiditan
      was associated with significant reductions in migraine-related disability,
      including both work or school absenteeism and presenteeism. The similarity of
      responses in completers and those who dropped out suggests that selective
      attrition does not account for the improvements. Benefits were significant at
      3 months and maintained through 12 months. Trial registration:

AB  - Background: Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium is a frequent secondary
      neurological complication in critically ill patients undergoing prolonged
      mechanical ventilation. Quantitative pupillometry is an emerging modality for the
      neuromonitoring of primary acute brain injury, but its potential utility in
      patients at risk of ICU delirium is unknown. Methods: This was an observational
      cohort study of medical-surgical ICU patients, without acute or known primary
      brain injury, who underwent sedation and mechanical ventilation for at least
      48 h. Starting at day 3, automated infrared pupillometry—blinded to ICU
      caregivers—was used for repeated measurement of the pupillary function, including
      quantitative pupillary light reflex (q-PLR, expressed as % pupil constriction to 
      a standardized light stimulus) and constriction velocity (CV, mm/s). The
      relationship between delirium, using the CAM-ICU score, and quantitative
      pupillary variables was examined. Results: A total of 59/100 patients had ICU
      delirium, diagnosed at a median 8 (5–13) days from admission. Compared to
      non-delirious patients, subjects with ICU delirium had lower values of q-PLR (25 
      [19–31] vs. 20 [15–28] %) and CV (2.5 [1.7–2.8] vs. 1.7 [1.4–2.4] mm/s) at day 3,
      and at all additional time-points tested (p < 0.05). After adjusting for the SOFA
      score and the cumulative dose of analgesia and sedation, lower q-PLR was
      associated with an increased risk of ICU delirium (OR 1.057 [1.007–1.113] at day 
      3; p = 0.03). Conclusions: Sustained abnormalities of quantitative pupillary
      variables at the early ICU phase correlate with delirium and precede clinical
      diagnosis by a median 5 days. These findings suggest a potential utility of
      quantitative pupillometry in sedated mechanically ventilated ICU patients at high
      risk of delirium.

TI  - The efficacy of continuous versus single-injection femoral nerve block in Total
      knee Arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 121
AB  - Background: Continuous femoral nerve block (cFNB) has been developed to extend
      the analgesic effect since the efficacy of single-injection femoral nerve block
      (sFNB) is often limited to approximately 16–24 h. The aim of this meta-analysis
      was to validate the add-on effect of cFNB in the setting of a multimodal
      analgesic protocol. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature review on
      Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library and PubMed. Eight randomized
      controlled trials (N = 626) that compared the efficacy of cFNB with sFNB were
      included. The primary outcome domains consist of visual analog scale (VAS) score 
      at postoperative 24 and 48 h. The secondary outcome domains include opioid
      consumption, length of hospital stay and incidence of nausea. Results: Our
      analysis revealed that cFNB was associated with a lower VAS score at 24 h (SMD:
      -0.277;95% CI − 0.503 to − 0.05). However, the difference of VAS score did not
      meet the minimal clinically importance difference for total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA). VAS score at 48 h was similar between the cFNB and sFNB group. The cFNB
      group was associated with less amount of opioids consumed at both 24(SMD:
      -1.056;95% CI − 1.737 to − 0.375) and 48 h(SMD: -1.040;95% CI − 1.790 to
      − 0.289). Length of hospital stay and incidence of nausea were similar between
      the two groups. Conclusion: In the setting of a multimodal analgesic protocol,
      patients might benefit from cFNB with regards to a reduced need of opioids in the
      early postoperative period. However, we did not find a clinically significant
      difference in pain scores at different time points between the cFNB and sFNB
      group. Level of evidence: I; meta-analysis.

TI  - Perception of prescribing factors and purchase statistics of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs in an orthopedic clinic.
LID - 100
AB  - Objectives: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are associated with
      concern of adverse drug reactions (ADRS) including gastrointestinal,
      cardiovascular, renal, and musculoskeletal. Non-selective and selective NSAIDS
      are proposed to differ with regard to their potential to cause ADRS. The aim of
      this pilot study was to compare perception of prescribing factors and purchase
      statistics of NSAIDS among physicians in a Norwegian orthopedic clinic. Results: 
      Forty-five (55%) of 82 invited physicians from the orthopedic clinic participated
      anonymous in a survey in February 2017. Effect and ADRS were rated as the most
      important factors for prescribing of NSAIDS. The participants were equally
      concerned about specific ADRS for prescription of non-selective and selective
      NSAIDS irrespective of type of ADR. They were generally more concerned about
      cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal ADRS than musculoskeletal. Purchase
      statistics from 2015 and 2016 showed that celecoxib, a selective NSAID, dominated
      in the orthopedic clinic. The discrepancy between perception of prescribing
      factors and purchase statistics of NSAIDS was possibly explained by a high degree
      of conformity to clinic guidelines. Our preliminary results indicate that
      perception of prescribing factors of NSAIDS among orthopedics should be surveyed 
      in multicenter or multinational studies.

TI  - Consistency between anticholinergic burden scales in the elderly with fractures.
LID - e0228532
AB  - Objective: Falls and bone fractures are important causes of morbidity and
      mortality in the elderly. The objective of this study was to identify the degree 
      of consistency between the anticholinergic scales used for patients diagnosed
      with fractures. Methods: This was an analytical agreement study conducted in
      patients diagnosed with vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in Colombia. The
      quadratic-weighted kappa coefficient was used to identify the consistency between
      the Anticholinergic Drug Scale-ADS, Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale-ACB
      and Anticholinergic Risk Scale-ARS in assessing the prescriptions of fracture
      patients during the month prior to the fracture, during their stay as an
      inpatient and at discharge, according to Landis criteria. Results: 220 patients
      with fractures were included, with a mean age of 75.3±10.3 years, and 68.2% were 
      women. The ACB scale identified the highest anticholinergic burden (26.8%) in
      prescriptions made the month before the fracture, and the highest agreement was
      between ACB and ADS (0.717); during hospitalization and at discharge, the
      cholinergic antagonists were best identified with ADS (77.7% and 72.1%,
      respectively), with the best agreement between ACB and ARS (0.613 and 0.568,
      respectively). The prescription of tramadol was found in 64.1% of hospitalized
      patients and in 61.4% of patients at the time of discharge. Conclusions: The
      scales evaluated show marked discrepancies between them, with highly variable
      frequencies of anticholinergic drugs identified at the different prescription
      times, and with low agreement among them, which is why the scales are not
      interchangeable in patients with bone fractures.

TI  - Benzodiazepines in the oral fluid of Spanish drivers.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Driving under the influence of alcohol, illicit drugs and certain
      medicines is not allowed worldwide. Roadside drug testing is considered an
      important tool for determining such behavior. In Spain, mandatory roadside oral
      fluid drug testing is carried out regularly. The aim of this study was to
      determine the prevalence of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepines in combination
      with other drugs in drivers, examine benzodiazepine concentrations in drivers,
      and analyze the association of these factors with age and sex. Methods: This
      study assessed data on Spanish drivers with confirmed drug-positive results
      recorded by the Spanish National Traffic Agency (Dirección General de Tráfico)
      between 2011 and 2016, accounting for 179,645 tests and 65,244 confirmed
      drug-positive tests. Results: Benzodiazepines were confirmed in 4.3% of all
      positive roadside drug tests. In most of those cases (97.1%), other substances
      were also detected, particularly cocaine (75.3%) and cannabis (64.0%). The
      frequency of benzodiazepine-positive drivers (OR, 1.094; 95% CI, 1.088–1.100)
      increased with age, while the frequency of drivers who tested positive for
      benzodiazepines in conjunction with other substances, compared with drivers who
      tested positive for benzodiazepines alone, decreased with age (OR, 0.903; 95% CI,
      0.825–0.988). Nordiazepam (54.8%) and alprazolam (46.9%) were the most common
      benzodiazepines detected. Conclusion: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and
      other psychoactive substances was found to be a common behavior among drivers who
      tested positive on the road. It is important to raise awareness of all those
      involved in the consumption of driving-impairing substances (authorities,
      healthcare providers, patients and their families, etc.): roadside detection of
      driving-impairing substances is suggested, in addition to promoting the use of
      fewer driving-impairing medications and the provision of clear information to
      patients.

TI  - Evidence for Dietary Agmatine Sulfate Effectiveness in Neuropathies Associated
      with Painful Small Fiber Neuropathy. A Pilot Open-Label Consecutive Case Series
      Study.
LID - 576
AB  - Peripheral neuropathies associated with painful small fiber neuropathy (SFN) are 
      complex conditions, resistant to treatment with conventional medications.
      Previous clinical studies strongly support the use of dietary agmatine as a safe 
      and effective treatment for neuropathic pain. Based on this evidence, we
      conducted an open-label consecutive case series study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of agmatine in neuropathies associated with painful SFN (Study
      Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov, System Identifier: NCT01524666). Participants
      diagnosed with painful SFN and autonomic dysfunctions were treated with 2.67
      g/day agmatine sulfate (AgmaSet® capsules containing G-Agmatine® brand of
      agmatine sulfate) for a period of 2 months. Before the beginning (baseline) and
      at the end of the treatment period, participants answered the established 12-item
      neuropathic pain questionnaire specifically developed to distinguish symptoms
      associated with neuropathy and to quantify their severity. Secondary outcomes
      included other treatment options and a safety assessment. Twelve patients were
      recruited, and 11 patients—8 diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy, two with
      idiopathic neuropathy and one with inflammatory neuropathy—completed the study.
      All patients showed improvement in neuropathic pain to a varied extent. The
      average decrease in pain intensity was 26.0 rating points, corresponding to a
      46.4% reduction in overall pain (p < 0.00001). The results suggest that dietary
      agmatine sulfate has a significant effect in reducing neuropathic pain intensity 
      associated with painful SFN resistant to treatment with conventional neuropathic 
      pain medications. Larger randomized placebo-controlled studies are expected to
      establish agmatine sulfate as a preferred treatment.

TI  - Pain relief and improvement in quality of life with 10 kHz SCS therapy: Summary
      of clinical evidence.
PG  - 403-15
AB  - Objective: Chronic pain is a prevalent condition which has a significant effect
      on the lives of those it impacts. High‐frequency 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation
      (10 kHz SCS) has been shown to provide paresthesia‐free pain relief for a wide
      variety of pain indications. This article summarizes the current and emerging
      data as they relate to the clinical use of the therapy in various pain syndromes.
      Methods: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed electronic database
      using keywords related to 10 kHz SCS. The database was queried from 2013 to May
      2019. Articles reporting clinical studies that included human subjects
      permanently treated with 10 kHz SCS (Senza® system) were included in the review. 
      Recent and relevant conference proceedings known to the authors were also
      included. Results: The selected literature demonstrated significant evidence for 
      the efficacy of 10 kHz SCS in treating chronic back and leg pain (CBLP),
      including a randomized, controlled trial as well as prospective and retrospective
      studies. One‐year follow‐up responder rates (pain relief ≥50%) ranged from 60% to
      80%. Other studies and case series showed promising outcomes in specific
      conditions, including nonsurgical refractory back pain, neuropathic limb pain,
      complex regional pain syndrome, chronic widespread pain, chronic pelvic pain, and
      intractable headache. Subgroup analyses also pointed toward the potential of
      10 kHz SCS being successful when low‐frequency SCS has failed. The vast majority 
      of these studies reported improved quality of life (QOL) metrics and/or reduced
      opioid consumption. Conclusions: Level I evidence already exists for the efficacy
      of 10 kHz SCS in treating CBLP, supported by real‐world clinical experience.
      Other studies demonstrate the potential of the therapy across a range of chronic 
      pain etiologies, although larger confirmatory studies are recommended. Overall,
      the literature suggests that the therapy is associated with improved QOL as well 
      as reduced opioid consumption.

TI  - Identification of MOR-Positive B Cell as Possible Innovative Biomarker (Mu
      Lympho-Marker) for Chronic Pain Diagnosis in Patients with Fibromyalgia and
      Osteoarthritis Diseases †.
LID - 1499
AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) diagnosis follows the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
      criteria, based on clinical evaluation and written questionnaires without any
      objective diagnostic tool. The lack of specific biomarkers is a tragic aspect for
      FM and chronic pain diseases in general. Interestingly, the endogenous opioid
      system is close to the immune one because of the expression of opioid receptors
      on lymphocytes membrane. Here we analyzed the role of the Mu opioid receptor on B
      lymphocytes as a specific biomarker for FM and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. We
      enrolled three groups of females: FM patients, OA patients (chronic pain control 
      group) and healthy subjects (pain-free negative control group). We collected
      blood samples to apply immunophenotyping analysis. Written tests were
      administrated for psychological analysis. Data were statistically analyzed. Final
      results showed that the percentage of Mu-positive B cells were statistically
      lower in FM and OA patients than in pain-free subjects. A low expression of
      Mu-positive B cell was not associated with the psychological characteristics
      investigated. In conclusion, here we propose the percentage of Mu-positive B
      cells as a biological marker for an objective diagnosis of chronic pain suffering
      patients, also contributing to the legitimacy of FM as a truly painful disease.

TI  - Assessing the Role of Cannabis Use on Cortical Surface Structure in Adolescents
      and Young Adults: Exploring Gender and Aerobic Fitness as Potential Moderators.
LID - 117
AB  - Cannabis use in adolescents and young adults is linked with aberrant brain
      structure, although findings to date are inconsistent. We examined whether
      aerobic fitness moderated the effects of cannabis on cortical surface structure
      and whether gender may play a moderating role. Seventy-four adolescents and young
      adults completed three-weeks of monitored abstinence, aerobic fitness testing,
      and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). Whole-sample linear regressions
      examined the effects of gender, VO2 max, cannabis use, and their interactions on 
      the surface area (SA) and local gyrification index (LGI). Cannabis use was
      associated with greater cuneus SA. Gender-by-cannabis predicted precuneus and
      frontal SA, and precentral, supramarginal, and frontal LGI; female cannabis users
      demonstrated greater LGI, whereas male cannabis users demonstrated decreased LGI 
      compared to non-users. Aerobic fitness was positively associated with various SA 
      and LGI regions. Cannabis-by-aerobic fitness predicted cuneus SA and occipital
      LGI. These findings demonstrate that aerobic fitness moderates the impact of
      cannabis on cortical surface structure, and gender differences are evident. These
      moderating factors may help explain inconsistencies in the literature and warrant
      further investigation. Present findings and aerobic fitness literature jointly
      suggest aerobic intervention may be a low-cost avenue for improving cortical
      surface structure, although the impact may be gender-specific.

TI  - Monitoring Acute Pain in Donkeys with the Equine Utrecht University Scale for
      Donkeys Composite Pain Assessment (EQUUS-DONKEY-COMPASS) and the Equine Utrecht
      University Scale for Donkey Facial Assessment of Pain (EQUUS-DONKEY-FAP).
LID - 354
AB  - Simple Summary: Pain can be difficult to objectively assess in animals,
      especially in prey animals that hide their symptoms from others. Donkeys are also
      known to mask and hide these signs. Owners often describe donkeys as “stubborn”, 
      but veterinarians and equine ethologists describe donkeys more as “stoic”. Among 
      veterinarians it is known that donkeys hide their pain symptoms even more than
      horses. Therefore, objective and valid pain measurement tools are needed to
      assess pain in donkeys. In this study, two pain scales (with behavioural
      elements, physiological elements, responses to interactions, and facial
      expressions) have been developed and tested in 79 donkeys with various types of
      acute pain (acute lameness, colic, head-related pain, and postoperative pain) and
      in 185 healthy pain-free control donkeys. The authors found that the Equine
      Utrecht University Scale for Donkey Composite Pain Assessment
      (EQUUS-DONKEY-COMPASS) and the Equine Utrecht University Scale for Donkey Facial 
      Assessment of Pain (EQUUS-DONKEY-FAP) can both be effective to objectively assess
      various types of acute pain in donkeys and could potentially be used to monitor
      pain and improve welfare in donkeys. Abstract: Objective pain assessment in
      donkeys is of vital importance for improving welfare in a species that is
      considered stoic. This study presents the construction and testing of two pain
      scales, the Equine Utrecht University Scale for Donkey Composite Pain Assessment 
      (EQUUS-DONKEY-COMPASS) and the Equine Utrecht University Scale for Donkey Facial 
      Assessment of Pain (EQUUS-DONKEY-FAP), in donkeys with acute pain. A cohort
      follow-up study using 264 adult donkeys (n = 12 acute colic, n = 25 acute
      orthopaedic pain, n = 18 acute head-related pain, n = 24 postoperative pain, and 
      n = 185 controls) was performed. Both pain scales showed differences between
      donkeys with different types of pain and their control animals (p < 0.001). The
      EQUUS-DONKEY-COMPASS and EQUUS-DONKEY-FAP showed high inter-observer reliability 
      (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.97 and 0.94, respectively, both p < 0.001). Sensitivity of 
      the EQUUS-DONKEY-COMPASS was good for colic and orthopaedic pain (83% and 88%,
      respectively), but poor for head-related and postoperative pain (17% and 21%,
      respectively). Sensitivity of the EQUUS-DONKEY-FAP was good for colic and
      head-related pain (75% and 78%, respectively), but moderate for orthopaedic and
      postoperative pain (40% and 50%, respectively). Specificity was good for all
      types of pain with both scales (91%–99%). Different types of acute pain in
      donkeys can be validly assessed by either a composite or a facial
      expression-based pain scale.

TI  - Paravertebral catheter versus EPidural analgesia in Minimally invasive Esophageal
      resectioN: a randomized controlled multicenter trial (PEPMEN trial).
LID - 142
AB  - Background: Thoracic epidural analgesia is the standard postoperative pain
      management strategy in esophageal cancer surgery. However, paravertebral block
      analgesia may achieve comparable pain control while inducing less side effects,
      which may be beneficial for postoperative recovery. This study primarily aims to 
      compare the postoperative quality of recovery between paravertebral catheter
      versus thoracic epidural analgesia in patients undergoing minimally invasive
      esophagectomy. Methods: This study represents a randomized controlled superiority
      trial. A total of 192 patients will be randomized in 4 Dutch high-volume centers 
      for esophageal cancer surgery. Patients are eligible for inclusion if they are at
      least 18 years old, able to provide written informed consent and complete
      questionnaires in Dutch, scheduled to undergo minimally invasive esophagectomy
      with two-field lymphadenectomy and an intrathoracic anastomosis, and have no
      contra-indications to either epidural or paravertebral analgesia. The primary
      outcome is the quality of postoperative recovery, as measured by the Quality of
      Recovery-40 (QoR-40) questionnaire on the morning of postoperative day 3.
      Secondary outcomes include the QoR-40 questionnaire score Area Under the Curve on
      postoperative days 1–3, the integrated pain and systemic opioid score and patient
      satisfaction and pain experience according to the International Pain Outcomes
      (IPO) questionnaire, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, the groups will be
      compared regarding the need for additional rescue medication on postoperative
      days 0–3, technical failure of the pain treatment, duration of anesthesia,
      duration of surgery, total postoperative fluid administration day 0–3,
      postoperative vasopressor and inotrope use, length of urinary catheter use,
      length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, chronic pain at six months 
      after surgery, and other adverse effects. Discussion: In this study, it is
      hypothesized that paravertebral analgesia achieves comparable pain control while 
      causing less side-effects such as hypotension when compared to epidural
      analgesia, leading to shorter postoperative length of stay on a monitored ward
      and superior quality of recovery. If this hypothesis is confirmed, the results of
      this study can be used to update the relevant guidelines on postoperative pain
      management for patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy. Trial

TI  - Randomized trial comparing low-pressure versus standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum
      in laparoscopic colectomy: PAROS trial.
LID - 216
AB  - Background: Laparoscopy, by its minimally invasive nature, has revolutionized
      digestive and particularly colorectal surgery by decreasing post-operative pain, 
      morbidity, and length of hospital stay. In this trial, we aim to assess whether
      low pressure in laparoscopic colonic surgery (7 mm Hg instead of 12 mm Hg) could 
      further reduce pain, analgesic consumption, and morbidity, resulting in a shorter
      hospital stay. Methods and analysis: The PAROS trial is a phase III,
      double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We aim to recruit 138 patients
      undergoing laparoscopic colectomy. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      either a low-pressure group (7 mm Hg) or a standard-pressure group (12 mm Hg).
      The primary outcome will be a comparison of length of hospital stay between the
      two groups. Secondary outcomes will compare post-operative pain, consumption of
      analgesics, morbidity within 30 days, technical and oncological quality of the
      surgical procedure, time to passage of flatus and stool, and ambulation. All
      adverse events will be recorded. Analysis will be performed on an
      intention-to-treat basis. Trial registration: This research received the approval
      from the Committee for the Protection of Persons and was the subject of
      information to the ANSM. This search is saved in the ID-RCB database under
      registration number 2018-A03028–47. This research is retrospectively registered
      January 23, 2019, at http://clinicaltrials.gov/ed under the name “LaPAroscopic
      Low pRessure cOlorectal Surgery (PAROS)”. This trial is ongoing.

TI  - A Study of Opiate, Opiate Metabolites and Antihistamines in Urine after
      Consumption of Cold Syrups by LC-MS/MS.
LID - 972
AB  - Studying the origin of opiate and/or opiate metabolites in individual urine
      specimens after consumption of cold syrups is vital for patients, doctors, and
      law enforcement. A rapid liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method
      using “dilute-and-shoot” analysis without the need for extraction, hydrolysis
      and/or derivatization has been developed and validated. The approach provides
      linear ranges of 2.5–1000 ng mL−1 for 6-acetylmorphine, codeine,
      chlorpheniramine, and carbinoxamine, 2.5–800 ng mL−1 for morphine and
      morphine-3-β-d-glucuronide, and 2.5–600 ng mL−1 for morphine-6-β-d-glucuronide
      and codeine-6-β-d-glucuronide, with excellent correlation coefficients (R2 >
      0.995) and matrix effects (< 5%). Urine samples collected from the ten
      participants orally administered cold syrups were analyzed. The results concluded
      that participants consuming codeine-containing cold syrups did not routinely pass
      urine tests for opiates, and their morphine–codeine concentration ratios (M/C)
      were not always < 1. In addition, the distribution map of the clinical total
      concentration of the sum of morphine and codeine against the antihistamines
      (chlorpheniramine or carbinoxamine) were plotted for discrimination of people who
      used cold syrups. The 15 real cases have been studied by using M/C rule, cutoff
      value, and distribution map, further revealing a potential approach to determine 
      opiate metabolite in urine originating from cold syrups.

TI  - Breast Cancer Care in Jordan.
LID - JGO.19.00279
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in Jordan and the third leading cause
      of cancer death after lung and colorectal cancers. Although the incidence of
      breast cancer in Jordan is lower than that in industrialized nations, the number 
      of new cases has been significantly increasing, and women present with breast
      cancer at a younger age and with more advanced disease than women in Western
      countries. Jordan is a medium-income country with limited resources and a young
      population structure. Therefore, breast cancer poses a particularly challenging
      burden on the country’s health care system. Despite ongoing endeavors to improve 
      breast cancer care at both public and private levels, more work is needed to
      achieve downstaging of the disease and improve access, awareness, and
      participation in early detection. Multimodality treatment facilities and
      supportive care are available; however, the quality of care varies widely
      according to where the patient is treated, and most treatment facilities remain
      located centrally, thus, creating access difficulties. The King Hussein Cancer
      Center, the only comprehensive cancer center in Jordan, has changed the practice 
      of oncology in the country via implementation of a multidisciplinary approach to 
      treatment, monitoring of treatment outcomes, and investments in ongoing cancer
      research. However, there remains no national system for ensuring provision of
      high-quality cancer care nationwide. Here, we review the epidemiology of breast
      cancer and the current status of breast cancer care in Jordan, we compare our
      treatment outcomes with international ones, and we highlight challenges and
      improvement opportunities.

TI  - Cytotoxic Immunity in Peripheral Nerve Injury and Pain.
LID - 142
AB  - Cytotoxicity and consequent cell death pathways are a critical component of the
      immune response to infection, disease or injury. While numerous examples of
      inflammation causing neuronal sensitization and pain have been described, there
      is a growing appreciation of the role of cytotoxic immunity in response to
      painful nerve injury. In this review we highlight the functions of cytotoxic
      immune effector cells, focusing in particular on natural killer (NK) cells, and
      describe the consequent action of these cells in the injured nerve as well as
      other chronic pain conditions and peripheral neuropathies. We describe how
      targeted delivery of cytotoxic factors via the immune synapse operates alongside 
      Wallerian degeneration to allow local axon degeneration in the absence of cell
      death and is well-placed to support the restoration of homeostasis within the
      nerve. We also summarize the evidence for the expression of endogenous ligands
      and receptors on injured nerve targets and infiltrating immune cells that
      facilitate direct neuro-immune interactions, as well as modulation of the
      surrounding immune milieu. A number of chronic pain and peripheral neuropathies
      appear comorbid with a loss of function of cellular cytotoxicity suggesting such 
      mechanisms may actually help to resolve neuropathic pain. Thus while the immune
      response to peripheral nerve injury is a major driver of maladaptive pain, it is 
      simultaneously capable of directing resolution of injury in part through the
      pathways of cellular cytotoxicity. Our growing knowledge in tuning immune
      function away from inflammation toward recovery from nerve injury therefore holds
      promise for interventions aimed at preventing the transition from acute to
      chronic pain.

TI  - Morphine Addiction and Oxidative Stress: The Potential Effects of Thioredoxin-1.
LID - 82
AB  - Long-term administration of morphine for the management of chronic pain will
      result in tolerance to its analgesic effect and could even cause drug dependence.
      Numerous studies have demonstrated significant redox alteration in morphine
      dependence and addiction. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) play important roles in
      controlling the cellular redox balance. In recent years, several recent studies
      have demonstrated that Trx-1 may be a promising novel therapeutic target for
      morphine addiction. In this article, we firstly review the redox alteration in
      morphine addiction. We also summarize the expression and the protective roles of 
      Trx-1 in morphine dependence. We further highlight the protection of
      geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a noncytotoxic pharmacological inducer of Trx-1, in 
      morphine-induced conditioned place preference. In conclusion, Trx-1 may be very
      promising for clinical therapy of morphine addiction in the future.

TI  - Unveiling the Impact of Morphine on Tamoxifen Metabolism in Mice in vivo.
LID - 25
AB  - Background: Tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancer and cancer recurrences.
      After administration, tamoxifen is converted into two more potent antitumor
      compounds, 4OH-tamoxifen and endoxifen by the CYP3A4/5 and 2D6 enzymes in human. 
      These active compounds are inactivated by the same UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
      isoforms as those involved in the metabolism of morphine. Importantly,
      cancer-associated pain can be treated with morphine, and the common metabolic
      pathway of morphine and tamoxifen suggests potential clinically relevant
      interactions.Methods: Mouse liver microsomes were used to determine the impact of
      morphine on 4OH-tamoxifen metabolism in vitro. For in vivo experiments, female
      mice were first injected with tamoxifen alone and then with tamoxifen and
      morphine. Blood was collected, and LC-MS/MS was used to quantify tamoxifen,
      4OH-tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, endoxifen, 4OH-tamoxifen-glucuronide, and
      endoxifen-glucuronide.Results:In vitro, we found increased Km values for the
      production of 4OH-tamoxifen-glucuronide in the presence of morphine, suggesting
      an inhibitory effect on 4OH-tamoxifen glucuronidation. Conversely, in vivo
      morphine treatment decreased 4OH-tamoxifen levels in the blood while dramatically
      increasing the formation of inactive metabolites 4OH-tamoxifen-glucuronide and
      endoxifen-glucuronide.Conclusions: Our findings emphasize the need for caution
      when extrapolating results from in vitro metabolic assays to in vivo drug
      metabolism interactions. Importantly, morphine strongly impacts tamoxifen
      metabolism in mice. It suggests that tamoxifen efficiency could be reduced when
      both drugs are co-administered in a clinical setting, e.g., to relieve pain in
      breast cancer patients. Further studies are needed to assess the potential for
      tamoxifen-morphine metabolic interactions in humans.

TI  - Mechanisms Linking Olfactory Impairment and Risk of Mortality.
LID - 140
AB  - Olfaction is a sense involved in a complex set of tasks, influencing eating
      behavior, increasing awareness of environmental hazards and affecting social
      communication. Surprisingly, smell disorders are very frequent, especially in the
      elderly population. Several recent studies conducted mostly in older subjects
      have demonstrated a strong association between olfactory impairment and overall
      mortality risk, with anosmia being even more predictive of 5 years mortality risk
      than cardiovascular disease. Presently, the underlying pathophysiology linking
      olfactory impairment to mortality remains unknown and only putative mechanisms
      are suggested. This review aims to examine the link between olfactory impairment 
      and mortality and to discuss existing ideas on underlying existing mechanisms
      including, (1) the effect of olfactory loss on nutrition, life-threatening
      situations and social interactions, (2) associated neurodegenerative diseases,
      (3) accelerated brain aging, and (4) reflection of general health status being
      reflected in olfactory function.

TI  - Perceptions and Beliefs Regarding NSAIDs in the Asia-Pacific Region.
PG  - 437-46
AB  - Background: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used in
      the treatment of pain and inflammation. However, chronic NSAID use may result in 
      gastrointestinal (GI), cardiovascular (CV), renal or other safety concerns,
      especially in high-risk populations. The aim of this review is to systematically 
      identify relevant literature and to organize available evidence for perceptions
      or beliefs of physicians and patients about the safety and efficacy of NSAIDs.
      Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE® (through
      PubMed®), Embase® (through Ovid®), and the Cochrane Library. Additional
      unstructured searches were conducted using Google Scholar™ and Google. The scope 
      of this study did not include grey literature searches or handpicking of cross
      references. This systematic analysis was conducted with a special interest in
      studies conducted in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region and information related to
      the COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) selective inhibitors. Results: Out of a total of
      2822 studies retrieved from different databases (PubMed®, Cochrane, Google
      Scholar™ and Embase®), 99 (3.5%) met the inclusion criteria. Further, out of
      these 99 studies, 23 APAC region studies were analyzed. The common perceptions
      were related to GI, CV, renal and respiratory safety, efficacy and COX-2
      inhibitors. Conclusion: Overall, the level of awareness among patients regarding 
      NSAIDs was observed to be considerably poor. Moreover, risk stratification by
      physicians must be practiced in order to decrease the incidence of adverse
      events.

TI  - Rural–Urban Differences in Hospitalizations for Opioid Use–Associated Infective
      Endocarditis in the United States, 2003–2016.
LID - ofaa045
AB  - Background: The incidence of infective endocarditis, a serious heart infection
      that can result from injection drug use, has increased in step with the opioid
      epidemic. Harm reduction services aimed at decreasing infectious complications of
      injection drug use are limited in rural areas; however, it is unknown whether the
      burden of opioid use–associated infective endocarditis varies between rural and
      urban populations. Methods: We used 2003–2016 National (Nationwide) Inpatient
      Sample data and joinpoint regression to compare trends in hospitalization for
      opioid use–associated infective endocarditis between rural and urban populations.
      Results: Rates of US hospitalizations for opioid use–associated infective
      endocarditis increased from 0.28 to 3.86 per 100 000 rural residents, as compared
      with 1.26 to 3.49 for urban residents (overall difference in annual percent
      change P < .01). We observed 2 distinct trend periods, with a period of little
      change between 2003 and 2009/2010 (annual percent change, 0.0% rural vs –0.08%
      urban) followed by a large increase in hospitalization rates between 2009/2010
      and 2016 (annual percent change, 0.35% rural vs 0.36% urban). Over the study
      period, opioid use–associated infective endocarditis hospitalizations shifted
      toward younger age groups for both rural and urban residents, and rural resident 
      hospitalizations increasingly occurred at urban teaching hospitals. For both
      groups, Medicaid was the most common payer. Conclusions: The increase in US
      hospitalizations for opioid use–associated infective endocarditis over the past
      decade supports the importance of public health efforts to reduce
      injection-related infections in both urban and rural areas. Future studies should
      examine factors affecting the higher increase in rate of these hospitalizations
      in rural areas.

TI  - Six-month retention and changes in quality of life and substance use from a
      low-threshold methadone maintenance therapy programme in Durban, South Africa.
LID - 13
AB  - Background: Emerging data points to a potential heroin use epidemic in South
      Africa. Despite this, access to methadone maintenance therapy and other
      evidence-based treatment options remains negligible. We aimed to assess
      retention, changes in substance use and quality of life after 6 months on
      methadone maintenance therapy provided through a low-threshold service in Durban,
      South Africa. Methods: We enrolled a cohort of 54 people with an opioid use
      disorder into the study. We reviewed and described baseline socio-demographic
      characteristics. Baseline and 6-month substance use was assessed using the World 
      Health Organization’s Alcohol Smoking and Substance Use Involvement Screening
      Test (ASSIST) and quality of life, using the SF-12. We compared changes at
      6 months on methadone to baseline using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and
      paired-tests for the ASSIST and SF-12 scores, respectively. McNemar’s test was
      used for comparisons between paired results of categorical variables relating to 
      injecting frequency. Results: The majority of the participants were young, Black 
      African males, with a history of drug use spanning over 10 years. Retention after
      6 months was 81%. After 6 months, the median heroin ASSIST score decreased from
      37 to 9 (p < 0.0001) and the cannabis ASSIST score increased from 12.5 to 21
      (p = 0.0003). The median mental health composite score of the SF-12 increased
      from 41.4 to 48.7 (p = 0.0254). Conclusions: Interim findings suggest high
      retention, significant reductions in heroin use and improvements in mental health
      among participants retained on methadone maintenance therapy for 6 months.
      Further research into longer term outcomes and the reasons contributing to these 
      changes would strengthen recommendations for the scale-up of methadone
      maintenance therapy in South Africa.

TI  - Gastrointestinal perforation: clinical and MDCT clues for identification of
      aetiology.
LID - 31
AB  - Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) perforation is a common medical emergency associated
      with considerable mortality, ranging from 30 to 50%. Clinical presentation
      varies: oesophageal perforations can present with acute chest pain, odynophagia
      and vomiting, gastroduodenal perforations with acute severe abdominal pain, while
      colonic perforations tend to follow a slower progression course with secondary
      bacterial peritonitis or localised abscesses. A subset of patients may present
      with delayed symptoms, abscess mimicking an abdominal mass, or with sepsis.Direct
      multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) findings support the diagnosis and
      localise the perforation site while ancillary findings may suggest underlying
      conditions that need further investigation following primary repair of ruptured
      bowel. MDCT findings include extraluminal gas, visible bowel wall discontinuity, 
      extraluminal contrast, bowel wall thickening, abnormal mural enhancement,
      localised fat stranding and/or free fluid, as well as localised phlegmon or
      abscess in contained perforations.The purpose of this article is to review the
      spectrum of MDCT findings encountered in GIT perforation and emphasise the MDCT
      and clinical clues suggestive of the underlying aetiology and localisation of
      perforation site.

TI  - The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σVreI is active during infection and
      contributes to phosphate starvation-induced virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
LID - 3139
AB  - The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σVreI of the human pathogen
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes transcription of potential virulence
      determinants, including secretion systems and secreted proteins. Its activity is 
      modulated by the VreR anti-σ factor that inhibits the binding of σVreI to the RNA
      polymerase in the absence of a (still unknown) inducing signal. The vreI-vreR
      genes are expressed under inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation, a physiological
      condition often encountered in the host that increases P. aeruginosa
      pathogenicity. However, whether or not σVreI is active in vivo during infection
      and contributes to the Pi starvation-induced virulence of this pathogen has not
      been analyzed yet. Using zebrafish embryos and a human alveolar basal epithelial 
      cell line as P. aeruginosa hosts, we demonstrate in this work that σVreI is
      active during infection and that lack of σVreI considerably reduces the Pi
      starvation-induced virulence of this pathogen. Surprisingly, lack of the σVreI
      inhibitor, the VreR anti-σ factor, also diminishes the virulence of P.
      aeruginosa. By transcriptomic analyses we show that VreR modulates gene
      expression not only in a σVreI-dependent but also in a σVreI-independent manner. 
      This includes potential virulence determinants and transcriptional regulators
      that could be responsible for the reduced virulence of the ΔvreR mutant.

TI  - A randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility of utilising virtual
      reality to facilitate analgesia during external cephalic version.
LID - 3141
AB  - External cephalic version (ECV) is associated with a moderate degree of pain.
      Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that has shown promise in offering
      procedural analgesia. We undertook a clinical pilot to assess the viability of VR
      to reduce pain during ECV. In an open randomised controlled trial (RCT), we
      randomised 50 women to either VR or standard care each (25 per group). Women
      receiving VR were administered VR content (Skylights) via a headset. Pre- and
      post-procedural measures of pain, anxiety, device experience and vital signs were
      measured. There were no significant differences between groups (VR/no VR) in pain
      scores (60.68 vs 49.76; p = 0.2), ECV success rates (80% vs 76%; p = 0.7) or
      anxiety levels. The women receiving VR had a significantly higher anticipation of
      pain pre-procedurally (70.0 vs 50.0; p = 0.03). 20 (80%) of the VR women
      indicated that they would use VR again and 22 (88%) indicated they would
      recommend it to a friend having ECV. There were no significant differences
      between groups for side effects encountered or changes in vital signs. We have
      shown that using VR during ECV is feasible and appears safe. Our results inform
      the design of future RCTs.

TI  - The risk of deliberate self-harm following a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or
      ankylosing spondylitis: A population-based cohort study.
LID - e0229273
AB  - Objective: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are
      associated with mental illness. The risk of serious mental illness, including
      deliberate self-harm (DSH), in these conditions is not well known. We aimed to
      determine if RA or AS independently increases the risk for DSH. Methods: We
      conducted retrospective, population-based cohort studies using administrative
      health data for the province of Ontario, Canada between April 1, 2002 and March
      31, 2014. Individuals with incident RA (N = 53,240) or AS (N = 13,964) were
      separately matched 1:4 by age, sex, and year with comparators without RA or AS.
      The outcome was a first DSH attempt identified using emergency department data.
      We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for risk of
      DSH in RA and AS versus comparators, adjusting for demographic, clinical and
      health service utilization variables. Results: Subjects with AS were
      significantly more likely to self-harm (crude incidence rate [IR] of 0.68/1,000
      person years [PY] versus 0.32/1,000 PY in comparators), with an adjusted HR of
      1.59 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.21). DSH was increased for RA subjects (IR 0.35/1,000 PY) 
      versus comparators (IR 0.24/1,000 PY) only before (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.74),
      but not after covariate adjustment (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.33). Conclusions:
      AS carries an increased risk for DSH but no such risk was observed in RA. Further
      evaluation of at-risk AS subjects is needed, including the longitudinal effects
      of disease and arthritis therapies on self-harm behaviour. This will inform
      whether specific risk-reduction strategies for DSH in inflammatory arthritis are 
      needed.

TI  - Deficits in pain medication in older adults with chronic pain receiving home
      care: A cross-sectional study in Germany.
LID - e0229229
AB  - Objective: To analyze the pattern and appropriateness of pain medications in
      older adults receiving home care. Methods: We performed a prospective
      cross-sectional study in patients ≥65 years old having chronic pain and receiving
      home care in Berlin, Germany. Data on prescribed pain medications were collected 
      using self-reported information, nursing documents, and medication plans during
      interviews at home. Pain intensity was determined with the numeric rating scale
      (NRS) and the Pain Assessment In Advanced dementia (PAINAD) scale. The Pain
      Medication Appropriateness Scale score (SPMAS) was applied to evaluate
      inappropriateness (i.e. a score ≤67) of pain medication. Results: Overall 322
      patients with a mean age of 82.1 ± 7.4 years (71.4% females) were evaluated. The 
      average pain intensity scores during the last 24 hours were 5.3 ± 2.1 and 2.3 ±
      2.3 on NRS and PAINAD scale (range 0–10, respectively). Sixty (18.6%) patients
      did not receive any pain medication. Among the treated patients, dipyrone was the
      most frequently prescribed analgesic (71.4%), while 50.8% and 19.1% received
      systemic treatment with opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      respectively. The observed median SPMAS was 47.6 (range 0–100) with 58 (18.0%) of
      patients achieving appropriate values. Half of the patients were treated with
      scheduled, while 29.9% were only treated with on-demand medications. Cognitive
      status had no effect on appropriateness of pain treatment. Conclusions: We
      observed substantial deficits in dosing patterns and appropriateness of pain
      medication in older adults with pain receiving home care. This applied to both
      patients with and without severe cognitive impairment.

TI  - Photobiomodulation therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on
      chronic neck pain patients: Study protocol clinical trial (SPIRIT Compliant).
LID - e19191
AB  - Introduction:: Chronic neck pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder that is
      associated with functional disability and decreased of quality of life.
      Electrophysical agents are commonly used to relieve pain, however the effects of 
      combined use of these agents are little studied. The objective is to investigate 
      the efficacy of photobiomodulation and electrical stimulation to relieve pain,
      both in isolation and combined. Materials and methods:: This a 4-arm randomized
      placebo-controlled trial with patient and evaluator blinded. This study will be
      performed in Department of Physical Therapy at Federal University of São Carlos, 
      São Carlos/SP, Brazil. One hundred and forty-four patients with chronic neck pain
      will be randomized into 4 groups: active photobiomodulation therapy with active
      electrical stimulation, active photobiomodulation therapy, active electrical
      stimulation, or placebo treatment. They will receive 10 sessions of treatment.
      Primary outcome: pain intensity (measured by pain numerical rating scale)
      posttreatment. Secondary outcomes: pain during movement, neck disability, range
      of motion, pressure pain threshold, temporal summation, conditioned pain
      modulation, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, quality of life, analgesic
      intake, and global perceived effect at posttreatment (10 sessions). Pain
      intensity and global perceived effect will also be measured after 6 weeks
      randomization. Discussion:: The findings of this study might clarify the
      importance of using the photobiomodulation therapy and transcutaneous electrical 
      nerve stimulation for patients with chronic neck pain. Trial registration::
      NCT04020861.

TI  - Association between neuropathic pain characteristics and DNA methylation of
      transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 in human peripheral blood.
LID - e19325
AB  - Elucidation of epigenetic mechanisms correlating with neuropathic pain in humans 
      is crucial for the prevention and treatment of this treatment-resistant pain
      state. In the present study, associations between neuropathic pain
      characteristics and DNA methylation of the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1
      (TRPA1) gene were evaluated in chronic pain patients and preoperative patients.
      Pain and psychological states were prospectively assessed in patients who
      suffered chronic pain or were scheduled for thoracic surgery. Neuropathic
      characteristics were assessed using the Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4)
      questionnaire. DNA methylation levels of the CpG islands in the TRPA1 gene were
      examined using whole blood. Forty-eight adult patients were enrolled in this
      study. Increases in DNA methylation rates at CpG -51 showed positive correlations
      with increases in the DN4 score both in preoperative and chronic pain patients.
      Combined methylation rates at CpG -51 in these patients also significantly
      increased together with increase in DN4 scores. Neuropathic pain characteristics 
      are likely associated with methylation rates at the promoter region of the TRPA1 
      gene in human peripheral blood.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of acupuncture on relieving abdominal pain and distension for
      acute pancreatitis: A protocol for systematic review.
LID - e19044
AB  - Introduction:: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of acupuncture on relieving abdominal pain and distension in acute pancreatitis. 
      Methods and analysis:: We will electronically search PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web
      of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, China National
      Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical Literature Database, China Science
      Journal Database, and Wanfang Database from their inception. Furthermore, we will
      manually retrieve other resources, including reference lists of identified
      publications, conference articles, and gray literature. The clinical randomized
      controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials related to acupuncture
      treating acute pancreatitis will be included in the study. The language is
      limited to Chinese and English. Research selection, data extraction, and research
      quality assessment will be independently completed by 2 researchers. Data will be
      synthesized using a fixed effects model or random effects model depending on the 
      heterogeneity test. The overall response rate and the visual analog scale score
      will be the primary outcomes. The time of first bowel sound, the time of first
      defecation, the length of hospitalization, acute physiology and chronic health
      evaluation II score, and the adverse events will also be assessed as secondary
      outcomes. RevMan 5 (version 5.3) statistical software will be used for
      meta-analysis, and the level of evidence will be assessed by Grading of
      Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Continuous data will be 
      expressed in the form of weighted mean difference or standardized mean difference
      with 95% confidence intervals, whereas dichotomous data will be expressed in the 
      form of risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Ethics and dissemination:: The
      protocol of this systematic review does not require ethical approval because it
      does not involve humans. We will publish this article in peer-reviewed journals
      and present at relevant conferences. PROSPERO registration number::
      CRD42019147503.

TI  - Predictors of 1-year mortality in patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation
      after surgery in intensive care unit: a multicenter, retrospective cohort study.
LID - 44
AB  - Objectives: The requirement of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) is
      associated with increased medical care demand and expenses, high early and
      long-term mortality, and worse life quality. However, no study has assessed the
      prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality among PMV patients, not less 
      than 21 days after surgery. This study analyzed the predictors of 1-year
      mortality in patients requiring PMV in intensive care units (ICUs) after surgery.
      Methods: In this multicenter, respective cohort study, 124 patients who required 
      PMV after surgery in the ICUs of five tertiary hospitals in Beijing between
      January 2007 and June 2016 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the duration of
      survival within 1 year. Predictors of 1-year mortality were identified with a
      multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. The predictive effect of the ProVent
      score was also validated. Results: Of the 124 patients enrolled, the cumulative
      1-year mortality was 74.2% (92/124). From the multivariable Cox proportional
      hazard analysis, cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.14, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 1.37–3.35; P < 0.01), no tracheostomy (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22–3.30;
      P < 0.01), enteral nutrition intolerance (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.19–2.97; P = 0.01),
      blood platelet count ≤150 × 109/L (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14–2.75; P = 0.01),
      requirement of vasopressors (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13–2.80; P = 0.02), and renal
      replacement therapy (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01–2.91; P = 0.047) on the 21st day of
      mechanical ventilation (MV) were associated with shortened 1-year survival.
      Conclusions: For patients who required PMV after surgery, cancer diagnosis, no
      tracheostomy, enteral nutrition intolerance, blood platelet count ≤150 × 109/L,
      vasopressor requirement, and renal replacement therapy on the 21st day of MV were
      associated with shortened 1-year survival. The prognosis in PMV patients in ICUs 
      can facilitate the decision-making process of physicians and patients’ family
      members on treatment schedule.

      and Endocannabinoid-Degrading Enzymes for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain
      Including Neuropathic Orofacial Pain.
LID - 1423
AB  - Neuropathic pain conditions including neuropathic orofacial pain (NOP) are
      difficult to treat. Contemporary therapeutic agents for neuropathic pain are
      often ineffective in relieving pain and are associated with various adverse
      effects. Finding new options for treating neuropathic pain is a major priority in
      pain-related research. Cannabinoid-based therapeutic strategies have emerged as
      promising new options. Cannabinoids mainly act on cannabinoid 1 (CB1) and 2 (CB2)
      receptors, and the former is widely distributed in the brain. The therapeutic
      significance of cannabinoids is masked by their adverse effects including
      sedation, motor impairment, addiction and cognitive impairment, which are thought
      to be mediated by CB1 receptors in the brain. Alternative approaches have been
      developed to overcome this problem by selectively targeting CB2 receptors,
      peripherally restricted CB1 receptors and endocannabinoids that may be locally
      synthesized on demand at sites where their actions are pertinent. Many
      preclinical studies have reported that these strategies are effective for
      treating neuropathic pain and produce no or minimal side effects. Recently, we
      observed that inhibition of degradation of a major endocannabinoid,
      2-arachydonoylglycerol, can attenuate NOP following trigeminal nerve injury in
      mice. This review will discuss the above-mentioned alternative approaches that
      show potential for treating neuropathic pain including NOP.

TI  - Effects of Orally Administered Resveratrol on TNF, IL-1β, Leukocyte Phagocytic
      Activity and Oxidative Burst Function in Horses: A Prospective, Randomized,
      Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Study.
LID - 1453
AB  - Resveratrol, a phytophenol, is a commonly used equine nutraceutical supplement
      touted to exert anti-inflammatory effects. The effect of orally administered
      resveratrol on tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), leukocyte
      phagocytic activity or oxidative burst function have not been reported in horses.
      The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a commercially
      available, orally administered resveratrol product on innate immune functions in 
      healthy adult horses. Whole blood was collected from 12 horses prior to and
      following 3 weeks of treatment with either the manufacturer’s recommended dose of
      resveratrol or placebo. Phagocytosis, oxidative burst and pathogen associated
      molecular pattern (PAMP) motif-stimulated leukocyte production of TNF and IL-1β
      were compared pre- and post-treatment between treatment groups. Phagocytosis and 
      oxidative burst capacity were evaluated via flow cytometry. Tumor necrosis factor
      and IL-1β were measured using cytotoxicity and ELISA assays, respectively. There 
      were no significant differences in phagocytosis, oxidative burst or stimulated
      TNF or IL-1β production between resveratrol and placebo treatment groups. Orally 
      administered resveratrol at a routinely recommended dose for a duration of 3
      weeks did not significantly affect phagocytic activity, oxidative burst function 
      or PAMP-stimulated leukocyte cytokine production.

TI  - Custom-Made Foot Orthoses Reduce Pain and Fatigue in Patients with Ehlers-Danlos 
      Syndrome. A Pilot Study.
LID - 1359
AB  - Background: Pain and fatigue are major clinical manifestations in patients with
      Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). The aim of this study is to measure change of the
      effects of custom-made foot orthotics on some manifestations related to EDS, such
      as foot pain, foot functionality, fatigue, and quality of life. Methods:
      Thirty-six patients with EDS wore foot orthoses for three months. Foot pain,
      foot-related disability, foot functionality, fatigue, and quality of life were
      measured using the 11-point Numeric Rating Scale, the Manchester Foot Pain and
      Disability Index, the Foot Function Index, the Fatigue Severity Score, and the
      12-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaires, respectively, at the beginning
      and after 3 months. Results: Participants demonstrated significantly improved
      foot pain (p = 0.002), disability related to foot pain (p < 0.001), foot
      functionality (p = 0.001), fatigue (p < 0.007), and mental health-related quality
      of life (p = 0.016). The physical health-related quality of life did not show
      significant changes. Conclusions: The use of custom-made foot orthoses help in
      the management of the symptoms by participants. This study could contribute to
      the foot specialists being considered as an additional member in
      multidisciplinary teams that are trying to develop an approach for patients with 
      EDS.

TI  - A user-friendly clinical practice guideline summary for managing low back pain in
      South Africa.
LID - 1366
AB  - Background: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide conveniently packaged
      evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decisions. However, intended
      end-users often do not know how to source, appraise, interpret or choose among
      CPGs. Moreover, it can be confusing when recommendations on the same topic differ
      among CPGs, in wording, intent and underpinning evidence. Objectives: This
      article reports on the processes of: (1) identifying current CPGs for acute and
      subacute low back pain (LBP) to fit the needs of South African physiotherapists, 
      (2) collating and summarising CPG recommendations to produce a user-friendly
      end-user product and (3) testing the utility of the summary CPG document on South
      African physiotherapy clinicians to efficiently determine acceptability,
      appropriateness and feasibility to inform clinical decision-making. Method: An
      adapted approach was followed by systematically searching online CPG repositories
      and online databases for LBP CPGs; screening and critically appraising identified
      CPGs; summarising recommendations from relevant CPGs and organising them into
      clinical practice activities. Feedback on utility was obtained from 11
      physiotherapists. Results: Three high-quality, international CPGs provided 25
      recommendations on the assessment and management of acute and subacute LBP
      relevant to South African physiotherapy practice. They were organised into 10
      headings. Physiotherapy user feedback suggested that this document would assist
      in clinical decision-making. Conclusion: Organised recommendations extracted from
      multiple, relevant CPGs provide an end-user-friendly resource for
      physiotherapists treating LBP. Clinical implications: Collated and organised CPG 
      recommendations may effectively assist South African physiotherapists’ clinical
      decision-making in assessing and managing patients with acute and subacute LBP.

      wounds in primiparous women.
LID - 11
AB  - Background:: Episiotomy is one of the most common surgical interventions
      performed to facilitate delivery. Anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of 
      Persian oak (Quercus persica) and henna (Lawsonia inermis) have been proved in
      previous studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Q. persica
      and L. inermis ointment on episiotomy wound healing in primiparous women and
      comparing it with placebo group. Materials and Methods:: This was a double-blind 
      clinical trial conducted on 160 primiparous women who underwent episiotomy. The
      cases were randomly selected and divided into four groups of forty patients
      including control, placebo, those who consume topical henna, and those who
      consume topical Persian oak ointment. Pain and recovery assessment was done at
      baseline and 7th, 10th, and 14th days after birth and measured by Redness, Edema,
      Ecchymosis, Discharge, and Approximation (REEDA scale) and patients’ pain
      intensity was also measured by a visual analog scale (VAS). The collected data
      were analyzed using Chi-square test, one-way ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA
      test by SPSS (version 22). Results:: The results revealed that according to the
      reduced score of REEDA till the 14th day after the delivery, the wound healing in
      the henna group and the oak group (−2.58 ± 0.29 and − 2.04 ± 0.31, respectively) 
      was higher than the control and placebo groups (−1.62 ± 0.34 and − 1.95 ± 0.32,
      respectively) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, on the 14th day, the mean VAS score was
      not significantly different between henna and oak groups (henna group: 2.58 ±
      0.25 and oak group: 2.23 ± 0.18); however, both intervention groups had a
      significant difference with the placebo and control groups (P < 0.05).
      Conclusion:: The findings showed that the use of henna and oak ointment improves 
      episiotomy wound healing process, so it is recommended for primiparous women.

LID - 20
AB  - Background:: Previous studies have shown that morphine negatively effects male
      fertility while Phoenix dactylifera (dates) could cure male infertility by the
      exhibition of antagonist effects. This study was conducted to assess the possible
      ameliorating effects of dates on the histological features of morphine-induced
      male rat reproductive organs. Materials and Methods:: Adult male Sprague Dawley
      rats age 7–9 weeks old, 200–250 g body weight (BW) were divided into six rats per
      each group: Group 1, force-fed with distilled water, 1 ml/kg BW for 35 days
      (control); Group 2, intramuscularly (IM) injected with morphine, 20 mg/kg BW for 
      7 days followed by force-fed with distilled water for 28 days; Group 3, force-fed
      with distilled water for 7 days followed by crude P. dactylifera extract, 200
      mg/kg for 28 days; Group 4, injected (IM) with morphine, 20 mg/kg BW for 7 days
      followed by force-fed of crude P. dactylifera extract, 200 mg/kg for 28 days.
      Rats were sacrificed on day 36. The seminal vesicle (SV) and prostate gland (PG) 
      were removed and fixed before histological processes. Results:: In
      morphine-treated rats, the SV showed the absence of honeycomb-like appearance
      with flattened columnar cells while in the PG, eosinophilic secretion was noted
      to be absent from glandular lumina as compared to the control group.
      Administration of P. dactylifera extract in Group 4 showed improvement in
      histoarchitecture of the SV and PG with complex mucosal infoldings and glands
      luminal filled with secretion. Conclusion:: P. dactylifera extract has a
      protective effect against the adverse effects of morphine on the male rat
      reproductive organs.

TI  - Aspirin and fracture risk: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis of
      observational studies.
LID - e026876
AB  - Objectives: This review provides insights into the potential for aspirin to
      preserve bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce fracture risk, building knowledge 
      of the risk-benefit profile of aspirin. Methods: We conducted a systematic review
      and exploratory meta-analysis of observational studies. Electronic searches of
      MEDLINE and Embase, and a manual search of bibliographies was undertaken for
      studies published to 28 March 2018. Studies were included if: participants were
      men or women aged ≥18 years; the exposure of interest was aspirin; and relative
      risks, ORs and 95% CIs for the risk of fracture or difference (percentage or
      absolute) in BMD (measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) between aspirin
      users and non-users were presented. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna
      Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists for observational studies. Pooled 
      ORs for any fracture and standardised mean differences (SMDs) for BMD outcomes
      were calculated using random-effects models. Results: Twelve studies met the
      inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Aspirin use was
      associated with a 17% lower odds for any fracture (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99; 
      I2=71%; six studies; n=511 390). Aspirin was associated with a higher total hip
      BMD for women (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.07; I2=0%; three studies; n=9686) and 
      men (SMD 0.06, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.13, I2=0%; two studies; n=4137) although these
      associations were not significant. Similar results were observed for lumbar spine
      BMD in women (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.09; I2=34%; four studies; n=11 330) and
      men (SMD 0.08; 95% CI −0.01 to 0.18; one study; n=432). Conclusions: While the
      benefits of reduced fracture risk and higher BMD from aspirin use may be modest
      for individuals, if confirmed in prospective controlled trials, they may confer a
      large population benefit given the common use of aspirin in older people.

TI  - Efficient Prediction of Vitamin B Deficiencies via Machine-Learning Using Routine
      Blood Test Results in Patients With Intense Psychiatric Episode.
LID - 1029
AB  - Background: Vitamin B deficiency is common worldwide and may lead to psychiatric 
      symptoms; however, vitamin B deficiency epidemiology in patients with intense
      psychiatric episode has rarely been examined. Moreover, vitamin deficiency
      testing is costly and time-consuming, which has hampered effectively ruling out
      vitamin deficiency-induced intense psychiatric symptoms. In this study, we aimed 
      to clarify the epidemiology of these deficiencies and efficiently predict them
      using machine-learning models from patient characteristics and routine blood test
      results that can be obtained within one hour. Methods: We reviewed 497
      consecutive patients, who are deemed to be at imminent risk of seriously harming 
      themselves or others, over a period of 2 years in a single psychiatric
      tertiary-care center. Machine-learning models (k-nearest neighbors, logistic
      regression, support vector machine, and random forest) were trained to predict
      each deficiency from age, sex, and 29 routine blood test results gathered in the 
      period from September 2015 to December 2016. The models were validated using a
      dataset collected from January 2017 through August 2017. Results: We found that
      112 (22.5%), 80 (16.1%), and 72 (14.5%) patients had vitamin B1, vitamin B12, and
      folate (vitamin B9) deficiency, respectively. Further, the machine-learning
      models were well generalized to predict deficiency in the future unseen data,
      especially using random forest; areas under the receiver operating characteristic
      curves for the validation dataset (i.e., the dataset not used for training the
      models) were 0.716, 0.599, and 0.796, respectively. The Gini importance of these 
      vitamins provided further evidence of a relationship between these vitamins and
      the complete blood count, while also indicating a hitherto rarely considered,
      potential association between these vitamins and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or
      thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Discussion: This study demonstrates that
      machine-learning can efficiently predict some vitamin deficiencies in patients
      with active psychiatric symptoms, based on the largest cohort to date with
      intense psychiatric episode. The prediction method may expedite risk
      stratification and clinical decision-making regarding whether replacement therapy
      should be prescribed. Further research includes validating its external
      generalizability in other clinical situations and clarify whether interventions
      based on this method could improve patient care and cost-effectiveness.

TI  - Transient Receptor Potential Channels and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
LID - 180
AB  - The transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels are present in abundance
      across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, serving as detectors for a variety of
      stimuli and secondary transducers for G-protein coupled receptors. The activation
      of TRP channels triggers neurogenic inflammation with related neuropeptides and
      initiates immune reactions by extra-neuronally regulating immune cells,
      contributing to the GI homeostasis. However, under pathological conditions, such 
      as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), TRP channels are involved in intestinal
      inflammation. An increasing number of human and animal studies have indicated
      that TRP channels are correlated to the visceral hypersensitivity (VHS) and
      immune pathogenesis in IBD, leading to an exacerbation or amelioration of the VHS
      or intestinal inflammation. Thus, TRP channels are a promising target for novel
      therapeutic methods for IBD. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the
      functions of TRP channels, especially their potential roles in immunity and IBD. 
      Additionally, we discuss the contradictory findings of prior studies and offer
      new insights with regard to future research.

TI  - Mapping of Morphine-Induced OPRM1 Gene Expression Pattern in the Adult Zebrafish 
      Brain.
LID - 5
AB  - Morphine is a potent analgesic opiate commonly used in treating pain, and it is
      also a substance of abuse and highly addictive. Hence, it is vital to discover
      the action sites of morphine in the brain to increase its efficacy of treatment. 
      In the present study, we aimed at identifying comprehensive neuroanatomical
      locations that are sensitive to morphine in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). We
      performed in situ hybridization to localize the mu opioid receptor (oprm1) gene
      and to map the morphine sensitive brain areas using neuronal PAS
      domain-containing protein 4a (npas4a), an early gene marker. Real-time PCR was
      used to detect changes in mRNA levels of oprm1 and npas4a in control and acute
      morphine treated fish (2 mg/L; 20 min). Intense positive oprm1 signals were seen 
      in the telencephalon, preoptic area, habenula, hypothalamic area and
      periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum. Acute morphine exposure
      significantly increased oprm1 and npas4a mRNA levels in the medial zone of dorsal
      telencephalon (Dm), ventral region of the ventral telencephalon (Vv), preoptic
      area, and in the hypothalamus but a decrease in oprm1 and npas4a signals in the
      dorsal habenula. This study provides a detailed map of oprm1 localization in the 
      brain, which includes previously unreported oprm1 in the habenula of teleost.
      Presence of oprm1 in multiple brain sites implies multiple action targets of
      morphine and potential brain functions which could include reward, cognitive and 
      negative emotions.

TI  - Opioid losses in terms of dosage and value, January 2012 to September 2017: a
      retrospective analysis of Health Canada data.
PG  - E113-9
AB  - Background:: Canadian health care facilities must report losses or thefts of
      opioids to Health Canada. To broaden the understanding of opioid loss in Canada, 
      we analyzed data describing these losses to estimate the amount of opioid lost,
      estimate the wholesale and street value, compare the distribution of loss types
      between facility types and compare loss trends. Methods:: We analyzed Health
      Canada records of losses of codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine and
      oxycodone reported by Canadian facilities from January 2012 to September 2017. We
      conducted descriptive analyses of the opioid losses by calculating milligrams of 
      drug lost, oral morphine equivalents, daily defined doses, approximate wholesale 
      value and approximate street value, and compared loss trends when counted by
      incidents, dosage units or milligrams. Results:: There were 64 963 reports of
      loss of codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine or oxycodone over the study
      period. Over 112 kg of opioids were lost, an estimated $8.7 million in wholesale 
      cost and $136 million in street value. The dominant loss categories varied by
      facility type: armed robbery (30.9 kg [31.1%]) for community pharmacies,
      unexplained losses (6.4 kg [55.8%]) for companies and pilferage (0.8 kg [57.4%]) 
      for hospitals. Loss trends over the study period varied by reporting metric and
      facility type: community pharmacy losses increased when measured by dosage units 
      and incidents of loss, and remained stable when measured by milligrams; hospital 
      losses increased when measured by milligrams and showed no clear trend when
      measured by dosage units and incidents of loss. Companies showed no clear loss
      trend with any reporting metric. Interpretation:: Large quantities of opioids
      were lost or stolen from community pharmacies, companies and hospitals over the
      study period, and these losses are valued in millions of dollars. Publishing
      milligrams of opioids lost annually alongside metrics such as dosage units and
      incidents of loss would help characterize the economic cost and the magnitude of 
      drug losses.

TI  - COMT gene variants and β-endorphin levels contribute to ethnic differences in
      experimental pain sensitivity.
LID - 1744806920908474
AB  - This cross-sectional study investigated whether the catechol-O-methyltransferase 
      (COMT) gene acts as a significant regulator of pain signaling pathways, regulates
      β-endorphin, and contributes to ethnic differences in pain sensitivity.
      One-hundred-sixty healthy subjects were enrolled in this study, with Han and
      Uyghur groups each consisting of 80 participants. Subjects went through six pain 
      threshold experiments. From venous blood, COMT polymorphisms were genotyped, and 
      serum β-endorphin levels were measured. Bivariate correlation analysis and
      multiple linear regression were used to identify the relationships among
      genotypes or β-endorphin levels and different types of pain thresholds. Han and
      Uyghur ethnic differences were determined in terms of acute-pressure
      pain-perception thresholds, blunt-pressure pain-perception thresholds,
      blunt-pressure pain-tolerance thresholds, electric pain-tolerance thresholds,
      β-endorphin levels, and distributions of rs4680 and rs4633 COMT polymorphisms.
      β-endorphin levels did not correlate with COMT rs4680 or rs4633 genotypes in both
      Han and Uyghur. Statistical predictors for a lower pain-threshold performance
      included being young, Uyghur, female, and having a low body mass index, low
      β-endorphin level, and the rs4680 GA or GG allele. There is the significant
      difference in pain sensitivity between healthy Han and Uyghur. COMT gene variants
      and β-endorphin levels contribute to ethnic differences in pain sensitivity.

TI  - Keel bone fractures induce a depressive-like state in laying hens.
LID - 3007
AB  - In commercial flocks of laying hens, keel bone fractures (KBFs) are prevalent and
      associated with behavioural indicators of pain. However, whether their impact is 
      severe enough to induce a depressive-like state of chronic stress is unknown. As 
      chronic stress downregulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in mammals and 
      birds, we employ this measure as a neural biomarker of subjective welfare state. 
      Radiographs obtained longitudinally from Lohmann Brown laying hens housed in a
      commercial multi-tier aviary were used to score the severity of
      naturally-occurring KBFs between the ages of 21–62 weeks. Individual birds’
      transitions between aviary zones were also recorded. Focal hens with severe KBFs 
      at 3–4 weeks prior to sampling (n = 15) had lower densities of immature
      doublecortin-positive (DCX+) multipolar and bipolar neurons in the hippocampal
      formation than focal hens with minimal fractures (n = 9). KBF severity scores at 
      this time also negatively predicted DCX+ cell numbers on an individual level,
      while hens that acquired fractures earlier in their lives had fewer DCX+ neurons 
      in the caudal hippocampal formation. Activity levels 3–4 weeks prior to sampling 
      were not associated with AHN. KBFs thus lead to a negative affective state
      lasting at least 3–4 weeks, and management steps to reduce their occurrence are
      likely to have significant welfare benefits.

LID - e52694
AB  - The rates of opioid overdose in the United States quadrupled between 1999 and
      2017, reaching a staggering 130 deaths per day. This health epidemic demands
      innovative solutions that require uncovering the key brain areas and cell types
      mediating the cause of overdose— opioid-induced respiratory depression. Here, we 
      identify two primary changes to murine breathing after administering opioids.
      These changes implicate the brainstem’s breathing circuitry which we confirm by
      locally eliminating the µ-Opioid receptor. We find the critical brain site is the
      preBötzinger Complex, where the breathing rhythm originates, and use genetic
      tools to reveal that just 70–140 neurons in this region are responsible for its
      sensitivity to opioids. Future characterization of these neurons may lead to
      novel therapies that prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.

TI  - Aromatase Inhibitors and Risk of Arthritis and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome among
      Taiwanese Women with Breast Cancer: A Nationwide Claims Data Analysis.
LID - 566
AB  - Tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy may prevent breast cancer
      recurrence, however, adverse effects may lead to treatment discontinuation.
      Evidence regarding the occurrence of AI-associated musculoskeletal problems among
      Asians is scarce. We identified women with breast cancer-initiating tamoxifen or 
      AIs from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (2007–2012).
      Using multivariable cause-specific hazard models, we examined the association
      between endocrine therapy and the risk of any arthritis and carpal tunnel
      syndrome, adjusting for age, prior cancer treatment, and other health status
      factors. Among 32,055 eligible women with breast cancer (mean age = 52.6 ± 11.5
      years), 87.4% initiated tamoxifen, 3.9% initiated anastrozole, 8.0% initiated
      letrozole, and 0.7% initiated exemestane. AI users had a higher 1-year cumulative
      incidence for any arthritis (13.0% vs. 8.2%, p < 0.0001) and carpal tunnel
      syndrome (1.4% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.008). Compared to tamoxifen users, AI users had a 
      higher risk of any arthritis [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.21, 95%CI =
      1.09–1.34] and carpal tunnel syndrome (aHR = 1.68, 95%CI = 1.22–2.32). No
      significant difference was observed in the risks of any arthritis and carpal
      tunnel syndrome across different AIs. Taxane use was not associated with any
      arthritis (aHR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.81–1.05) or carpal tunnel syndrome (aHR = 0.97, 
      95%CI = 0.67–1.40) compared to other chemotherapies. Taiwanese women with breast 
      cancer-initiating AIs had an increased risk of arthritis and carpal tunnel
      syndrome compared to those who initiated tamoxifen.

TI  - Effect of Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy on Pain Intensity, Functional 
      Efficiency, and Postural Control Parameters in Patients with Chronic Low Back
      Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
LID - 568
AB  - Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide, placing a
      significant economic burden on healthcare systems. Radial extracorporeal shock
      wave therapy (rESWT) is useful in the rehabilitation of orthopedic diseases;
      however, there is still limited evidence for patients with LBP. The aim of this
      study was to assess the effect of rESWT on pain level, functional efficiency, and
      parameters of postural control in patients with LBP. Participants were randomized
      into group A (n = 20) treated with rESWT and group B (n = 20) treated with sham
      rESWT (placebo). Both groups received conventional physiotherapy, including core 
      stability exercises. The following tests were performed: the Laitinen Pain Scale 
      (LPS), the Roland–Morris Questionnaire (RMQ), the original Schober Test (OST),
      and a stabilometric platform for the assessment of postural sway, including total
      sway path (TSP). We found that the analgesic effect was higher after rESWT,
      especially in the follow-up’s (p < 0.05). Similar results were found for
      functional efficiency and range of motion (p < 0.05). The improved posture
      stability in placebo group B was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The
      stabilometric parameters in group A were still gradually improved and
      statistically significant, even in follow-ups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the
      rESWT had a significant effect on the reduction of pain and the improvement of
      functional condition compared to a conventional physiotherapy program. Also,
      rESWT with core stability exercises led to significant improvements in postural
      sway compared with conventional physiotherapy in patients with LBP.

TI  - Problem Gambling in the Fitness World—A General Population Web Survey.
LID - 1342
AB  - The world of sports has a complex association to problem gambling, and the sparse
      research examining problem gambling in athletes has suggested an increased
      prevalence and particularly high male predominance. The present study aimed to
      study frequency and correlates of problem gambling in populations with moderate
      to high involvement in fitness or physical exercise. This is a self-selective
      online survey focusing on addictive behaviors in physical exercise distributed by
      ‘fitness influencers’ on social media and other online fitness forums to their
      followers. Respondents were included if they reported exercise at least thrice
      weekly, were above 15 years of age, and provided informed consent (N = 3088).
      Problem gambling, measured with the Lie/Bet, was studied in association with
      demographic data, substance use, and mental health variables. The occurrence of
      lifetime problem gambling was 8 percent (12 percent in men, one percent in
      women). In logistic regression, problem gambling was associated with male gender,
      younger age, risky alcohol drinking, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and less
      frequent exercise habits. In conclusion, in this self-recruited population with
      moderate to high fitness involvement, problem gambling was moderately elevated.
      As shown previously in elite athletes, the male predominance was larger than in
      the general population. The findings strengthen the link between problem gambling
      and the world of sports.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs Regarding Drug Abuse and Misuse among Community
      Pharmacists in Saudi Arabia.
LID - 1334
AB  - Background and Objective: Several over-the-counter drugs have been documented as 
      an essential issue in the community pharmacy setting owing to their liability to 
      abuse. Pharmacists act as a critical monitor for these concerns and evaluate the 
      seriousness of the patients’ condition. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the
      knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding drug abuse and misuse among
      pharmacists at a community pharmacy in Riyadh city, Saudi Arabia. Methods: A
      cross-sectional study using a validated self-administered questionnaire was
      carried out among community pharmacists over three months April to June 2019. The
      survey had 25 items on the experience, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, strategies,
      and opinions of participants toward drug abuse and misuse. Results: A total of
      239 community pharmacists responded to the survey. About 84% of them had received
      training on drug misuse or abuse. The majority of community pharmacists (85.8%)
      would like to be provided educational programs on drug abuse in the future.
      Nearly all the pharmacists (94.9%) reported providing suitable advice to
      suspected drug misusers either in written or oral form at their pharmacies.
      Approximately 31% agreed or strongly agreed to dispense controlled drugs through 
      a pharmacy. Regarding the ethical matter of selling misusers controlled drugs,
      93.7% of the respondents believed that it is deceptive to offer misusers
      controlled medications. A comparison of knowledge and beliefs (univariate
      analysis) showed that the results were significant only for respondents who had
      graduated from Yemen (p = 0.007) and respondents who had an experience of four to
      six years or more (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The findings revealed that the majority
      of community pharmacists had been trained in recognizing drug abuse or dependence
      during their pharmacy college education. In addition, majority of them reported
      that they warned or counseled patients about the occurrence of adverse drug
      reactions to specific medications. However, majority of them agreed that selling 
      controlled drugs is unethical in a community pharmacy. Thus, effective
      implementation of pharmaceutical rules and laws is a fundamental need in the
      Saudi Arabian health care system and we suggest stringent execution of the
      regulations by the Saudi health care authorities.

TI  - Non-Adherence to Pharmacotherapy: A Prospective Multicentre Study About Its
      Incidence and Its Causes Perceived by Chronic Pain Patients.
PG  - 321-32
AB  - Objective: Pharmacological interventions remain the cornerstone of chronic pain
      treatment; however, nearly 40% of the prescription medicines are not taken as
      prescribed. The present study aims at understanding and describing non-adherence 
      from the perspective of chronic pain patients during a 1-year follow-up study.
      Methods: A cohort of 950 consecutive patients referred to a first consultation in
      Multidisciplinary Chronic Pain Clinics was followed with a standardized protocol 
      for 1 year. This included assessment of pain characteristics; prescribed
      medication; therapeutic adherence; effectiveness of treatment, non-adherence and 
      its perceived reasons; clinical outcomes and quality of life. We used a mixed
      methods approach, including qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results:
      Forty-nine percent of the 562 patients who responded to all assessments during
      follow-up were adherent after 1 year of chronic pain treatment. The core
      associations between each “non-adherence reason” and Anatomical Therapeutic
      Chemical Code (ATC) group were perceived side effects (p=0.019) and delayed start
      (p=0.022) for narcotic ﻿analgesics (opioids); perceived non-efficacy (p=0.017)
      and delayed start (p=0.004) for antiepileptics and anticonvulsants; perceived low
      necessity (p=0.041) and delayed start (p=0.036) for analgesics antipyretics;
      change in prescriptions because of a new clinical condition for antidepressants
      (p=0.024); high concerns (p=0.045) and change in prescriptions because of a new
      clinical condition (p<0.001) for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; delayed
      start (p=0.016) and financial constraints (p=0.018) for other medications.
      Discussion: This study emphasizes the patient’s perspective regarding
      non-adherence to pharmacological treatment of chronic pain, providing valuable
      and novel information to be used in future interventions to help patients make an
      informed choice about their adherence behavior.

TI  - A medical mystery of complex regional pain syndrome.
LID - e03329
AB  - Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a condition of neuropathic pain, which
      is characterized by significant autonomic and inflammatory features. CRPS occurs 
      in patients who have limb surgery, limb fractures, or trauma. Many patients may
      have pain resolve within twelve months of the inciting incident; however, a small
      subset progresses to the chronic form. This transitional process often happens by
      changing from warm CRPS with dominant inflammatory phase to cold CRPS, in which
      autonomic characteristics or manifestations dominate. Several peripheral and
      central mechanisms are involved, which might vary among individuals over a period
      of time. Other contributors include peripheral and central sensitization,
      autonomic alterations, inflammatory and immune changes, neurochemical changes,
      and psychological and genetic factors. Although effective management of the
      chronic CRPS form is often challenging, there are a few high quality randomized
      controlled trials that support the efficacy of the most commonly used therapeutic
      approaches.

TI  - The effectiveness of additional thoracic paravertebral block in improving the
      anesthetic effects of regional anesthesia for proximal humeral fracture surgery
      in elderly patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 204
AB  - Background: The innervation of the shoulder-upper-extremity area is complicated
      and unclear. Regional anesthesia with a brachial plexus and cervical plexus block
      is probably inadequate for the proximal humeral surgery. Missing blockade of the 
      T1–T2 nerves may be the reason. We conduct this prospective randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) to explore whether an additional T2 thoracic paravertebral block
      (TPVB) can improve the success rate of regional anesthesia for elderly patients
      in proximal humeral fracture surgery. Methods/design: The patients aged 65 years 
      or older, referred for anterior-approach proximal humeral fracture surgery, will 
      be enrolled. Each patient will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a combined
      interscalene brachial plexus with superficial cervical plexus block (IC)
      (combined interscalene brachial plexus with superficial cervical plexus block) or
      an IC block combined with thoracic paravertebral block (ICTP) block (combined
      thoracic paravertebral block with brachial plexus and superficial cervical plexus
      block). The primary outcome is the success rate of regional anesthesia without
      rescue analgesic methods. The secondary outcomes are as follows: sensory block at
      the surgical area, proportion of patients who need rescue anesthesia
      (intravenously administered remifentanil or conversion to general anesthesia),
      cumulative doses of intraoperative vasoactive medications and adverse events. The
      total sample size is estimated to be 80 patients. Discussion: This RCT aims to
      confirm whether an additional T2 TPVB can provide better anesthetic effects of
      regional anesthesia with brachial and cervical plexus block in elderly patients
      undergoing proximal humeral surgery. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: 
      NCT03919422. Registered on 19 April 2019.

TI  - Cannabinoids in Chronic Non-Cancer Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 1179544120906461
AB  - Background:: For patients with chronic, non-cancer pain, traditional
      pain-relieving medications include opioids, which have shown benefits but are
      associated with increased risks of addiction and adverse effects. Medical
      cannabis has emerged as a treatment alternative for managing these patients and
      there has been a rise in the number of randomized clinical trials in recent
      years; therefore, a systematic review of the evidence was warranted. Objective:: 
      To analyze the evidence surrounding the benefits and harms of medical
      cannabinoids in the treatment of chronic, non-cancer-related pain. Design::
      Systematic review with meta-analysis. Data sources:: Medline, Embase, CINAHL,
      SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Databases. Eligibility criteria:: English
      language randomized clinical trials of cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic,
      non-cancer-related pain. Data extraction and synthesis:: Study quality was
      assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. All stages were conducted
      independently by a team of 6 reviewers. Data were pooled through meta-analysis
      with different durations of treatment (2 weeks, 2 months, 6 months) and
      stratified by route of administration (smoked, oromucosal, oral), conditions, and
      type of cannabinoids. Main outcomes and measures:: Patient-reported pain and
      adverse events (AEs). Results:: Thirty-six trials (4006 participants) were
      included, examining smoked cannabis (4 trials), oromucosal cannabis sprays (14
      trials), and oral cannabinoids (18 trials). Compared with placebo, cannabinoids
      showed a significant reduction in pain which was greatest with treatment duration
      of 2 to 8 weeks (weighted mean difference on a 0-10 pain visual analogue scale
      −0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.96 to −0.40, I2 = 8%, P < .00001; n = 16 
      trials). When stratified by route of administration, pain condition, and type of 
      cannabinoids, oral cannabinoids had a larger reduction in pain compared with
      placebo relative to oromucosal and smoked formulations but the difference was not
      significant (P[interaction] > .05 in all the 3 durations of treatment);
      cannabinoids had a smaller reduction in pain due to multiple sclerosis compared
      with placebo relative to other neuropathic pain (P[interaction] = .05) within
      2 weeks and the difference was not significant relative to pain due to rheumatic 
      arthritis; nabilone had a greater reduction in pain compared with placebo
      relative to other types of cannabinoids longer than 2 weeks of treatment but the 
      difference was not significant (P[interaction] > .05). Serious AEs were rare, and
      similar across the cannabinoid (74 out of 2176, 3.4%) and placebo groups (53 out 
      of 1640, 3.2%). There was an increased risk of non-serious AEs with cannabinoids 
      compared with placebo. Conclusions:: There was moderate evidence to support
      cannabinoids in treating chronic, non-cancer pain at 2 weeks. Similar results
      were observed at later time points, but the confidence in effect is low. There is
      little evidence that cannabinoids increase the risk of experiencing serious AEs, 
      although non-serious AEs may be common in the short-term period following use.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Patients' Subjective Feelings Toward Total Hip
      Arthroplasty with Patient‐Specific Instruments and Traditional Total Hip
      Arthroplasty.
PG  - 269-76
AB  - Objective: To determine whether differences exist in patients' subjective
      feelings, daily life, and surgical satisfaction between those who underwent
      surgery for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) using patient‐specific
      instruments (PSIs) and those who underwent traditional surgical total hip
      arthroplasty (THA). Methods: We selected 30 adult patients with various types of 
      DDH who underwent surgery during 2016–2017 at our hospital. The patients were
      divided into PSI surgery group and the traditional surgery group. All patients
      underwent follow‐up, and we collected data on the Harris Hip Score, Oxford
      University Hip Score (OHS), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS‐12), Visual Analogue Scale
      (VAS) score, patient satisfaction score, intraoperative surgical time, amount of 
      bleeding and postoperative complications incidence for both groups. We then
      performed statistical analyses on the data. Results: The Harris Hip Score, OHS,
      VAS score, patient satisfaction score, and mean bleeding volume did not differ
      statistically significantly (t‐tests, P > 0.05). No statistically significant
      differences were found between surgical groups in the incidence of complication
      and sub‐trochanteric osteotomy, or in the surgical side (chi‐square tests,
      P > 0.05). For the experimental group, the FJS‐12 score was 80.0 ± 12.0, and for 
      the control group the score was 68.5 ± 16.1. The operative time of the
      experimental group was 138.4 ± 32.2 min, while that of the control group was
      88.9 ± 26.8 min. The values of these data differed significantly (t‐tests,
      P < 0.05). Conclusions: The novel PSI designed by our group has certain
      advantages for the short‐term subjective feelings of patients after THA, but it
      may cause prolonged operative times.

TI  - Influence of Ketorolac Supplementation on Pain Control for Knee Arthroscopy: A
      Meta‐Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 31-7
AB  - Introduction: The efficacy of ketorolac supplementation on pain control for knee 
      arthroscopy remains controversial. We conduct a systematic review and
      meta‐analysis to explore the impact of ketorolac supplementation on pain
      intensity after knee arthroscopy. Methods: We search PubMed, EMbase, Web of
      science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases through September 2018 for
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of ketorolac
      supplementation vs placebo on pain management after knee arthroscopy. This
      meta‐analysis is performed using the random‐effect model. Results: Ten RCTs
      involving 402 patients are included in the meta‐analysis. Overall, compared with 
      control group for knee arthroscopy, ketorolac supplementation is associated with 
      notably reduced pain scores at 1 h (MD = −0.66; 95% CI = −1.12 to −0.21; P =
      0.004) and 2 h (MD = −0.90; 95% CI = −1.74 to −0.07; P = 0.03), prolonged time
      for first analgesic requirement (MD = 1.94; 95% CI = 0.33 to 3.55; P = 0.02) and 
      decreased number of analgesic requirement (RR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.75; P = 
      0.003), but has no obvious impact on analgesic consumption (MD = −0.56; 95% CI = 
      −1.14 to 0.02; P = 0.06), as well as nausea and vomiting (RR = 0.44; 95% CI =
      0.12 to 0.21; P = 0.21). Conclusions: Ketorolac supplementation is effective to
      produce pain relief for knee arthroscopy.

TI  - Functional connectivity and structural analysis of trial spinal cord stimulation 
      responders in failed back surgery syndrome.
LID - e0228306
AB  - Background: Chronic pain has been associated with alterations in brain structure 
      and function that appear dependent on pain phenotype. Functional connectivity
      (FC) data on chronic back pain (CBP) is limited and based on heterogeneous pain
      populations. We hypothesize that failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients
      being considered for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy have altered resting
      state (RS) FC cross-network patterns that 1) specifically involve emotion and
      reward/aversion functions and 2) are related to pain scores. Methods: RS
      functional MRI (fMRI) scans were obtained for 10 FBSS patients who are being
      considered for but who have not yet undergone implantation of a permanent SCS
      device and 12 healthy age-matched controls. Seven RS networks were analyzed
      including the striatum (STM). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test evaluated differences
      in cross-network FC strength (FCS). Differences in periaqueductal grey (PAG) FC
      were assessed with seed-based analysis. Results: Cross-network FCS was decreased 
      (p<0.05) between the STM and all other networks in these FBSS patients. There was
      a negative linear relationship (R2 = 0.76, p<0.0022) between STMFCS index and
      pain scores. The PAG showed decreased FC with network elements and amygdala but
      increased FC with the sensorimotor cortex and cingulate gyrus. Conclusions:
      Decreased FC between STM and other RS networks in FBSS has not been previously
      reported. This STMFCS index may represent a more objective measure of chronic
      pain specific to FBSS which may help guide patient selection for SCS and
      subsequent management.

TI  - Current Advances in Allosteric Modulation of Muscarinic Receptors.
LID - 325
AB  - Allosteric modulators are ligands that bind to a site on the receptor that is
      spatially separated from the orthosteric binding site for the endogenous
      neurotransmitter. Allosteric modulators modulate the binding affinity, potency,
      and efficacy of orthosteric ligands. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are
      prototypical allosterically-modulated G-protein-coupled receptors. They are a
      potential therapeutic target for the treatment of psychiatric, neurologic, and
      internal diseases like schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington disease,
      type 2 diabetes, or chronic pulmonary obstruction. Here, we reviewed the progress
      made during the last decade in our understanding of their mechanisms of binding, 
      allosteric modulation, and in vivo actions in order to understand the
      translational impact of studying this important class of pharmacological agents. 
      We overviewed newly developed allosteric modulators of muscarinic receptors as
      well as new spin-off ideas like bitopic ligands combining allosteric and
      orthosteric moieties and photo-switchable ligands based on bitopic agents.

TI  - Etorphine-Azaperone Immobilisation for Translocation of Free-Ranging Masai
      Giraffes (Giraffa Camelopardalis Tippelskirchi): A Pilot Study.
LID - 322
AB  - Simple Summary: Due to their peculiar anatomy and sensitivity to drugs, giraffes 
      are among the most challenging mammals to immobilise. Masai giraffes have
      recently been listed as endangered. Hence, their conservation needs actions that 
      require veterinary capture such as translocations. In this study, we evaluated a 
      new protocol of immobilisation for translocation of free-ranging Masai giraffes. 
      The hypothesis is that, by combining a potent opioid with a tranquiliser, it is
      possible to mitigate the capture stress, which is a major cause of disastrous
      homeostatic consequences, including capture myopathy and death. The combination
      produced, in all individuals, smooth and quick inductions and reliable
      immobilisations. Although hypoxaemia in a few individuals and acidosis were seen,
      the overall cardiorespiratory function was adequate. Whereas the initial stress
      to the capture was limited in the individuals, likely due to tourism-related
      habituation, the opioid-related excitement and resulting increased exertion was
      responsible for worse immobilisation and physiological derangement. A low dose of
      an antagonist was used and evaluated and, in the two-week boma follow-up, it
      proved to be efficient in providing safe recoveries and transport. At the
      investigated doses, the combination provided partially reversed immobilisation
      that allowed uneventful translocation in free-ranging Masai giraffes. Abstract:
      Etorphine-azaperone immobilisation was evaluated for translocation of Masai
      giraffes. Nine giraffes were darted with 0.012 ± 0.001 mg/kg etorphine and 0.07 ±
      0.01 mg/kg azaperone. Once ataxic, giraffes were roped for recumbency and
      restrained manually. Naltrexone (3 mg/mg etorphine) was immediately given
      intravenously to reverse etorphine-related side effects. Protocol evaluation
      included physiological monitoring, blood-gas analyses, anaesthetic times, and
      quality scores (1 = excellent, 4 = poor). Sedation onset and recumbency were
      achieved in 2.6 ± 0.8 and 5.6 ± 1.4 min. Cardio-respiratory function (HR = 70 ±
      16, RR = 32 ± 8, MAP = 132 ± 16) and temperature (37.8 ± 0.5) were stable.
      Arterial gas analysis showed hypoxaemia in some individuals (PaO2 = 67 ± 8 mmHg) 
      and metabolic acidosis (pH = 7.23 ± 0.05, PaCO2 = 34 ± 4 mmHg, HCO3− = 12.9 ± 1.2
      mmol/l). Minor startle response occurred, while higher induction-induced
      excitement correlated to longer inductions, worse restraint, and decreased HCO3−.
      After 19 ± 3.5 min of restraint, giraffes were allowed to stand and were loaded
      onto a chariot. Immobilisations were good and scored 2 (1–3). Inductions and
      recoveries were smooth and scored 1 (1–2). Translocations were uneventful and no 
      complications occurred in 14-days boma follow-up.

TI  - Postoperative delirium after major orthopedic surgery.
PG  - 90-106
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is one of the most common complications 
      in older adult patients undergoing elective surgery. Few studies have compared,
      within the same institution, the type of surgery, risk factors and type of
      anesthesia and analgesia associated with the development of POD. AIM: To
      investigate the following three questions: (1) What is the incidence of POD after
      non-ambulatory orthopedic surgery at a high-volume orthopedic specialty hospital?
      (2) Does surgical procedure influence incidence of POD after non-ambulatory
      orthopedic surgery? And (3) For POD after non-ambulatory orthopedic surgery, what
      are modifiable risk factors? METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted 
      of all non-ambulatory orthopedic surgeries at a single orthopedic specialty
      hospital between 2009 and 2014. Patients under 18 years were excluded from the
      cohort. Patient characteristics and medical history were obtained from electronic
      medical records. Patients with POD were identified using International
      Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes that were not present on
      admission. For incidence analyses, the cohort was grouped into total hip
      arthroplasty (THA), bilateral THA, total knee arthroplasty (TKA), bilateral TKA, 
      spine fusion, other spine procedures, femur/pelvic fracture, and other procedures
      using ICD-9 codes. For descriptive and regression analyses, the cohort was
      grouped, using ICD-9 codes, into THA, TKA, spinal fusions, and all procedures.
      RESULTS: Of 78492 surgical inpatient surgeries, the incidence from 2009 to 2014
      was 1.2% with 959 diagnosed with POD. The incidence of POD was higher in patients
      undergoing spinal fusions (3.3%) than for patients undergoing THA (0.8%); THA
      patients had the lowest incidence. Also, urgent and/or emergent procedures,
      defined by femoral and pelvic fractures, had the highest incidence of POD (7.2%) 
      than all other procedures. General anesthesia was not seen as a significant risk 
      factor for POD for any procedure type; however, IV patient-controlled analgesia
      was a significant risk factor for patients undergoing THA [Odds ratio (OR) =
      1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19 to 3.28, P = 0.008]. Significant risk
      factors for POD included advanced age (for THA, OR = 4.9, 95%CI: 3.0-7.9, P <
      0.001; for TKA, OR = 2.16, 95%CI: 1.58-2.94, P < 0.001), American Society of
      Anesthesiologists score of 3 or higher (for THA, OR = 2.01, 95%CI: 1.33-3.05, P <
      0.001), multiple medical comorbidities, hyponatremia (for THA, OR = 2.36, 95%CI: 
      1.54 to 3.64, P < 0.001), parenteral diazepam (for THA, OR = 5.05, 95%CI:
      1.5-16.97, P = 0.009; for TKA, OR = 4.40, 95%CI: 1.52-12.75, P = 0.007; for spine
      fusion, OR = 2.17, 95%CI: 1.19-3.97, P = 0.01), chronic opioid dependence (for
      THA, OR = 7.11, 95%CI: 3.26-15.51, P < 0.001; for TKA, OR = 2.98, 95%CI:
      1.38-6.41, P = 0.005) and alcohol dependence (for THA, OR = 5.05, 95%CI:
      2.72-9.37, P < 0.001; for TKA, OR = 6.40, 95%CI: 4.00-10.26, P < 0.001; for spine
      fusion, OR = 6.64, 95%CI: 3.72-11.85, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: POD is lower (1.2%)
      than previously reported; likely due to the use of multi-modal regional
      anesthesia and early ambulation. Both fixed and modifiable factors are
      identified.

TI  - Analgesic effects of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil on periprocedural pain
      during percutaneous ablation of renal carcinoma.
PG  - 52-7
AB  - Background: Percutaneous ablation of renal carcinoma is frequently a favourable
      treatment alternative, especially in elderly patients suffering from
      co-morbidities. Also, it is less resource-demanding than conventional surgery of 
      renal carcinoma, and one may, therefore, assume that the incidence of this
      procedure may increase. Analgesia is necessary during this intervention. The aim 
      of this study was to explore the possibility of analgosedation and its relation
      to patient comfort and safety during percutaneous ablation of renal
      carcinoma.Methods: Forty-six patients, sedated with dexmedetomidine and
      remifentanil, supplemented with infiltration anaesthesia (lidocaine 1%),
      underwent percutaneous (radiofrequency or microwave) ablation of renal carcinoma 
      in this prospective study.Results: The patients expected pain intensity around
      the numerical rating score (NRS) 4.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 3.5–5.5), which
      was slightly lower than pain experienced during the procedure NRS 5 (IQR 2–7;
      p = 0.49). Eight percent of the patients needed supplementary morphine during the
      ablation procedure. Sedation score did not differ during ablation, at arrival to 
      or discharge from the recovery ward. Median periprocedural treatment time was
      12 minutes (IQR 12–16). Treatment time did not correlate with experienced pain
      (R2=0.000074, p = 0.96). The median length of stay in the recovery room was
      120 minutes (IQR 84–154). There were seven serious adverse events.Conclusions:
      This proof-of-concept study has shown that analgosedation during percutaneous
      ablation of renal carcinoma can be performed with a generally tolerable degree of
      patient satisfaction. However, pain occurs and should be managed adequately.
      Patient safety must be a major concern for the anaesthetic care.

TI  - Cost comparison among punctate midline myelotomy, intrathecal pain pump, and
      spinal cord epidural stimulator.
LID - 25
AB  - Background:: Invasive pain procedures can be valuable tools to manage chronic
      pain. Here, we compared the costs of three procedures used to address chronic
      pain; punctate midline myelotomy (PMM), placement of a spinal cord stimulator
      (SCS), or placement of an intrathecal pain pump (ITPP). Case Description:: This
      retrospective chart review yielded 9 patients with chronic pain syndromes; 3 had 
      PMM, 3 had SCS, and 3 had ITPP procedures. Variables studied included; pain type,
      the procedures performed, and the cost of each procedure. The Wilcoxon rank-sum
      and one-way analysis of variance were used to compare the three groups (P <
      0.05). PMM was performed for patients with chronic nonmalignant visceral pain and
      SCS was utilized for failed back syndrome, while ITPP was placed in two patients 
      with chronic visceral cancer pain and one patient with chronic somatic cancer
      pain. The mean length of stay was significant shorter for SCS and PMM versus ITPP
      (e.g., 1, 3.6 ± 0.6 and 15 ± 5.6 days). The mean procedure costs were
      significantly higher for SCS versus PMM and ITPP (105,234, $71,087, and $79,333);
      for the latter PMM and ITPP, procedural costs were not significantly different.
      Conclusion:: For the three pain procedures discussed in this report, PMM is the
      most cost-effective as it obviates the need for efficacy trials, and there are:
      no implant device costs, no medication refills, no maintenance costs, and no
      complication management costs.

TI  - Procedural Treatments for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Review of Current Injectable
      Therapies.
LID - 3873098
AB  - Knee osteoarthritis is a common painful degenerative condition affecting the
      aging Canadian population. In addition to pain and disability, osteoarthritis is 
      associated with depression, comorbid conditions such as diabetes, and increased
      caregiver burden. It is predicted to cost the Canadian healthcare system $7.6
      billion dollars by 2031. Despite its high cost and prevalence, controversy
      persists in the medical community regarding optimal therapies to treat knee
      osteoarthritis. A variety of medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories
      and opioids can cause severe side effects with limited benefits. Total knee
      arthroplasty, although a definitive management, comes with risk such as
      postoperative infections, revisions, and chronic pain. Newer injectable therapies
      are gaining attention as alternatives to medications because of a safer side
      effect profile and are much less invasive than a joint replacement. Platelet-rich
      plasma is beginning to replace the more common injectable therapies of
      intra-articular corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid, but larger trials are needed
      to confirm this effect. Small studies have examined prolotherapy and stem cell
      therapy and demonstrate some benefits. Trials involving genicular nerve block
      procedures have been successful. As treatments evolve, injectable therapies may
      offer a safe and effective pathway for patients suffering from knee
      osteoarthritis.

AB  - Background and Aims:: Perineural adjuvants when used as a part of multimodal
      analgesia (MMA) will maximize the quality and duration of analgesia of the nerve 
      blocks. In the present study, we compared the duration of postoperative analgesia
      and other block characteristics of two groups of MMA comprising either perineural
      buprenorphine or dexmedetomidine in the upper limb surgeries performed under
      ultrasound-guided (US-guided) infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks. Material
      and Methods:: A total of 100 adult patients undergoing elective upper limb
      orthopedic surgery under US-guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block were
      randomly divided into two groups. Group I received 150 μg buprenorphine and Group
      II received 50 μg dexmedetomidine, perineurally added to 30 ml of 0.375%
      bupivacaine. Both groups also received tramadol 50 mg IV, dexamethasone 4 mg IV, 
      and diclofenac 75 mg infusion as part of MMA. Both groups were compared for the
      duration of postoperative analgesia, block characteristics, and incidence of
      adverse effects. Results:: The duration of postoperative analgesia was
      significantly prolonged in Group II (937.6 ± 179.1 min vs 1280.4 ± 288.8 min).
      The onset of sensory and motor blocks was shorter in Group II (P < 0.05). The
      duration of sensory and motor blocks was significantly prolonged in Group II (P <
      0.05). The number of rescue analgesics required in the first 24 hours was less in
      Group II (1.98 ± 0.62 vs 0.8 ± 0.64). Although heart rate and blood pressure
      levels were lower in Group II, all patients were hemodynamically stable.
      Conclusion:: For surgeries under brachial plexus block, perineural
      dexmedetomidine when used as a part of MMA provided a prolonged duration of
      postoperative analgesia and improved block characteristics than perineural
      buprenorphine.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of two doses of dexmedetomidine in attenuating the
      hemodynamic response to intubation in patients undergoing elective cardiac
      surgery: A randomized double-blinded study.
PG  - 83-7
AB  - Background and Aims:: Transient tachycardia and hypertension associated with
      laryngoscopy and intubation may be hazardous to patients presenting for cardiac
      surgery. The α 2 agonist dexmedetomidine may blunt this stress response, but the 
      optimal dose which will accomplish this without causing hypotension and
      bradycardia is not well established. The primary objective of this study was to
      compare the efficacy of two doses of dexmedetomidine (0.5 and 1 μg/kg) as a 15
      min infusion in attenuating the hemodynamic stress response to laryngoscopy and
      endotracheal intubation in elective cardiac surgery. Material and Methods::
      Seventy six patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery received a single
      preoperative dose of dexmedetomidine of either 0.5 μg/kg (low dose) or 1 μg/kg
      (high dose) as a 15-min infusion prior to induction. The hemodynamic response to 
      laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation (heart rate, systolic blood pressure,
      mean arterial pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) were recorded at different 
      times. Independent sample t-test, Chi-square test of association, and repeated
      measures analysis of variance were used to analyze the collected data. Results:: 
      The incidence of hypertension following intubation was significantly more in the 
      low-dose group. Administration of 1 μg/kg dexmedetomidine was not accompanied by 
      hypotension or bradycardia. Conclusion:: Dexmedetomidine in a dose of 1 μg/kg is 
      more effective than 0.5 μg/kg for attenuation of hemodynamic stress response to
      intubation in cardiac surgery. A more graded increase in the dose of
      dexmedetomidine may lead to an optimum dose in attenuating the hemodynamic
      response to intubation.

TI  - Pramipexole in peritoneal dialysis patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS): a 
      protocol for a multicentre double-blind randomised controlled trial.
LID - e033815
AB  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sensorimotor 
      disorder among patients with end stage renal disease. This clinical trial aimed
      to provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of pramipexole in patients with
      uremic RLS receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods and analysis: This is a
      12-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial. In total, 104 patients with uremic RLS receiving PD will be enrolled from 
      four hospitals and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either placebo or
      pramipexole. We will determine the efficacy of pramipexole in the improvement of 
      International RLS Study Group Rating Scale as the primary outcome, while
      responder rates for other RLS scales at week 12, change from baseline to week 12 
      for psychological status, sleep disorder and quality of life and blood pressure
      represent the secondary outcomes. Ethics and dissemination: The study was
      approved by the ethics committees of Peking University First Hospital, Xinqiao
      hospital of Army Medical University, Cangzhou Center Hospital and Peking
      University Shenzhen Hospital. The results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed
      journals. Trial registration number: NCT03817554

TI  - Evaluation of clarity of the STOPP/START criteria for clinical applicability in
      prescribing for older people: a quality appraisal study.
LID - e033721
AB  - Objectives: Appropriate prescribing in older people continues to be challenging. 
      Studies still report a high prevalence of inappropriate prescribing in older
      people. To reduce the problem of underprescribing and overprescribing in this
      population, explicit drug optimisation tools like Screening Tool of Older
      Persons’ potentially inappropriate Prescriptions/Screening Tool to Alert to Right
      Treatment (STOPP/START) have been developed. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the clinical applicability of STOPP/START criteria in daily patient care
      by assessing the clarity of singular criteria. Design: Quality appraisal study.
      Methods: For each of the 114 STOPP/START criteria V.2, elements describing the
      action (what/how to do), condition (when to do) and explanation (why to do) were 
      identified. Next, the clarity of these three elements was quantified on a 7-point
      Likert scale using tools provided by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and
      Evaluation (AGREE) Consortium. Primary and secondary outcomes: The primary
      outcome measure was the clarity rating per element, categorised into high
      (>67.7%), moderate (33.3%–67.7%) or low (<33.3%). Secondary, factors that
      positively or negatively affected clarity most were identified. Additionally, the
      nature of the conditions was further classified into five descriptive components:
      disease, sign, symptom, laboratory finding and medication. Results: STOPP
      recommendations had an average clarity rating of 64%, 60% and 69% for actions,
      conditions and explanations, respectively. The average clarity rating in START
      recommendations was 60% and 57% for actions and conditions, respectively. There
      were no statements present to substantiate the prescription of potential
      omissions for the 34 START criteria. Conclusions: Our results show that the
      clarity of the STOPP/START criteria can be improved. For future development of
      explicit drug optimisation tools, such as STOPP/START, our findings identified
      facilitators (high clarity) and barriers (low clarity) that can be used to
      improve the clarity of clinical practice guidelines on a language level and
      therefore enhance clinical applicability.

TI  - High-flow nasal oxygenation versus standard oxygenation for gastrointestinal
      endoscopy with sedation. The prospective multicentre randomised controlled ODEPHI
      study protocol.
LID - e034701
AB  - Introduction: Hypoxaemia is a major complication during gastrointestinal
      endoscopy (GIE) procedures (upper/lower) when performed under deep sedation in
      the procedure room. Standard oxygen therapy (SOT) is used to prevent hypoxaemia. 
      Data suggest that risk factors for hypoxaemia under deep sedation during GIE are 
      obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, a body mass index above 30 kg/m², high blood
      pressure, diabetes, heart disease, age over 60 years old, high American Society
      of Anesthesiologists physical status class and the association of upper and lower
      GIE. High-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) may potentially improve oxygenation
      during GIE under deep sedation. We hypothesised that HFNO could decrease the
      incidence of hypoxaemia in comparison with SOT. Methods and analysis: The ODEPHI 
      (High-flow nasal oxygenation versus standard oxygenation for gastrointestinal
      endoscopy with sedation. The prospective multicentre randomised controlled) study
      is a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing HFNO to SOT during GIE
      (upper and/or lower) under deep sedation administered by anaesthesiologists in
      the procedure room. Three hundred and eighty patients will be randomised with a
      1:1 ratio in two parallel groups.The primary outcome is the occurrence of
      hypoxaemia, defined by a pulse oximetry measurement of peripheral capillary
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) below or equal to 92% during the GIE procedure.
      Secondary outcomes include prolonged hypoxaemia, severe hypoxaemia, need for
      manoeuvres to maintain upper airway patency and other adverse events. Ethics and 
      dissemination: This study has been approved by the ethics committee (CPP Sud Est 
      Paris V, France), and patients are included after informed consent. The results
      will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. As provided for by
      French law, patients participating in the study are informed that they have the
      possibility to ask the investigators, once the study is completed, to be informed
      of the overall results of the study. Thus, a summary of the results will be sent 
      by post to the participants on request. Trial registration number:
      ClinicalTrials.gov Registry (NCT03829293).

TI  - Efficacy and safety of a supplement combination for hand osteoarthritis pain:
      protocol for an internet-based randomised placebo-controlled trial (The RADIANT
      study).
LID - e035672
AB  - Introduction: Hand osteoarthritis (HOA) is a highly prevalent disabling joint
      disease. The current management regimens are limited. Potentially as a
      consequence, many people turn to complementary and alternative medicines for
      symptomatic relief. A combination of two or more supplements is common in
      clinical practice; however, evidence for the efficacy of this approach is
      lacking. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a supplement
      combination for treating symptomatic HOA in comparison to placebo. Methods and
      analysis: The RADIANT study is an internet-based, parallel, superiority,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, two-arm clinical trial. A
      participatory design is used to facilitate the study procedures. One hundred and 
      six participants aged over 40 years with painful HOA and structural change on
      X-ray (Kellgren and Lawrence grade (KLG) ≥2) will be recruited from the community
      and randomly allocated to receive either a supplement combination composed of:
      (1) combined supplement containing Boswellia serrata extract, pine bark extract
      and methylsulfonylmethane and (2) curcumin or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary
      outcome will be 12-week change in hand pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS).
      Main secondary outcomes include adverse events, change in hand function, patient 
      global assessment of disease activity and quality of life. A range of additional 
      measures will be recorded, and an individual patient placebo response will be
      performed. The primary analysis will be conducted using an intention-to-treat
      approach. Adverse events will be monitored weekly throughout the study. Ethics
      and dissemination: This protocol has been approved by the University of Sydney
      Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC No. 2018/766). Dissemination will occur
      through conferences, social media, scientific publications and PhD thesis. Trial

TI  - Experiences of people taking opioid medication for chronic non-malignant pain: a 
      qualitative evidence synthesis using meta-ethnography.
LID - e032988
AB  - Objective: To review qualitative studies on the experience of taking opioid
      medication for chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) or coming off them. Design: This
      is a qualitative evidence synthesis using a seven-step approach from the methods 
      of meta-ethnography. Data sources and eligibility criteria: We searched selected 
      databases—Medline, Embase, AMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
      Literature, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus (Science Citation Index and
      Social Science Citation Index)—for qualitative studies which provide patients’
      views of taking opioid medication for CNMP or of coming off them (June 2017,
      updated September 2018). Data extraction and synthesis: Papers were quality
      appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool, and the
      GRADE-CERQual (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
      working group - Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research)
      guidelines were applied. We identified concepts and iteratively abstracted these 
      concepts into a line of argument. Results: We screened 2994 unique citations and 
      checked 153 full texts, and 31 met our review criteria. We identified five
      themes: (1) reluctant users with little choice; (2) understanding opioids: the
      good and the bad; (3) a therapeutic alliance: not always on the same page; (4)
      stigma: feeling scared and secretive but needing support; and (5) the challenge
      of tapering or withdrawal. A new overarching theme of ‘constantly balancing’
      emerged from the data. Conclusions: People taking opioids were constantly
      balancing tensions, not always wanting to take opioids, and weighing the pros and
      cons of opioids but feeling they had no choice because of the pain. They
      frequently felt stigmatised, were not always ‘on the same page’ as their
      healthcare professional and felt changes in opioid use were often challenging.

TI  - The Surgeon's Role in the Opioid Crisis: A Narrative Review and Call to Action.
LID - 4
AB  - Over the past two decades, there has been a sharp rise in the use of prescription
      opioids. In several countries, most notably the United States, opioid-related
      harm has been deemed a public health crisis. As surgeons are among the most
      prolific prescribers of opioids, growing attention is now being paid to the role 
      that opioids play in surgical care. While opioids may sometimes be necessary to
      provide patients with adequate relief from acute pain after major surgery, the
      impact of opioids on the quality and safety of surgical care calls for greater
      scrutiny. This narrative review summarizes the available evidence on rates of
      persistent postsurgical opioid use and highlights the need to target known risk
      factors for persistent postoperative use before patients present for surgery. We 
      draw attention to the mounting evidence that preoperative opioid exposure places 
      patients at risk of persistent postoperative use, while also contributing to an
      increased risk of several other adverse clinical outcomes. By discussing the
      prevalence of excess opioid prescribing following surgery and highlighting
      significant variations in prescribing practices between countries, we note that
      there is a pressing need to optimize postoperative prescribing practices. Guided 
      by the available evidence, we call for specific actions to be taken to address
      important research gaps and alleviate the harms associated with opioid use among 
      surgical patients.

TI  - Topical Application of Wogonin Provides a Novel Treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis.
LID - 80
AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by inflammatory
      degradation of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Wogonin, a compound
      extracted from the plant Scutellaria baicalensis (colloquially known as
      skullcap), has previously been shown to have direct anti-inflammatory and
      antioxidative properties. We examined the pain-reducing, anti-inflammatory, and
      chondroprotective effects of wogonin when applied as a topical cream. We
      validated the efficacy of delivering wogonin transdermally in a cream using pig
      ear skin in a Franz diffusion system. Using a surgical mouse model, we examined
      the severity and progression of OA with and without the topical application of
      wogonin. Using a running wheel to track activity, we found that mice with wogonin
      treatment were statistically more active than mice receiving vehicle treatment.
      OA progression was analyzed using modified Mankin and OARSI scoring and direct
      quantification of cyst-like lesions at the chondro-osseus junction; in each
      instance we observed a statistically significant attenuation of OA severity among
      mice treated with wogonin compared to the vehicle treatment. Immunohistochemistry
      revealed a significant decrease in protein expression of transforming growth
      factor β1 (TGF-β1), high temperature receptor A1 (HTRA1), matrix metalloprotease 
      13 (MMP-13) and NF-κB in wogonin-treated mice, further bolstering the cartilage
      morphology assessments in the form of a decrease in inflammatory and OA
      biomarkers.

TI  - Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Pain Management: A
      Systematic Narrative Review.
LID - 114
AB  - Recently, clinicians have been using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) for treating various pain conditions. This systematic narrative review
      aimed to examine the use and efficacy of rTMS for controlling various pain
      conditions. A PubMed search was conducted for articles that were published until 
      June 7, 2019 and used rTMS for pain alleviation. The key search phrase for
      identifying potentially relevant articles was (repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation AND pain). The following inclusion criteria were applied for article 
      selection: (1) patients with pain, (2) rTMS was applied for pain management, and 
      (3) follow-up evaluations were performed after rTMS stimulation to assess the
      reduction in pain. Review articles were excluded. Overall, 1,030 potentially
      relevant articles were identified. After reading the titles and abstracts and
      assessing eligibility based on the full-text articles, 106 publications were
      finally included in our analysis. Overall, our findings suggested that rTMS is
      beneficial for treating neuropathic pain of various origins, such as central
      pain, pain from peripheral nerve disorders, fibromyalgia, and migraine. Although 
      data on the use of rTMS for orofacial pain, including trigeminal neuralgia,
      phantom pain, low back pain, myofascial pain syndrome, pelvic pain, and complex
      regional pain syndrome, were promising, there was insufficient evidence to
      determine the efficacy of rTMS for treating these conditions. Therefore, further 
      studies are needed to validate the effects of rTMS on pain relief in these
      conditions. Overall, this review will help guide clinicians in making informed
      decisions regarding whether rTMS is an appropriate option for managing various
      pain conditions.

TI  - Crosstalk Between Kappa Opioid and Dopamine Systems in Compulsive Behaviors.
LID - 57
AB  - The strength of goal-oriented behaviors is regulated by midbrain dopamine
      neurons. Dysfunctions of dopaminergic circuits are observed in drug addiction and
      obsessive-compulsive disorder. Compulsive behavior is a feature that both
      disorders share, which is associated to a heightened dopamine neurotransmission. 
      The activity of midbrain dopamine neurons is principally regulated by the
      homeostatic action of dopamine through D2 receptors (D2R) that decrease the
      firing of neurons as well as dopamine synthesis and release. Dopamine
      transmission is also regulated by heterologous neurotransmitter systems such as
      the kappa opioid system, among others. Much of our current knowledge of the kappa
      opioid system and its influence on dopamine transmission comes from preclinical
      animal models of brain diseases. In 1988, using cerebral microdialysis, it was
      shown that the acute activation of the Kappa Opioid Receptors (KOR) decreases
      synaptic levels of dopamine in the striatum. This inhibitory effect of KOR
      opposes to the facilitating influence of drugs of abuse on dopamine release,
      leading to the proposition of the use of KOR agonists as pharmacological therapy 
      for compulsive drug intake. Surprisingly, 30 years later, KOR antagonists are
      instead proposed to treat drug addiction. What may have happened during these
      years that generated this drastic change of paradigm? The collected evidence
      suggested that the effect of KOR on synaptic dopamine levels is complex,
      depending on the frequency of KOR activation and timing with other incoming
      stimuli to dopamine neurons, as well as sex and species differences. Conversely
      to its acute effect, chronic KOR activation seems to facilitate dopamine
      neurotransmission and dopamine-mediated behaviors. The opposing actions exerted
      by acute versus chronic KOR activation have been associated with an initial
      aversive and a delayed rewarding effect, during the exposure to drugs of abuse.
      Compulsive behaviors induced by repeated activation of D2R are also potentiated
      by the sustained co-activation of KOR, which correlates with decreased synaptic
      levels of dopamine and sensitized D2R. Thus, the time-dependent activation of KOR
      impacts directly on dopamine levels affecting the tuning of motivated behaviors. 
      This review analyzes the contribution of the kappa opioid system to the
      dopaminergic correlates of compulsive behaviors.

TI  - Acute Pancreatitis Due to Disseminated Varicella Zoster Infection in an
      Individual with Newly Diagnosed Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
LID - e7027
AB  - Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection is generally considered as a benign and
      self-limiting disease. However, individuals with VZV infection can have
      disseminated to various organs leading to serious complications, particularly in 
      adults. This pattern is more prevalent in immunosuppressed individuals.
      Disseminated varicella is historically known to involve the central nervous
      system (CNS), liver, and lungs. However, dissemination of varicella to the
      pancreas and subsequently causing acute pancreatitis has been rarely reported.We 
      present a case of disseminated varicella infection in a newly diagnosed human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient causing acute pancreatitis at initial
      disease presentation and subsequently leading to multi organ dysfunction.A
      42-year-old African American female who was initially being treated for
      Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) at an inner-city hospital developed severe
      epigastric pain radiating to back along with nausea on day 2 of admission.
      Physical findings revealed tachycardia, epigastric tenderness and newly formed
      vesicular rash involving the neck and face classical of varicella infection. Skin
      biopsy and serum sample confirmed varicella infection by VZV polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) test. Labs revealed elevated lipase, amylase at a level diagnostic
      of acute pancreatitis. The patient had no other risk factors for pancreatitis.
      She was started on intravenous Acyclovir and intravenous hydration with isotonic 
      normal saline. She was managed conservatively for other systemic complications.
      Pancreatitis resolved after five days of clinical presentation. She completed two
      weeks of Acyclovir, her condition steadily improved and she was successfully
      discharged home with no further recurrence.Acute pancreatitis is a rare
      infectious association of disseminated varicella infection. Clinicians should
      always be mindful of this infectious etiology as one of the rare differentials
      for acute pancreatitis as this is a treatable cause and could prevent morbidity, 
      mortality associated with this condition if treated timely.

TI  - The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Treatment Gap: A National Study of Substance Use 
      Disorder Treatment.
LID - 1178221820904150
AB  - Background:: Anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) use is associated with serious
      mental and physical health problems. Evidence indicates that AAS use among people
      who use psychoactive substances is higher than in the general population. This
      study aims to estimate lifetime AAS use among patients in substance use disorder 
      (SUD) treatment, compare characteristics of AAS and non-AAS users and identify
      whether AAS use was addressed during treatment. Methods:: This cross-sectional
      survey included 563 (142 women, 24.2%) patients in 38 SUD treatment facilities in
      Norway. Respondents reported on AAS and substance use, and treatment experiences.
      Results:: Lifetime AAS use was reported by 156 (28.3%) SUD patients, thereof
      35.6% of the men and 8.0% of the women. Lifetime AAS use was highest among men
      with stimulants (55.8%) as preferred substance, and lowest among men who
      preferred alcohol (14.6%). Initiation of AAS use due to getting thinner following
      substance use was reported by 44.5% of the AAS using men. AAS users reported more
      severe substance use than non-AAS users. More than half (58%) of all patients had
      not been asked about AAS use, and 42.4% of those who were asked, experienced that
      treatment providers lacked expertise about AAS. Conclusion:: Lifetime AAS use in 
      this sample of SUD patients is common practice and comprise an underrecognized
      problem in SUD treatment. Given the deleterious implications to the individual
      and society that concomitant use of AAS may cause, it would be essential to raise
      the awareness about AAS use among SUD patients, and the level of competence among
      health professionals.

TI  - Timing is everything: Early do-not-resuscitate orders in the intensive care unit 
      and patient outcomes.
LID - e0227971
AB  - Background: The use of Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders has increased but many are
      placed late in the dying process. This study is to determine the association
      between the timing of DNR order placement in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
      nurses’ perceptions of patients’ distress and quality of death. Methods: 200 ICU 
      patients and the nurses (n = 83) who took care of them during their last week of 
      life were enrolled from the medical ICU and cardiac care unit of New York
      Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan and the surgical ICU at
      the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Nurses were interviewed about their
      perceptions of the patients’ quality of death using validated measures. Patients 
      were divided into 3 groups—no DNR, early DNR, late DNR placement during the
      patient’s final ICU stay. Logistic regression analyses modeled perceived patient 
      quality of life as a function of timing of DNR order placement. Patient’s
      comorbidities, length of ICU stay, and procedures were also included in the
      model. Results: 59 patients (29.5%) had a DNR placed within 48 hours of ICU
      admission (early DNR), 110 (55%) placed after 48 hours of ICU admission (late
      DNR), and 31 (15.5%) had no DNR order placed. Compared to patients without DNR
      orders, those with an early but not late DNR order placement had significantly
      fewer non-beneficial procedures and lower odds of being rated by nurses as not
      being at peace (Adjusted Odds Ratio namely AOR = 0.30; [CI = 0.09–0.94]), and
      experiencing worst possible death (AOR = 0.31; [CI = 0.1–0.94]) before
      controlling for procedures; and consistent significance in severe suffering (AOR 
      = 0.34; [CI = 0.12–0.96]), and experiencing a severe loss of dignity (AOR = 0.33;
      [CI = 0.12–0.94]), controlling for non-beneficial procedures. Conclusions:
      Placement of DNR orders within the first 48 hours of the terminal ICU admission
      was associated with fewer non-beneficial procedures and less perceived suffering 
      and loss of dignity, lower odds of being not at peace and of having the worst
      possible death.

TI  - National U.S. time-trends in opioid use disorder hospitalizations and associated 
      healthcare utilization and mortality.
LID - e0229174
AB  - Background: The opioid epidemic is a major public health crisis in the U.S.
      Contemporary data on opioid use disorder (OUD) related hospitalizations are
      needed. Our objective was to assess whether OUD hospitalizations and associated
      mortality are increasing over time and examine the factors associated healthcare 
      utilization and mortality. Methods and findings: We examined the rates of OUD
      hospitalizations and associated mortality using the U.S. National Inpatient
      Sample (NIS) data from 1998–2016. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression
      assessed the association of demographic, clinical and hospital characteristics
      with inpatient mortality and healthcare utilization (total hospital charges,
      discharge to a rehabilitation facility, length of hospital stay) during the index
      hospitalization for opioid use disorder. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and
      95% confidence intervals (CI). We estimated 781,767 OUD hospitalizations. The
      rate of OUD hospitalization and associated mortality (/100,000 overall NIS
      hospitalizations) increased from 59.8 and 1.2 in 1998–2000 to 190.7 and 5.9 in
      2015–16, respectively. In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, the following
      factors were associated with worse outcomes; compared to age <34 years, older age
      was associated with higher risk of hospital charges above the median and length
      of stay >3 days, slightly higher risk of discharge to a rehabilitation facility. 
      Higher Deyo-Charlson score was associated with higher hospital charges, length of
      hospital stay, and inpatient mortality. Women had lower odds of inpatient
      mortality than men and blacks had lower odds of mortality than whites.
      Conclusions: Rising OUD hospitalizations from 1998 to 2016 and increasing
      associated inpatient mortality are concerning. Certain groups are at higher risk 
      of poor utilization outcomes and inpatient mortality. Resources and healthcare
      policies need to focus on the high-risk group to reduce mortality and associated 
      utilization.

TI  - Compliance of private pharmacies in Uganda with controlled prescription drugs
      regulations: a mixed-methods study.
LID - 16
AB  - Background: Controlled prescription drug use disorders are a growing global
      health challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. Effective supply chain regulations on
      dispensing and stock control are important for controlling this epidemic. Since
      compliance with these regulations in resource-limited countries is poor, there is
      need to understand its predictors in order to reduce the risk of prescription
      drug use disorders. Methods: A mixed-methods study utilizing a structured
      questionnaire and a simulated client guide was undertaken in Kampala and Mbale
      towns in Uganda. The questionnaire recorded self-reported dispensing and verified
      stock control practices and their covariates from 101 private pharmacies. The
      guide recorded actual dispensing practices from 27 pharmacies. Snowball sampling 
      was done to enrich the sample with pharmacies that stock opioids. The mean
      compliance with good dispensing and stock control practices was calculated.
      Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of 
      compliance. Results: The mean compliance with dispensing and stock control
      requirements was 82.9% and 23%, respectively. Twenty percent and 40% of the
      pharmacies dispensed pethidine without a prescription and with invalid
      prescriptions, respectively. Having a pharmacist on duty (OR = 5.17; p = 0.02),
      prior in-service training on narcotics regulations (OR = 3.51; p = 0.04), and
      previous narcotics audits by the regulator (OR = 5.11; p = 0.01) were independent
      predictors of compliance with stock control requirements. Pharmacies with a
      previous history of poor compliance with dispensing requirements were less likely
      to demonstrate good compliance (OR = 0.21; p = 0.01). Conclusions: There is
      suboptimal compliance to controlled prescription drug regulations among Uganda’s 
      pharmacies. A previous history of poor compliance to dispensing requirements
      predicted low compliance in subsequent assessments. Training and regulatory
      audits increased compliance in stock control but not dispensing. Expansion of
      training and audits to more pharmacies and/or incentives for compliance are
      necessary.

TI  - Metabolomics in Psychiatric Disorders: What We Learn from Animal Models.
LID - 72
AB  - Biomarkers are a recent research target within biological factors of psychiatric 
      disorders. There is growing evidence for deriving biomarkers within psychiatric
      disorders in serum or urine samples in humans, however, few studies have
      investigated this differentiation in brain or cerebral fluid samples in
      psychiatric disorders. As brain samples from humans are only available at
      autopsy, animal models are commonly applied to determine the pathogenesis of
      psychiatric diseases and to test treatment strategies. The aim of this review is 
      to summarize studies on biomarkers in animal models for psychiatric disorders.
      For depression, anxiety and addiction disorders studies, biomarkers in animal
      brains are available. Furthermore, several studies have investigated psychiatric 
      medication, e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants, or mood stabilizers, in
      animals. The most notable changes in biomarkers in depressed animal models were
      related to the glutamate-γ-aminobutyric acid-glutamine-cycle. In anxiety models, 
      alterations in amino acid and energy metabolism (i.e., mitochondrial regulation) 
      were observed. Addicted animals showed several biomarkers according to the
      induced drugs. In summary, animal models provide some direct insights into the
      cellular metabolites that are produced during psychiatric processes. In addition,
      the influence on biomarkers due to short- or long-term medication is a noticeable
      finding. Further studies should combine representative animal models and human
      studies on cerebral fluid to improve insight into mental disorders and advance
      the development of novel treatment strategies.

TI  - Are Larger Litters a Concern for Piglet Survival or An Effectively Manageable
      Trait?
LID - 309
AB  - Simple Summary: In the swine industry, sows are selectively bred for larger
      litters so, theoretically, more pigs can be sold per year. As producers continue 
      to increase the number of piglets born in a litter, it is necessary to review
      problems that can arise in larger litters, and whether these issues can be
      effectively managed and/or require pharmacological intervention. Additionally,
      this review will reflect on whether selecting sows for larger litter sizes is an 
      ethical concern, regardless of how effectively it can be managed. Abstract: As
      sows continue to be selected for greater prolificacy, it is important to review
      problems that arise in larger litters, and whether these issues can be
      appropriately managed. Although a proportion of piglets in larger litters can be 
      born underweight, proper supervision around farrowing and adequate colostrum
      intake has the potential to improve the survival of low-birth-weight piglets and 
      their ongoing growth to weaning. As larger litters can impart greater stress and 
      discomfort on sows, implementing a low-stress environment leading up to
      parturition may improve sow performance and subsequent survival of piglets.
      Additionally, treating sows with anti-inflammatory compounds, either dietary or
      pharmacologically, shows some promise for alleviating sow discomfort and
      improving piglet survival in larger litters. Understanding that selecting sows
      for larger litters not only affects piglet survival but the well-being of the
      sow, the decision to continue selecting for larger litters, regardless of
      management strategies, remains a topic of ethical concern.

TI  - Perceptions and Impact of the 2017 Canadian Guideline for Opioid Therapy and
      Chronic Noncancer Pain: A Cross-Sectional Study of Canadian Physicians.
LID - 8380171
AB  - Background: Physician adherence to guideline recommendations for the use of
      opioids to manage chronic pain is often limited. Objective: In February 2018, we 
      administered a 28-item online survey to explore perceptions of the 2017 Canadian 
      guideline for opioid therapy and chronic noncancer pain and if physicians had
      altered practices in response to recommendations. Results: We invited 34,322
      Canadian physicians to complete our survey, and 1,128 responded for a response
      rate of 3%; 687 respondents indicated they prescribed opioids for noncancer pain 
      and answered survey questions about the guideline and their practice. Almost all 
      were aware of the guideline, 94% had read the document, and 89% endorsed the
      clarity as good or excellent. The majority (86%) felt the guideline was feasible 
      to implement, but 66% highlighted resistance by patients, and 63% the lack of
      access to effective nonopioid treatment as barriers. Thirty-six percent of
      respondents mistakenly believed the guideline recommended mandatory tapering for 
      patients using high-dose opioid therapy (≥90 mg morphine equivalent per day), and
      58% felt they would benefit from support for opioid tapering. Seventy percent of 
      respondents had changed practices to align with guideline recommendations, with
      51% engaging some high-dose patients in opioid tapering and 43% reducing the
      number of new opioid starts. Conclusion: There was high awareness of the 2017
      Canadian opioid guideline among respondents, and preliminary evidence that
      recommendations have changed practice to better align with the evidence. Ongoing 
      education is required to avoid the misunderstanding that opioid tapering is
      mandatory, and research to identify effective strategies to manage chronic
      noncancer pain is urgently needed.

TI  - Network Pharmacology Study on the Pharmacological Mechanism of Cinobufotalin
      Injection against Lung Cancer.
LID - 1246742
AB  - Cinobufotalin injection, extracted from the skin of Chinese giant salamander or
      black sable, has good clinical effect against lung cancer. However, owing to its 
      complex composition, the pharmacological mechanism of cinobufotalin injection has
      not been fully clarified. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of action of 
      cinobufotalin injection against lung cancer using network pharmacology and
      bioinformatics. Compounds of cinobufotalin injection were determined by
      literature retrieval, and potential therapeutic targets of cinobufotalin
      injection were screened from Swiss Target Prediction and STITCH databases.
      Lung-cancer-related genes were summarized from GeneCards, OMIM, and DrugBank
      databases. The pharmacological mechanism of cinobufotalin injection against lung 
      cancer was determined by enrichment analysis of gene ontology and Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and protein-protein interaction network was
      constructed. We identified 23 compounds and 506 potential therapeutic targets of 
      cinobufotalin injection, as well as 70 genes as potential therapeutic targets of 
      cinobufotalin injection in lung cancer by molecular docking. The antilung cancer 
      effect of cinobufotalin injection was shown to involve cell cycle, cell
      proliferation, antiangiogenesis effect, and immune inflammation pathways, such as
      PI3K-Akt, VEGF, and the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In network
      analysis, the hub targets of cinobufotalin injection against lung cancer were
      identified as VEGFA, EGFR, CCND1, CASP3, and AKT1. A network diagram of
      “drug-compounds-target-pathway” was constructed through network pharmacology to
      elucidate the pharmacological mechanism of the antilung cancer effect of
      cinobufotalin injection, which is conducive to guiding clinical medication.

TI  - Open-label placebo treatment of women with premenstrual syndrome: study protocol 
      of a randomised controlled trial.
LID - e032868
AB  - Introduction: Recent evidence suggests that for certain clinical conditions,
      placebos can improve clinical outcomes even without deception. These so-called
      open-label placebos (OLPs) bear the advantage of a significant lower risk of
      adverse events and comply with ethical principles. Although premenstrual syndrome
      (PMS) seems to be considerably susceptible to placebo effects, no study has
      examined open-OLP responses on PMS. Methods and analysis: To test the efficacy of
      OLPs in women suffering from PMS, a clinical randomised controlled trial
      including two OLP study groups (with and without treatment rationale) was
      designed to investigate on the effect on PMS. PMS symptoms are monitored on a
      daily basis via a symptom diary, adverse events are monitored intermittently. The
      study started in spring 2018 and patients will be included until a maximum of 150
      participants are randomised. Besides the primary outcome PMS symptom intensity
      and interference, an array of further variables is assessed. Multilevel modelling
      will be used for data analyses. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was
      obtained from the Ethics Committee Northwest and Central Switzerland. Results of 
      the main analysis and of secondary analyses will be submitted for publication in 
      peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration numbers: (1) ClinicalTrials.gov
      (NCT03547661); (2) Swiss national registration (SNCTP000002809).

TI  - Risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations: a qualitative study of the perspectives of Australian general
      practitioners.
LID - e034363
AB  - Objective: To explore the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) concerning 
      the risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations. Design: A qualitative approach using semistructured telephone
      interviews. Analysis used an integrative approach. Setting: Primary care.
      Participants: Australian GPs with experience of prescribing opioids for people
      with cancer and pain. Results: Twenty-two GPs participated, and three themes
      emerged. Theme 1 (Misuse is not the main problem) contextualised misuse as a
      relatively minor concern compared with pain control and toxicity, and highlighted
      underlying systemic factors, including limitations in continuity of care and
      doctor expertise. Theme 2 (‘A different mindset’ for cancer pain) captured
      participants’ relative comfort in prescribing opioids for pain in cancer versus
      non-cancer contexts, and acknowledgement that compassion and greater perceived
      community acceptance were driving factors, in addition to scientific support for 
      mechanisms and clinical efficacy. Participant attitudes towards prescribing for
      people with cancer versus non-cancer pain differed most when cancer was in the
      palliative phase, when they were unconcerned by misuse. Participants were
      equivocal about the risk–benefit ratio of long-term opioid therapy in the chronic
      phase of cancer, and were reluctant to prescribe for disease-free survivors.
      Theme 3 (‘The question is always, ‘how lazy have you been?’) captured
      participants’ acknowledgement that they sometimes prescribed opioids for cancer
      pain as a default, easier option compared with more holistic pain management.
      Conclusions: Findings highlight the role of specific clinical considerations in
      distinguishing risk of opioid misuse in the cancer versus non-cancer population, 
      rather than diagnosis per se. Further efforts are needed to ensure continuity of 
      care where opioid prescribing is shared. Greater evidence is needed to guide
      opioid prescribing in disease-free survivors and the chronic phase of cancer,
      especially in the context of new treatments for metastatic disease.

TI  - The Modified WHO Analgesic Ladder: Is It Appropriate for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain?
PG  - 411-7
AB  - Introduction: From 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder has
      been used as the simple and valuable pain-relieving guidance in the
      pharmaceutical pain management, however, with the development of medical history,
      notions about pain physiology and pain management have already updated. Is the
      analgesic ladder still appropriate for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) patients?
      This study aims to analyse the current usage of the analgesic ladder in patients 
      with CNCP by evaluating previously published pertinent studies. Methods:
      Literature published in English from January 1980 to April 2019 and cited on
      PubMed database was included. Analysis on the analgesic ladder, current status of
      CNCP management, and a new revised ladder model were developed based on relevant 
      literature. Results: The WHO analgesic ladder for cancer pain is not appropriate 
      for current CNCP management. It is revised into a four-step ladder: the
      integrative therapies being adopted at each step for reducing or even stopping
      the use of opioid analgesics; interventional therapies being considered as step 3
      before upgrading to strong opioids if non-opioids and weak opioids failed in CNCP
      management. Discussion: A simple and valuable guideline in past years, the WHO
      analgesic ladder is inappropriate for the current use of CNCP control. A revised 
      four-step analgesic ladder aligned with integrative medicine principles and
      minimally invasive interventions is recommended for control of CNCP.

TI  - G Protein-Gated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Channel Subunit 3 is Upregulated in
      Rat DRGs and Spinal Cord After Peripheral Nerve Injury.
PG  - 419-29
AB  - Background: G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are
      involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Four GIRK subunits (GIRK1-4)
      are expressed in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). Recently, we have characterized 
      the expression of GIRK1 and −2, and both are downregulated in rat DRGs and spinal
      cord after a complete sciatic nerve transection (axotomy). Here, we aimed to
      study the neurochemical characteristics of GIRK3, and its regulation in rat DRGs 
      and spinal cord induced by nerve injury. Methods: A sciatic nerve axotomy was
      performed to study the influences of injury on GIRK3 expression in DRGs and
      spinal cord. A dorsal root rhizotomy and a sciatic nerve crush were employed to
      study the axonal transport of GIRK3 protein, respectively. Immunohistochemistry
      analysis was employed for investigating the neurochemical characteristics of
      GIRK3. Results: In control DRGs, ~18% of neuron profiles (NPs) were
      GIRK3-positive (+), and ~41%, ~48% and ~45% of GIRK3+ NPs were CGRP+, IB4+ and
      NF200+, respectively. GIRK3-like immunoreactivity was observed in glabrous skin
      of hind paws and axons originating from DRG neurons. Fourteen days after axotomy,
      more than one-third of DRG NPs were GIRK3+, and among these ~51% and ~56%
      coexpressed galanin and neuropeptide Y, respectively. In control animals, a small
      group of interneurons found in the dorsal horn was GIRK3+. In addition, GIRK3+
      processes could be observed in superficial laminae of spinal dorsal horn. After
      nerve injury, the intensity of GIRK3-like immunoreactivity in the superficial
      layers was increased. Evidence based on rhizotomy and sciatic nerve crush
      indicated both anterograde and retrograde transport of GIRK3. Conclusion: Our
      study demonstrates that GIRK3 is expressed in sensory neurons and spinal cord.
      GIRK3 has both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport. GIRK3 expression can 
      be regulated by peripheral nerve injury.

LID - 25
AB  - Introduction: This study analyze factors associated to cannabis use in pregnant
      women, its perceived availability, its risk perception and the relationship
      between prenatal exposure to cannabis and developmental and mental disorders.
      Objectives: We present a review of the literature on cannabis use among pregnant 
      women. The objective is to analyze factors associated to cannabis use during
      pregnancy and assess the potential effects of prenatal exposure to cannabis on
      the development of the fetus and the mental health of those exposed. Methods:
      Systematic review of studies on the maternal use of cannabis and the relationship
      between early exposure and the development of psychiatric disorders in the PubMed
      database until July 2018 in English and Spanish with the following keywords:
      Marijuana, Cannabinoids, Mental disorders, Pregnancy, Prenatal Cannabis Exposure,
      Risk factors. Results: The use of cannabis among pregnant women is frequent but
      it has not been extensively researched. Prenatal exposure to cannabis may be
      associated with affective symptoms and ADHD. Conclusions: Mental healthcare
      professionals who treat women during their fertile life need to be able to
      explain the relationship between prenatal exposure to cannabis and the presence
      of developmental and mental disorders.

TI  - Is marijuana use associated with decreased use of prescription opioids?
      Toxicological findings from two US national samples of drivers.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: State governments in the United States are increasingly viewing
      marijuana legalization as a policy option for controlling the opioid epidemic
      under the premise that marijuana is a less harmful substitute for opioids. The
      purpose of this study is to assess whether marijuana use is associated with
      decreased odds of prescription opioid use. Methods: A cross-sectional study
      design was applied to toxicological testing data from two national samples of
      drivers: 1) the 2011–2016 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and 2) the
      2013–2014 National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers (NRS).
      Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated from
      multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of 
      marijuana use with prescription opioid use and alcohol use. Results: Among the
      47,602 drivers from the FARS, 15.7% tested positive for marijuana and 6.9%
      positive for prescription opioids. Compared with drivers testing negative for
      marijuana, those testing positive for marijuana were 28% more likely to test
      positive for prescription opioids (adjusted OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.15–1.42). Among
      the 7881 drivers from the NRS, 7.9% tested positive for marijuana and 4.5%
      positive for prescription opioids. Relative to drivers testing negative for
      marijuana, those testing positive for marijuana were twice as likely to test
      positive for prescription opioids (adjusted OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.29–3.20). In
      both study samples, marijuana use was associated with significantly increased
      odds of alcohol positivity. Conclusions: Drivers who test positive for marijuana 
      are significantly more likely to test positive for prescription opioids.
      Longitudinal studies with rigorous designs and toxicological testing data are
      needed to further address the substitution hypothesis between marijuana and
      prescription opioids.

AB  - While there has been extensive attention to the ‘demand side’ – or use and
      adverse consequences, including mortality – of the ‘opioid crisis’ presently
      unfolding across North America, few considerations have focused on the supply
      side. This paper examines the supply side dynamics of this unprecedented public
      health phenomenon. We provide evidence for several interrelated supply-side
      elements that have contributed to the present public health crisis. We observe
      that initially, persistently high levels of prescription opioid availability and 
      use exposed large proportions of the North American population to opioids,
      resulting in correspondingly high levels of medical and non-medical use (e.g.,
      involving diversion). While various intervention measures to control prescription
      opioid availability and use have been implemented in recent years, leading to
      eventual reductions in opioid dispensing levels, these occurred late in the
      crisis’s evolution. Moreover, these supply reductions have not been met by
      corresponding reductions in opioid use or demand levels. These growing
      discrepancies between opioid demand and prescription-based sources have left
      major gaps in opioid supplies. In response to such supply gaps, highly potent and
      toxic illicit opioid products have rapidly proliferated across North America, and
      become a core driver of the dramatic spikes in opioid overdose fatality levels in
      recent years. These supply-related interrelations are corroborated by a
      corresponding increase in illicit opioid-related fatalities, which arose just as 
      medical opioid supplies began to decrease in many jurisdictions. Improved
      analyses and understanding of the supply-side dynamics of the opioid crisis are
      urgently needed in order to inform future intervention and policy development.
      Meanwhile, the high mortality toll related to illicit, highly toxic opioid
      exposure requires sustained solutions, including supply-oriented measures (e.g., 
      safer opioid distribution for at–risk users) towards improved public health
      protection.

TI  - Can we identify individuals with an ALPL variant in adults with persistent
      hypophosphatasaemia?
LID - 51
AB  - Background: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inborn error of metabolism characterized
      by low levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Scarce evidence exists about
      features that should signal the potential association between hypophosphatasaemia
      and HPP in adults. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of ALPL
      variants in subjects with persistent hypophosphatasaemia and determine the
      associated clinical and laboratory features. For this cross-sectional study,
      laboratory records of 386,353 subjects were screened by measurement of ALP
      activity. A total of 85 (0.18%) subjects with persistent hypophosphatasaemia (≥2 
      serum alkaline phosphatase–ALP–measurements ≤35 IU/L and none > 45 IU/L) were
      included (secondary causes previously discarded). ALPL genetic testing and a
      systematized questionnaire to retrieve demographic, clinical and laboratory data 
      were performed. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression models were employed
      to identify the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with ALPL
      variants. Results: Forty subjects (47%) had a variant(s) in ALPL. With regard to 
      clinical characteristics, the presence of an ALPL variant was significantly
      associated only with musculoskeletal pain (OR: 7.6; 95% IC: 1.9–30.9).
      Nevertheless, a trend to present more dental abnormalities (OR: 3.6; 95% IC:
      0.9–13.4) was observed. Metatarsal stress fractures were also more frequent (4 vs
      0; p < 0.05) in this group. Regarding laboratory features, median ALP levels were
      lower in subjects with ALPL variants (26 vs 29 IU/L; p < 0.005). Interestingly,
      the threshold of ALP levels < 25 IU/L showed a specificity, positive predictive
      value and positive likelihood ratio of 97.8, 94.4% and 19.8 to detect a positive 
      ALPL test, respectively. Conclusions: In subjects with persistent
      hypophosphatasaemia –secondary causes excluded– one out of two presented ALPL
      variants. Musculoskeletal pain and ALP levels < 25 IU/L are associated with this 
      variant(s). In this scenario, ALP levels < 25 IU/L seem to be very useful to
      identify individuals with the presence of an ALPL variant.

TI  - Focus on Clozapine Withdrawal- and Misuse-Related Cases as Reported to the
      European Medicines Agency (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Database.
LID - 105
AB  - Background: Clozapine is of high clinical relevance for the management of both
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia and psychotic disturbances with concurrent drug
      misuse. Although the molecule presents with a range of well-known side-effects,
      its discontinuation/withdrawal syndrome has been only anecdotally described.
      Aims: the 2005–2018 European Medicines Agency (EMA) dataset of Adverse Drug
      Reactions (ADRs) was analyzed to identify and describe possible clozapine
      withdrawal- and misuse-/abuse-/dependence-related issues. Method: A descriptive
      analysis of clozapine-related ADRs was performed when available, data on ADRs’
      outcome, dosage, and possible concomitant drug(s) were considered. Results: Out
      of 11,847 clozapine-related ADRs, some 599 (5.05%) were related to
      misuse/abuse/dependence/withdrawal issues, including 258 withdrawal-related
      (43.1%); 241 abuse-related (40.2%); and 80 intentional product misuse-related
      (13.3%) ADRs. A small number of overdose- and suicide-related ADRs were reported 
      as well. Clozapine was typically (69.2%) identified alone, and most (84.7%)
      fatalities/high-dosage intake instances were reported in association with a
      history of substance abuse. Conclusions: Previous suggestions about the
      possibility of a clozapine discontinuation/withdrawal occurrence are here
      supported, but further studies are needed. However, the misuse/abuse cases here
      identified might be difficult to interpret, given the lack of studies
      highlighting the possible recreational use of clozapine. The high-dosage intake, 
      fatal outcomes and clozapine/polydrug abuse issues reported here may, however, be
      a reason for concern.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial to investigate the relationship between mild
      hypercapnia and cerebral oxygen saturation in patients undergoing major surgery.
LID - e029159
AB  - Objectives: The effects of hypercapnia on regional cerebral oxygen saturation
      (rSO2) during surgery are unclear. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to 
      investigate the relationship between mild hypercapnia and rSO2. We hypothesised
      that, compared with targeted normocapnia (TN), targeted mild hypercapnia (TMH)
      during major surgery would increase rSO2. Design: A prospective, randomised,
      controlled trial in adult participants undergoing elective major surgery.
      Setting: A single tertiary centre in Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.
      Participants: 40 participants were randomised to either a TMH or TN group (20 to 
      each). Interventions: TMH (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, 
      PaCO2, 45–55 mm Hg) or TN (PaCO2 35–40 mm Hg) was delivered via controlled
      ventilation throughout surgery. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The
      primary endpoint was the absolute difference between the two groups in percentage
      change in rSO2 from baseline to completion of surgery. Secondary endpoints
      included intraoperative pH, bicarbonate concentration, base excess, serum
      potassium concentration, incidence of postoperative delirium and length of stay
      (LOS) in hospital. Results: The absolute difference between the two groups in
      percentage change in rSO2 from the baseline to the completion of surgery was
      19.0% higher in both hemispheres with TMH (p<0.001). On both sides, the
      percentage change in rSO2 was greater in the TMH group than the TN group
      throughout the duration of surgery. The difference between the groups became more
      noticeable over time. Furthermore, postoperative delirium was higher in the TN
      group (risk difference 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5, p=0.02). LOS was similar between
      groups (5 days vs 5 days; p=0.99). Conclusion: TMH was associated with a stable
      increase in rSO2 from the baseline, while TN was associated with a decrease in
      rSO2 in both hemispheres in patients undergoing major surgery. This resulted in a
      clear separation of percentage change in rSO2 from the baseline between TMH and
      TN over time. Our findings provide the rationale for larger studies on TMH during
      surgery. Trial registration number: The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials
      Registry (ACTRN12616000320459).

      colonoscopy.
LID - e000348
AB  - Objective: Although sedation improves patient experience during colonoscopy,
      there is great jurisdictional variability in sedative practices. The objective of
      this study was to develop practice recommendations for the use of moderate and
      deep sedation in routine hospital-based colonoscopy to facilitate standardisation
      of practice. Design: We recruited 32 multidisciplinary panellists to participate 
      in a modified Delphi process to establish consensus-based recommendations for the
      use of sedation in colonoscopy. Panel members participated in a values assessment
      survey followed by two rounds of anonymous online voting on preliminary practice 
      recommendations. An inperson meeting was held between voting rounds to facilitate
      consensus-building. Consensus was defined as >60% agreement/disagreement with
      recommendation statements; >80% agreement/disagreement was considered indicative 
      of strong consensus. Results: Twenty-nine panellists participated in the values
      assessment survey. Panellists ranked all factors presented as important to the
      development of practice recommendations. The factor considered most important was
      patient safety. Patient satisfaction, procedural efficiency, and cost were
      considered less important. Strong consensus was achieved for all nine practice
      recommendations presented to the panel. These recommendations included that all
      endoscopists be able to perform colonoscopy with moderate sedation, that an
      endoscopist and a single trained nurse are sufficient for performing colonoscopy 
      with moderate sedation, and that anaesthesia-provided deep sedation be used for
      select patients. Conclusion: The recommendations presented in this study were
      agreed on by a multidisciplinary group and provide guidance for the use of
      sedation in routine hospital-based colonoscopy. Standardised sedation practices
      will promote safe, effective, and efficient colonoscopy for all patients.

TI  - Impact of Lung Compliance on Neurological Outcome in Patients with Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome Following Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.
LID - 527
AB  - (1) Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following cardiac
      arrest is common and associated with in-hospital mortality. We aim to investigate
      whether lung compliance during targeted temperature management is associated with
      neurological outcome in patients with ARDS after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
      (OHCA). (2) Methods: This observational study is conducted in the emergency
      intensive care unit from January 2011 to April 2019 using data from a prospective
      patient registry. Adult patients (age ≥18 years) who survived non-traumatic OHCA 
      and subsequently developed ARDS based on the Berlin definition are included.
      Mechanical ventilator parameters such as plateau pressure, tidal volume, minute
      ventilation, positive end expiratory pressure, and compliance are recorded for 7 
      days or until death, and categorized as maximum, median, and minimum. The primary
      outcome is a favorable neurological outcome defined as a Cerebral Performance
      Category score of 1 or 2 at hospital discharge. (3) Results: Regarding 246 OHCA
      survivors, 119 (48.4%) patients developed ARDS. A favorable neurologic outcome
      was observed in 23 (19.3%). Patients with a favorable outcome have a
      significantly higher lung compliance (38.6 mL/cm H2O versus 27.5 mL/cm H2O),
      lower inspiratory pressure (12.0 cm H2O versus 16.0 cm H2O), and lower plateau
      pressure (17.0 cm H2O versus 21.0 cm H2O) than those with a poor neurologic
      outcome (all p < 0.01). Concerning time-dependent cox regression models, all
      maximum (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      1.02–1.09), minimum (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03–1.13), and median (HR 1.06, 95% CI
      1.02–1.09) compliances are independently associated with a good neurologic
      outcome. Maximum compliance, >32.5 mL/cm H2O at day 1, has the highest area under
      the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.745) with a positive predictive
      value of 90.4%. (4) Conclusions: Lung compliance may be an early predictor of
      intact neurologic survival in patients with ARDS following cardiac arrest.

TI  - Rapid Naloxone Administration Workshop for Health Care Providers at an Academic
      Medical Center.
LID - 10892
AB  - Introduction: Opioid overdose is a growing problem in the US. Often, residents
      are first responders to community and in-hospital opioid overdoses, and so,
      hands-on naloxone administration education is necessary. While residents get a
      brief algorithm on suspected opioid overdose during their mandatory American
      Heart Association basic life support training, there is a lack of hands-on
      standardized curricula on how to administer this lifesaving medication. Methods: 
      To fill this gap, we developed a hands-on workshop for medical trainees on how to
      respond to an opioid overdose. Trainees who completed our workshop left with a
      first-responder naloxone kit using the Massachusetts statewide open prescription.
      All attendees were asked to take a voluntary pre- and posttraining survey.
      Results: A total of 80 trainees from a variety of specialties and training levels
      participated in this workshop. We were able to successfully link the pre- and
      postdata of 29 participants. Trainees were assessed on comfort in administering
      naloxone as a first responder and in teaching patients how to administer naloxone
      (via a 5-point Likert scale) and on percentage of time they prescribed naloxone
      to high-risk patient populations. We saw statistically significant increases in
      comfort in using naloxone and comfort in teaching patients to administer
      naloxone. Discussion: This innovative curriculum provides an adaptable, short,
      and effective workshop with hands-on practice for medical trainees at a variety
      of training levels. The workshop can efficiently train future health care
      professionals how to approach an opioid overdose.

AB  - Background:: The incidence of anorectal diseases has been increasing year by
      year, and the acupuncture treatment for postoperative pain of anorectal diseases 
      has the excellent therapeutic effect. Currently, there are no relevant articles
      for systematic review. Methods:: We will search the randomized controlled trials 
      related to acupuncture therapy and postoperative anorectal diseases from
      inception to January 2020. The following database is our focus area: PubMed,
      EMBASE, Springer, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane, Controlled Trials Register
      (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), China
      National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan-Fang Database and Chinese
      Scientific Journal Database (VIP database). The primary outcome is the pain of
      visual analogue scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes are the Symptom Checklist,
      Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating (WB) Scale, verbalrating scale (VRS), and 36-Item
      Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scale. We will use Review Manager Software
      (RevMan) V.5.2 for data analysis and quantitative data synthesis. The Cochrane
      collaborative tool will be used to assess the risk of bias in the included
      studies. Results:: Given the available evidence, this study will provide high
      level results for acupuncture therapy in treating postoperative pain of anorectal
      diseases. Conclusion:: The conclusions of this study will provide evidence for
      whether acupuncture is effective in treating postoperative pain of anorectal
      diseases. PROSPERO registration number:: CRD42020150015.

TI  - Ethnopharmacological Applications Targeting Alcohol Abuse: Overview and Outlook.
LID - 1593
AB  - Excessive alcohol consumption is the cause of several diseases and thus is of a
      major concern for society. Worldwide alcohol consumption has increased by many
      folds over the past decades. This urgently calls for intervention and relapse
      counteract measures. Modern pharmacological solutions induce complete alcohol
      self-restraint and prevent relapse, but they have many side effects. Natural
      products are most promising as they cause fewer adverse effects. Here we discuss 
      in detail the medicinal plants used in various traditional/folklore medicine
      systems for targeting alcohol abuse. We also comprehensively describe preclinical
      and clinical studies done on some of these plants along with the possible
      mechanisms of action.

TI  - Survey of Addiction Specialists’ Use of Medications to Treat Alcohol Use
      Disorder.
LID - 47
AB  - Objectives: Several medications have been shown to be safe and effective for
      treating alcohol use disorder (AUD); however, these medications are prescribed
      infrequently. We conducted a survey of the demographics, practice
      characteristics, and self-perceived knowledge, experience, and opinions of
      addiction specialists on the use of AUD medications and how to increase their
      use. Methods: We sent a 19-question survey to members of the American Society of 
      Addiction Medicine (ASAM) and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry
      (AAAP). Results: We received a total of 395 responses from ASAM members and 194
      responses from AAAP members. One hundred of the respondents were members of both 
      organizations. The large majority of respondents (92.6%) were prescribers, and
      81.6% were non-trainee physicians. The two most frequently used medications for
      treating AUD were oral naltrexone (27%) and long-acting naltrexone (18%).
      Respondents were significantly more confident in the strength of the research
      findings and evidence for the efficacy and safety of naltrexone than other AUD
      medications (p < 0.001 ). Respondents identified additional education to current 
      providers about existing medications as the most important potential intervention
      to increase the use of AUD medications. Conclusions: Compared with a survey
      published in 2001, in 2018 the proportion of respondents who reported using
      naltrexone more than doubled and addiction specialists were more confident in
      their use of AUD medications, rating their efficacy and safety more highly.
      Consistent with findings from other recent studies, providing more education to
      practitioners about existing AUD medications may be the most effective way to
      increase their use.

TI  - Are Anticholinergic Medications Associated With Increased Risk of Dementia and
      Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia? A Nationwide 15-Year Follow-Up
      Cohort Study in Taiwan.
LID - 30
AB  - Background/Objective: In previous reports, the usage of anticholinergic
      medications has been associated with an increased risk of dementia with prolonged
      usage or with a high Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB). This study aimed to 
      investigate the association between anticholinergic medications and the risk of
      dementia using data from Taiwan's National Health Research Database (NHIRD).
      Methods: A total of 790,240 patients, with 197,560 patients receiving
      anticholinergic medications and 592,680 control patients (1:3) matched for sex,
      age, and index-year, were enrolled from the two million Longitudinal Health
      Insurance Dataset, a subdataset of the NHIRD, between 2000 and 2015. The
      time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to explore the hazard ratio (HR) 
      with a 95% confidence interval for the association between anticholinergics and
      the risk of dementia during the 15-year follow-up. The behavioral and
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) were recognized by the usage of
      psychotropics. The ACB ranged from zero to three, divided as score <1, 1–1.9,
      2–2.9, 3–4.9,and ≧5. The sensitivity analysis was done by excluding the diagnoses
      of dementia in the first 2 or 4 years after anticholinergic usage. Results: In
      the anticholinergic usage cohort, the HR was 1.043 (95% CI = 0.958-1.212, p =
      0.139) without a significant difference. The sensitivity analysis revealed no
      association between the usage of anticholinergics and the risk of dementia.
      Anticholinergic usage was not associated with BPSD. Male sex, patients of ages of
      60–64 and ≧80, usage of antiparkinsonian medications, a history of Parkinson's
      disease, epilepsy, urinary incontinence, depression, bipolar disorder, and
      psychotic disorder were independent risk factors of dementia. Increased HRs for
      dementia were associated with an ACB ≥ 5 and an anticholinergic usage period ≥
      1,460 days. Conclusion: In this study, the usage of anticholinergics was not
      associated with the risk of dementia or BPSD in a 15-year follow-up study.
      However, patients with the male sex, patients with ages of 65–79 and ≧80,
      patients with some comorbidities, high ACB scores, and long anticholinergic
      treatment duration were associated with the risk of dementia.

TI  - A Review of Scientific Evidence for THC:CBD Oromucosal Spray (Nabiximols) in the 
      Management of Chronic Pain.
PG  - 399-410
AB  - The 20% prevalence of chronic pain in the general population is a major health
      concern given the often profound associated impairment of daily activities,
      employment status, and health-related quality of life in sufferers. Resource
      utilization associated with chronic pain represents an enormous burden for
      healthcare systems. Although analgesia based on the World Health Organization’s
      pain ladder continues to be the mainstay of chronic pain management, aside from
      chronic cancer pain or end-of-life care, prolonged use of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids to manage chronic pain is rarely sustainable. 
      As the endocannabinoid system is known to control pain at peripheral, spinal, and
      supraspinal levels, interest in medical use of cannabis is growing. A proprietary
      blend of cannabis plant extracts containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
      and cannabidiol (CBD) as the principal cannabinoids is formulated as an
      oromucosal spray (USAN name: nabiximols) and standardized to ensure quality,
      consistency and stability. This review examines evidence for THC:CBD oromucosal
      spray (nabiximols) in the management of chronic pain conditions. Cumulative
      evidence from clinical trials and an exploratory analysis of the German Pain
      e-Registry suggests that add-on THC:CBD oromucosal spray (nabiximols) may have a 
      role in managing chronic neuropathic pain, although further precise clinical
      trials are required to draw definitive conclusions.

TI  - MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA IN A CHILD AFTER MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING: A CASE
      REPORT.
LID - e2018267
AB  - Objective:: To report on a case of malignant hyperthermia in a child after a
      magnetic resonance imaging of the skull was performed using sevoflurane
      anesthesia. Case description:: A 3-year-old boy admitted to the pediatric
      intensive care unit after presenting clinical and laboratory findings consistent 
      with unspecified viral meningoencephalitis. While the patient was sedated, a
      magnetic resonance imaging of the skul was performed using propofol followed by
      the administration of sevoflurane through a laryngeal mask in order to continue
      anesthesia. Approximately three hours after the start of the procedure, the
      patient presented persistent tachycardia, tachypnea, generalized muscular
      stiffness and hyperthermia. With a diagnostic hypothesis of malignant
      hyperthermia, dantrolene was then administered, which immediately induced muscle 
      stiffness, tachycardia, tachypnea and reduced body temperature. Comments::
      Malignant hyperthermia is a rare pharmacogenetic syndrome characterized by a
      severe hypermetabolic reaction after the administration of halogenated
      inhalational anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants such as
      succinylcholine, or both. Although it is a potentially fatal disease, the rapid
      administration of continued doses dantrolene has drastically reduced the
      morbidity and mortality of the disease.

TI  - Novel Ocellatin Peptides Mitigate LPS-induced ROS Formation and NF-kB Activation 
      in Microglia and Hippocampal Neurons.
LID - 2696
AB  - Cutaneous secretions of amphibians have bioactive compounds, such as peptides,
      with potential for biotechnological applications. Therefore, this study aimed to 
      determine the primary structure and investigate peptides obtained from the
      cutaneous secretions of the amphibian, Leptodactylus vastus, as a source of
      bioactive molecules. The peptides obtained possessed the amino acid sequences,
      GVVDILKGAAKDLAGH and GVVDILKGAAKDLAGHLASKV, with monoisotopic masses of
      [M + H]± = 1563.8 Da and [M + H]± = 2062.4 Da, respectively. The molecules were
      characterized as peptides of the class of ocellatins and were named as
      Ocellatin-K1(1–16) and Ocellatin-K1(1–21). Functional analysis revealed that
      Ocellatin-K1(1–16) and Ocellatin-K1(1–21) showed weak antibacterial activity.
      However, treatment of mice with these ocellatins reduced the nitrite and
      malondialdehyde content. Moreover, superoxide dismutase enzymatic activity and
      glutathione concentration were increased in the hippocampus of mice. In addition,
      Ocellatin-K1(1–16) and Ocellatin-K1(1–21) were effective in impairing
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and
      NF-kB activation in living microglia. We incubated hippocampal neurons with
      microglial conditioned media treated with LPS and LPS in the presence of
      Ocellatin-K1(1–16) and Ocellatin-K1(1–21) and observed that both peptides reduced
      the oxidative stress in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, these ocellatins
      demonstrated low cytotoxicity towards erythrocytes. These functional properties
      suggest possible to neuromodulatory therapeutic applications.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of postoperative analgesia, cardiorespiratory parameters and 
      changes in liver and renal function tests of paracetamol compared to meloxicam
      and carprofen in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.
LID - e0223697
AB  - Background: In veterinary medicine, the administration of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory analgesics (NSAIDs) for the control of postsurgical pain in
      dogs and cats is common given the anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic
      effects of these drugs. This study compared the serum biochemical changes and
      postoperative analgesic effects of paracetamol, meloxicam, and carprofen in
      bitches submitted to an ovariohysterectomy using the Dynamic Interactive Visual
      Analog Scale (DIVAS) and Pain Scale of the University of Melbourne (UMPS) scoring
      systems. Methods: Thirty bitches of different breeds underwent elective
      ovariohysterectomies and were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups:
      a paracetamol group [15 mg kg-1 intravenous (IV)], a carprofen group (4 mg kg-1
      IV), and a meloxicam group (0.2 mg kg-1 IV). All treatments were administered 30 
      minutes prior to surgery. Paracetamol was administered every 8 hours
      postoperatively for 48 hours total, while carprofen and meloxicam were
      intravenously administered every 24 hours. An evaluation of post-surgical pain
      was done with the DIVAS and the UMPS. The first post-surgical pain measurement
      was performed 1 hour after surgery and then 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and
      48 hours after surgery. Results: All groups exhibited a gradual reduction in pain
      throughout the postoperative period in both scales; however, neither scale
      significantly differed between the three treatment groups (P > 0.05) during the
      48 postoperative hours. Conclusions: Paracetamol was as effective as meloxicam
      and carprofen for post-surgical analgesia in bitches subjected to elective
      ovariohysterectomy. The present study demonstrates that paracetamol may be
      considered a tool for the effective treatment of acute perioperative pain in
      dogs. Furthermore, this drug led to no adverse reactions or changes in the
      parameters assessed in the present study, indicating its safety.

TI  - Clinical Pathways for Oncological Gastrectomy: Are They a Suitable Instrument for
      Process Standardization to Improve Process and Outcome Quality for Patients
      Undergoing Gastrectomy? A Retrospective Cohort Study.
LID - 434
AB  - (1) Background: Oncological gastrectomy requires complex multidisciplinary
      management. Clinical pathways (CPs) can potentially facilitate this task, but
      evidence related to their use in managing oncological gastrectomy is limited.
      This study evaluated the effect of a CP for oncological gastrectomy on process
      and outcome quality. (2) Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing oncological
      gastrectomy before (n = 64) or after (n = 62) the introduction of a CP were
      evaluated. Assessed parameters included catheter and drain management,
      postoperative mobilization, resumption of diet and length of stay. Morbidity,
      mortality, reoperation and readmission rates were used as indicators of outcome
      quality. (3) Results: Enteral nutrition was initiated significantly earlier after
      CP implementation (5.0 vs. 7.0 days, p < 0.0001). Readmission was more frequent
      before CP implementation (7.8% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.05). Incentive spirometer usage
      increased following CP implementation (100% vs. 90.6%, p = 0.11). Mortality,
      morbidity and reoperation rates remained unchanged. (4) Conclusions: After
      implementation of an oncological gastrectomy CP, process quality improved, while 
      indicators of outcome quality such as mortality and reoperation rates remained
      unchanged. CPs are a promising tool to standardize perioperative care for
      oncological gastrectomy.

TI  - Family Planning Practices in Appalachia: Focus Group Perspectives on Service
      Needs in the Context of Regional Substance Abuse.
LID - 1198
AB  - Reproductive health disparities in the Appalachian region may be driven by
      barriers to healthcare access. However, the barriers specific to accessing family
      planning services in Appalachia have not yet been identified from the
      perspectives of Appalachian community members. Moreover, it is unclear how
      community members might perceive elevated levels of opioid use in the region to
      impact family planning practices. To fill this gap in knowledge, the current
      qualitative study explored community perspectives about family planning in
      Appalachia in the context of the opioid epidemic for the purpose of developing a 
      survey instrument based on these responses. We conducted three video call focus
      group interviews with community stakeholders, those who live, work and are
      invested in Appalachia (N = 16), and analyzed the responses using Levesque,
      Harris, and Russell’s (2013) five pillars of healthcare access as a framework to 
      categorize family planning practices and perceptions of service needs in the
      context of regional substance abuse: (1) approachability, (2) acceptability, (3) 
      availability and accommodation, (4) affordability, and (5) appropriateness.
      Subthemes within each of these five categories were also identified. Our findings
      highlight stakeholder concerns around a lack of knowledge about and access to
      family planning services in Appalachia. Community members also expressed concern 
      around the lack of availability of substance use treatment services, which may
      negatively impact family planning use and access in the region.

TI  - Application of Acupuncture to Attenuate Immune Responses and Oxidative Stress in 
      Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction: What Do We Know So Far?
LID - 9641904
AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common sequela following surgery 
      and hospitalization. The prevention and management of POCD are important during
      clinical practice. POCD more commonly affects elderly patients who have undergone
      major surgery and can result in major decline in quality of life for both
      patients and their families. Acupuncture has been suggested as an effective
      intervention for many neurological disorders. In recent years, there are
      increasing interest in the use of acupuncture to prevent and treat POCD. In this 
      review, we summarized the clinical and preclinical evidence of acupuncture on
      POCD using a narrative approach and discussed the potential mechanisms involved. 
      The experimental details and findings of studies were summarized in tables and
      analyzed. Most of the clinical studies suggested that acupuncture before surgery 
      could reduce the incidence of POCD and reduce the levels of systematic
      inflammatory markers. However, their reliability is limited by methodological
      flaws. Animal studies showed that acupuncture reduced cognitive impairment and
      the associated pathology after various types of surgery. It is possible that
      acupuncture modulates inflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic changes, and other
      cellular events to mitigate POCD. In conclusion, acupuncture is a potential
      intervention for POCD. More clinical studies with good research design are
      required to confirm its effectiveness. At the same time, findings from animal
      studies will help reveal the protective mechanisms, in which systematic
      inflammation is likely to play a major role.

TI  - Final Year Nursing Students' Knowledge and Attitudes regarding Children's Pain.
LID - 7283473
AB  - Pain is one of the commonest reasons why children visit the hospital.
      Inadequately treated pain in children can negatively affect their physical,
      psychological, and social well-being; it also places financial burden on families
      of affected children and healthcare systems in general. Considering the eventual 
      suffering of vulnerable children and their families if nursing students are
      insufficiently educated and ill-prepared, the current study aimed at assessing
      final year nursing student's knowledge and attitudes pertaining to pediatric
      pain. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 final year
      undergraduate nursing students at a private university college in Ghana. In
      addition to their ages and gender, the students responded to the 42 individual
      items on the Pediatric Nurses' Knowledge and Attitudes Survey regarding pain
      (PNKAS) instrument. Descriptive statistical analysis was aided by the Statistical
      Package for Social Sciences version 25 software. The mean age of the final year
      nursing students was 29 years (range of 21 to 47 years); a majority of them were 
      females (78%). Participants had an average (SD) correct answer score of 44.0%
      (10.6%). Good pediatric pain knowledge and attitudes were observed in items that 
      were related to the individualized and multidimensional nature of the pain
      experience and its treatment, benefits of pre-emptive analgesia,
      pharmacodynamics, and pain assessment. Poor pediatric pain knowledge and
      attitudes occurred in items that focused on pain perceptions, opioid drug
      administration, useful pain medications, pain physiology, and nonpharmacological 
      pain management interventions. Final year nursing students have insufficient
      knowledge and attitudes toward children's pain management. Areas of good and poor
      pediatric pain knowledge and attitudes should be considered when designing and
      implementing educational interventions on this subject. Curricular revisions
      should be made on existing nursing curriculum to lay more emphasis on children's 
      pain management and use educational interventions that support knowledge
      translation for improved care.

TI  - Quo Vadis PCA? A Review on Current Concepts, Economic Considerations,
      Patient-Related Aspects, and Future Development with respect to
      Patient-Controlled Analgesia.
LID - 9201967
AB  - This review assesses four interrelating aspects of patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA), a long-standing and still widely used concept for postoperative pain
      management. Over the years, anaesthesiologists and patients have appreciated the 
      benefits of PCA alike. The market has seen new technologies leveraging
      noninvasive routes of administration and, thus, further increasing patient and
      staff satisfaction as well as promoting safety aspects. Pharmaceutical research
      focuses on the reduction or avoidance of opioids, side effects, and adverse
      events although influence of these aspects appears to be minor. The importance of
      education is still eminent, and new educational formats are tested to train
      healthcare professionals and patients likewise. New PCA technology can support
      the implementation of efficient processes to reduce workload and human errors;
      however, these new products come with a cost, which is not necessarily reflected 
      through beneficial budget impact or significant improvements in patient outcome. 
      Although first steps have been taken to better recognize the importance of
      postoperative pain management through the introduction of value-based
      reimbursement, in most western countries, PCA is not specifically compensated.
      PCA is still an effective and valued technique for postoperative pain management.
      Although there is identifiable potential for future developments in various
      aspects, this potential has not materialized in new products.

TI  - Factors Affecting Quality of Life and Satisfaction in Patients with Arthritis
      after Change to a Fixed-Dose Naproxen/Esomeprazole Combination Drug.
PG  - 86-93
AB  - Background: In drug therapy for patients with arthritis, a naproxen/esomeprazole 
      combination drug may be a tolerable choice because it can minimize
      gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse effects. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the changes in quality of life (QOL), medication adherence, and
      satisfaction after switch from the existing drug to the combination drug. In
      addition, we analyzed the correlation between the above-mentioned variables and
      the stratified demographic and medical data of the patients. Methods: A
      prospective, noninterventional, observational study was conducted in 30 hospitals
      between May 2014 and July 2016. In total, 2,308 patients with osteoarthritis, 99 
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 76 patients with ankylosing spondylitis
      were enrolled. Demographic information (age, sex, body mass index [BMI], alcohol 
      consumption, and smoking) and medical information (type of arthritis, duration of
      disease, and comorbidities) were collected via a self-administered questionnaire.
      Patients were observed for more than three months after switching to the
      combination drug. Data on the QOL (EuroQoL 5-Dimension questionnaire [EQ-5D
      questionnaire]), medication adherence (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale
      [MMAS]), and satisfaction were collected at the first and last visits. Results: A
      total of 2,483 patients enrolled at 30 hospitals completed the questionnaire.
      After the switch to the combination drug, the mean EQ-5D score improved from 0.72
      ± 0.17 to 0.79 ± 0.14 (p < 0.001), and significant improvement was associated
      with female sex (p = 0.016), shorter disease duration (p < 0.001), and absence of
      comorbidities (p < 0.001). The mean MMAS score was 6.38 ± 1.77, indicating medium
      adherence. Satisfaction was significantly higher in female patients (p < 0.001), 
      in patients with a shorter disease duration (p < 0.001), osteoarthritis (p =
      0.003), and no comorbidities (p < 0.001). Serious drug-related adverse effects
      did not occur. Conclusions: The overall QOL was improved with medium adherence
      after the switch to the combination drug. On the basis of the analysis of
      stratified data, sex, age, drinking, smoking, disease duration, comorbidities,
      and BMI might be associated with QOL, satisfaction, and adherence.

TI  - Management of Restless Legs Syndrome in Pregnancy and Lactation.
LID - 2150132720905950
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects about 20% of all pregnant women. RLS
      symptoms are usually moderate to severe in intensity during pregnancy and can
      result in insomnia, depression, and other adverse outcomes. Although iron
      deficiency has been implicated as a potential etiological factor, other
      mechanisms can also play a role. Nonpharmacologic methods are the primary
      recommended form of treatment for RLS in pregnancy and lactation. Iron
      supplementation may be considered when the serum ferritin is low; however,
      several patients are unable to tolerate iron or have severe symptoms despite oral
      iron replacement. Here, we describe a case of severe RLS in pregnancy and
      illustrate the dilemmas in diagnosis and management. We review the literature on 
      the prevalence, diagnosis, course, possible underlying pathophysiologic
      mechanisms and complications of RLS in pregnancy. We describe current best
      evidence on the efficacy, and safety of nonpharmacologic therapies, oral and
      intravenous iron supplementation, as well as other medication treatments for RLS 
      in pregnancy and lactation. We highlight gaps in the literature and provide a
      practical guide for the clinical management of RLS in pregnancy and during
      breastfeeding.

TI  - Improving sustainable use of genetic resources in biodiversity archives.
LID - e8369
AB  - Tissue sample databases housed in biodiversity archives represent a vast trove of
      genetic resources, and these tissues are often destructively subsampled and
      provided to researchers for DNA extractions and subsequent sequencing. While
      obtaining a sufficient quantity of DNA for downstream applications is vital for
      these researchers, it is also important to preserve tissue resources for future
      use given that the original material is destructively and consumptively sampled
      with each use. It is therefore necessary to develop standardized tissue
      subsampling and loaning procedures to ensure that tissues are being used
      efficiently. In this study, we specifically focus on the efficiency of DNA
      extraction methods by using anuran liver and muscle tissues maintained at a
      biodiversity archive. We conducted a series of experiments to test whether
      current practices involving coarse visual assessments of tissue size are
      effective, how tissue mass correlates with DNA yield and concentration, and
      whether the amount of DNA recovered is correlated with sample age. We found that 
      tissue samples between 2 and 8 mg resulted in the most efficient extractions,
      with tissues at the lower end of this range providing more DNA per unit mass and 
      tissues at the higher end of this range providing more total DNA. Additionally,
      we found no correlation between tissue age and DNA yield. Because we find that
      even very small tissue subsamples tend to yield far more DNA than is required by 
      researchers for modern sequencing applications (including whole genome shotgun
      sequencing), we recommend that biodiversity archives consider dramatically
      improving sustainable use of their archived material by providing researchers
      with set quantities of extracted DNA rather than with the subsampled tissues
      themselves.

LID - 2164956120906092
AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamic brain
      activity following auricular point acupressure (APA) in chemotherapy-induced
      neuropathy (CIN). Methods: Participants received 4 weeks of APA in an open-pilot 
      trial with repeated observation. Along with the clinical self-reported CIN
      outcomes, objective outcomes were measured over the course of the treatment by
      physiological changes in pain sensory thresholds from quantitative sensory
      testing (QST) and repeated functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Results: 
      After 4 weeks of APA, participants had reported clinically significant
      improvements (ie, ≥30%) in a reduction of CIN symptoms (including pain, numbness,
      tingling, and stiffness) in lower extremity stiffness (32%), reduced foot
      sensitivity (13%), and higher pain threshold (13%). Across the 11 intrinsic brain
      networks examined, there was a trend toward significance of the connectivity of
      the basal ganglia network (BGN) to the salience network (SAL), which was
      decreased pre-APA versus immediate-APA (effect size [ES] = 1.04, P = .07). The
      BGN also demonstrated decreased connectivity with the language network pre-APA
      versus delayed imaging post-APA (ES = −0.92, P = .07). Furthermore, there was
      increased executive control network (ECN) and SAL within-network connectivity
      comparing pre-APA to delayed imaging post-APA, trending toward significance
      (ES = 0.41, P = .09 and ES = 0.17, P = .09, respectively). Conclusion: The
      changes in connectivity and activity within or between the ECN, SAL, and BGN from
      pre- to post-APA suggest ongoing alterations in brain functional connectivity
      following APA, particularly in the insula, anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortices, which play significant roles in pain, memory, and cognitive 
      function.

TI  - Integrative East–West Medicine Intervention for Chronic Daily Headache: A Case
      Report and Care Perspective.
LID - 2164956120905817
AB  - Chronic daily headache is a group of headache syndromes including most commonly
      chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache, which often overlap, are
      complicated by medication overuse and are disabling, costly, and variable
      responsive to western pharmacotherapeutic interventions. There is growing
      research and awareness of integrative health approaches and therapies to address 
      patients with chronic headache, yet limited examples of how to deliver this
      approach. This article reviews a commonly seen challenging case of a patient with
      overlapping chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache complicated by
      medication overuse managed with an integrative east–west medicine intervention.
      This included person-centered biopsychosocial history taking, traditional Chinese
      medicine informed acupuncture, trigger point injections, and contributing factors
      modifications. A narrative review of the literature is presented to demonstrate
      an evidence-informed rationale for incorporating nonpharmacologic approaches to
      effectively help reduce the symptom burden of this patient population.

TI  - Effect of Scalp Nerve Block with Ropivacaine on Postoperative Pain in Patients
      Undergoing Craniotomy: A Randomized, Double Blinded Study.
LID - 2529
AB  - Scalp nerve block with ropivacaine has been shown to provide perioperative
      analgesia. However, the best concentration of ropivacaine is still unknown for
      optimal analgesic effects. We performed a prospective study to evaluate the
      effects of scalp nerve block with varied concentration of ropivacaine on
      postoperative pain and intraoperative hemodynamic variables in patients
      undergoing craniotomy under general anesthesia. Eighty-five patients were
      randomly assigned to receive scalp block with either 0.2% ropivacaine, 0.33%
      ropivacaine, 0.5% ropivacaine, or normal saline. Intraoperative hemodynamics and 
      post-operative pain scores at 2, 4, 6, 24 hours postoperatively were recorded. We
      found that scalp blockage with 0.2% and 0.33% ropivacaine provided adequate
      postoperative pain relief up to 2 h, while administration of 0.5% ropivacaine had
      a longer duration of action (up to 4 hour after craniotomy). Scalp nerve block
      with varied concentration of ropivacaine blunted the increase of mean arterial
      pressure in response to noxious stimuli during incision, drilling, and sawing
      skull bone. 0.2% and 0.5% ropivacaine decreased heart rate response to incision
      and drilling. We concluded that scalp block using 0.5% ropivacaine obtain
      preferable postoperative analgesia compared to lower concentrations. And scalp
      block with ropivacaine also reduced hemodynamic fluctuations in craniotomy
      operations.

TI  - Wisdom of the CROUD:  Development and validation of a patient-level prediction
      model for opioid use disorder using population-level claims data.
LID - e0228632
AB  - Objective: Some patients who are given opioids for pain could develop opioid use 
      disorder. If it was possible to identify patients who are at a higher risk of
      opioid use disorder, then clinicians could spend more time educating these
      patients about the risks. We develop and validate a model to predict a person's
      future risk of opioid use disorder at the point before being dispensed their
      first opioid. Methods: A cohort study patient-level prediction using four US
      claims databases with target populations ranging between 343,552 and 384,424
      patients. The outcome was recorded diagnosis of opioid abuse, dependency or
      unspecified drug abuse as a proxy for opioid use disorder from 1 day until 365
      days after the first opioid is dispensed. We trained a regularized logistic
      regression using candidate predictors consisting of demographics and any
      conditions, drugs, procedures or visits prior to the first opioid. We then
      selected the top predictors and created a simple 8 variable score model. Results:
      We estimated the percentage of new users of opioids with reported opioid use
      disorder within a year to range between 0.04%-0.26% across US claims data. We
      developed an 8 variable Calculator of Risk for Opioid Use Disorder (CROUD) score,
      derived from the prediction models to stratify patients into higher and lower
      risk groups. The 8 baseline variables were age 15–29, medical history of
      substance abuse, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, low back pain, renal
      impairment, painful neuropathy and recent ER visit. 1.8% of people were in the
      high risk group for opioid use disorder and had a score > = 23 with the model
      obtaining a sensitivity of 13%, specificity of 98% and PPV of 1.14% for
      predicting opioid use disorder. Conclusions: CROUD could be used by clinicians to
      obtain personalized risk scores. CROUD could be used to further educate those at 
      higher risk and to personalize new opioid dispensing guidelines such as urine
      testing. Due to the high false positive rate, it should not be used for
      contraindication or to restrict utilization.

TI  - The Complex Balance between Analgesic Efficacy, Change of Dose and Safety Profile
      Over Time, in Cancer Patients Treated with Opioids: Providing the Clinicians with
      an Evaluation Tool.
LID - 502
AB  - Background: Scanty data exist on the integration between the analgesic effect of 
      opioids, dose changes, and adverse events in cancer patients. Methods: To provide
      further information on this issue, we analysed data on 498 advanced-stage cancer 
      patients treated with strong opioids. At baseline and three visits (at days 7,
      14, and 21), pain intensity, oral morphine-equivalent daily dose, and the
      prevalence of major adverse events were measured. The proportion of responders
      (pain intensity decrease ≥30% from baseline) and non-responders, as well as of
      patients with low or high dose escalation, was calculated. Results: Pain
      intensity strongly decreased from baseline (pain intensity difference −4.0 at day
      7 and −4.2 at day 21) in responders, while it was quite stable in non-responders 
      (pain intensity difference −0.8 at day 7 and −0.9 at day 21). In low dose
      escalation patients (82.4% at final visit), daily dose changed from 52.3 to 65.3 
      mg; in high dose escalation patients (17.6%), it varied from 94.1 to 146.7 mg.
      Among responders, high dose escalation patients experienced significantly more
      frequent adverse events compared to low or high dose escalation patients, while
      no differences were observed in non-responders. Conclusions: The response to
      opioids results from the combination of three clinical aspects, which are
      strongly interrelated. These results provide some thoughts to help clinical
      evaluations and therapeutic decisions regarding opioid use.

TI  - Bench to Bedside: Animal Models of Radiation Induced Musculoskeletal Toxicity.
LID - 427
AB  - Ionizing radiation is a critical aspect of current cancer therapy. While
      classically mature bone was thought to be relatively radio-resistant, more recent
      data have shown this to not be the case. Radiation therapy (RT)-induced bone loss
      leading to fracture is a source of substantial morbidity. The mechanisms of RT
      likely involve multiple pathways, including changes in angiogenesis and bone
      vasculature, osteoblast damage/suppression, and increased osteoclast activity.
      The majority of bone loss appears to occur rapidly after exposure to ionizing RT,
      with significant changes in cortical thickness being detectable on computed
      tomography (CT) within three to four months. Additionally, there is a
      dose–response relationship. Cortical thinning is especially notable in areas of
      bone that receive >40 gray (Gy). Methods to mitigate toxicity due to RT-induced
      bone loss is an area of active investigation. There is an accruing clinical trial
      investigating the use of risderonate, a bisphosphonate, to prevent rib bone loss 
      in patients undergoing lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
      Additionally, several other promising therapeutic/preventative approaches are
      being explored in preclinical studies, including parathyroid hormone (PTH),
      amifostine, and mechanical loading of irradiated bones.

TI  - Discovery of Kynurenines Containing Oligopeptides as Potent Opioid Receptor
      Agonists.
LID - 284
AB  - Kynurenine (kyn) and kynurenic acid (kyna) are well-defined metabolites of
      tryptophan catabolism collectively known as “kynurenines”, which exert regulatory
      functions in host-microbiome signaling, immune cell response, and neuronal
      excitability. Kynurenine containing peptides endowed with opioid receptor
      activity have been isolated from natural organisms; thus, in this work, novel
      opioid peptide analogs incorporating L-kynurenine (L-kyn) and kynurenic acid
      (kyna) in place of native amino acids have been designed and synthesized with the
      aim to investigate the biological effect of these modifications. The
      kyna-containing peptide (KA1) binds selectively the μ-opioid receptor with a Ki =
      1.08 ± 0.26 (selectivity ratio μ/δ/κ = 1:514:10,000), while the L-kyn-containing 
      peptide (K6) shows a mixed binding affinity for μ, δ, and κ-opioid receptors,
      with efficacy and potency (Emax = 209.7 + 3.4%; LogEC50 = −5.984 + 0.054) higher 
      than those of the reference compound DAMGO. This novel oligopeptide exhibits a
      strong antinociceptive effect after i.c.v. and s.c. administrations in in vivo
      tests, according to good stability in human plasma (t1/2 = 47 min).

TI  - Methanol Extract of Dicranopteris linearis Leaves Attenuate Pain via the
      Modulation of Opioid/NO-Mediated Pathway.
LID - 280
AB  - Dicranopteris linearis leaf has been reported to exert antinociceptive activity. 
      The present study elucidates the possible mechanisms of antinociception modulated
      by the methanol extract of D. linearis leaves (MEDL) using various mouse models. 
      The extract (25, 150, and 300 mg/kg) was administered orally to mice for 30 min
      priot to subjection to the acetic acid-induced writhing-, hot plate- or
      formalin-test to establish the antinociceptive profile of MEDL. The most
      effective dose was then used in the elucidation of possible mechanisms of action 
      stage. The extract was also subjected to the phytochemical analyses. The results 
      confirmed that MEDL exerted significant (p < 0.05) antinociceptive activity in
      those pain models as well as the capsaicin-, glutamate-, bradykinin- and phorbol 
      12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced paw licking model. Pretreatment with
      naloxone (a non-selective opioid antagonist) significantly (p < 0.05) reversed
      MEDL effect on thermal nociception. Only l-arginine (a nitric oxide (NO) donor)
      but not N(ω)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME; a NO inhibitor) or
      1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; a specific soluble guanylyl
      cyclase inhibitor) significantly (p < 0.05) modified MEDL effect on the writhing 
      test. Several polyphenolics and volatile antinociceptive compounds were detected 
      in MEDL. In conclusion, MEDL exerted the opioid/NO-mediated antinociceptive
      activity, thus, justify D. linearis as a potential source for new analgesic
      agents development.

TI  - Nerve Block for Septorhinoplasty: A Retrospective Observational Study of
      Postoperative Complications in 24 Hours.
LID - e6961
AB  - Septorhinoplasty is a surgical procedure that provides functional improvements
      and esthetic adjustments to the appearance of the nose. Pain is a common
      postoperative complication, and pain management is known to decrease
      postoperative complications and total cost. Local anesthetics can
      cost-effectively decrease postoperative pain scores and reduce analgesic
      requirements.The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of
      bilateral facial nerve blocks given with general anesthesia on pain scores and
      the use of postoperative analgesia. The secondary objective was to compare the
      vital signs stability between a group given bilateral facial nerve blocks with
      general anesthesia and a group given general anesthesia only.We conducted a
      retrospective observational study among 40 patients who were divided into two
      groups, each containing 20 patients. The patients in the nerve block (NB) group
      received general anesthesia and bilateral facial blocks of the infraorbital and
      infratrochlear nerves via 5 ml of 0.25% levobupivacaine with 5 ml of diluted
      adrenaline 1:100,000. Patients in the Control group received general anesthesia
      only. Both groups received the same local injection of a mixture of 5 ml of 1%
      lidocaine and 5 ml of 1:100,000 epinephrine at the surgical site, along with the 
      standard general anesthesia. A numerical rating scale, the visual analog scale
      (VAS), was used to evaluate postoperative pain at 15, 30, and 45 minutes
      postoperatively, and the stability of the vital signs was also assessed.The
      results showed that using bilateral infraorbital and infratrochlear nerve block
      injection with 0.25% levobupivacaine for patients who underwent septorhinoplasty 
      under general anesthesia provided greater stability of vital signs but had no
      effect on the pain score or analgesia need. Further assessment should be
      performed in a larger number of patients to either confirm or refute these
      results. Additional studies could be conducted in several hospitals within the
      Kingdom to determine how broadly applicable nerve blockade is in reducing pain
      sensation.

TI  - School-based interventions for preventing substance use in indigenous children
      ages 7–13: a scoping review protocol.
LID - e034032
AB  - Introduction: Throughout the world, indigenous peoples share traumatic colonial
      experiences that have caused gross inequalities for them and continue to impact
      every aspect of their lives. The effect of intergenerational trauma and other
      health disparities have been remarkable for Indigenous children and adolescents, 
      who are at a greater risk of adverse mental health and addiction outcomes
      compared with non-indigenous people of the same age. Most indigenous children are
      exposed to addictive substances at an early age, which often leads to early
      initiation of substance use and is associated with subsequent physical and mental
      health issues, poor social and relational functioning, and occupational and legal
      problems. The aim of this paper is to report the protocol for the scoping review 
      of school-based interventions for substance use prevention in Indigenous children
      ages 7–13 living in Canada, the USA, Australia and New Zealand. This scoping
      review seeks to answer the following questions: (1) What is known about
      indigenous school-based interventions for preventing substance use and (2) What
      are the characteristics and outcomes of school-based interventions for preventing
      substance use? Methods and analysis: This scoping review will use steps described
      by Arksey and O’Malley and Levac: (1) identifying the research question(s); (2)
      identifying relevant studies; (3) selecting the studies; (4) charting the data;
      (5) collating, summarising and reporting the results and (6) consulting with
      experts. Our findings will be reported according to the guidelines set by the
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
      Scoping Reviews. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics review approval is not required
      for this project. Findings from this study will be presented to lay public, at
      scientific conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

TI  - Modeling Learning Patterns to Predict Placebo Analgesic Effects in Healthy and
      Chronic Orofacial Pain Participants.
LID - 39
AB  - Successfully predicting the susceptibility of individuals to placebo analgesics
      will aid in developing more effective pain medication and therapies, as well as
      aiding potential future clinical use of placebos. In pursuit of this goal, we
      analyzed healthy and chronic pain patients' patterns of responsiveness during
      conditioning rounds and their links to conditioned placebo analgesia and the
      mediating effect of expectation on those responses. We recruited 579 participants
      (380 healthy, 199 with temporomandibular disorder [TMD]) to participate in a
      laboratory placebo experiment. Individual pain sensitivity dictated the
      temperatures used for high- and low-pain stimuli, paired with red or green
      screens, respectively, and participants were told there would be an analgesic
      intervention paired with the green screens. Over two conditioning sessions and
      one testing session, participants rated the painfulness of each stimulus on a
      visual analogue scale from 0 to 100. During the testing phase, the same
      temperature was used for both red and green screens to assess responses to the
      placebo effect, which was defined as the difference between the average of the
      high-pain-cue stimuli and low-pain-cue stimuli. Delta scores, defined as each
      low-pain rating subtracted from its corresponding high-pain rating, served as a
      means of modeling patterns of conditioning strength and placebo responsiveness.
      Latent class analysis (LCA) was then conducted to classify the participants based
      on the trajectories of the delta values during the conditioning rounds. Classes
      characterized by persistently greater or increasing delta scores during
      conditioning displayed greater placebo analgesia during testing than those with
      persistently lower or decreasing delta scores. Furthermore, the identified
      groups' expectation of pain relief acted as a mediator for individual placebo
      analgesic effects. This study is the first to use LCA to discern the relationship
      between patterns of learning and the resultant placebo analgesia in chronic pain 
      patients. In clinical settings, this knowledge can be used to enhance clinical
      pain outcomes, as chronic pain patients with greater prior experiences of pain
      reduction may benefit more from placebo analgesia.

TI  - Connectivity Patterns of Subthalamic Stimulation Influence Pain Outcomes in
      Parkinson's Disease.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: Pain is highly prevalent in Parkinson's disease and is associated
      with significant reduction in health-related quality of life. Subthalamic deep
      brain stimulation can produce significant pain relief in a subset of patients
      after surgery. However, the mechanism by which deep brain stimulation modulates
      sensory function in Parkinson's disease remains uncertain.Objective: To describe 
      the motor and pain outcomes of deep brain stimulation applied to a series of
      patients with Parkinson's disease and to determine whether the structural
      connectivity between the volume of tissue activated and different regions of the 
      brain was associated with the changes of these outcomes after surgery.Methods:
      Data from a long-term prospective cohort of 32 Parkinson's disease patients with 
      subthalamic stimulation were combined with available human connectome to identify
      connections consistently associated with clinical improvement (Unified Parkinson 
      Disease Rating Scale), pain intensity, and experimental cold pain threshold after
      surgery.Results: The connectivity between the volume of tissue activated and a
      distributed network of sensory brain regions (prefrontal, insular and cingulate
      cortex, and postcentral gyrus) was inversely correlated with pain intensity
      improvement and reduced sensitivity to cold pain after surgery (p < 0.01). The
      connectivity strength with the supplementary motor area positively correlated
      with motor and pain threshold improvement (p < 0.05).Conclusions: These data
      suggest that the pattern of the connectivity between the region stimulated and
      specific brain cortical area might be responsible, in part, for the successful
      control of motor and pain symptoms by subthalamic deep brain stimulation in
      Parkinson's disease.

      Post-Surgical Pain After Thoracoscopic Surgeries: A Randomized Controlled,
      Factorial Design, International, Multicenter Pilot Trial.
PG  - 377-87
AB  - Purpose: We conducted a feasibility 2×2 factorial trial comparing
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists (intravenous ketamine and oral memantine)
      versus placebo and intravenous steroids versus placebo, in patients having
      elective video-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomies, at St. Joseph’s Hamilton,
      Canada, and Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA. Our feasibility objectives were: 1)
      recruitment rate/week; 2) recruitment of ≥90% of eligible patients; and 3) >90%
      follow-up. Secondary objectives were incidence and intensity of persistent
      post-surgical pain (PPSP) and other clinical and safety outcomes. Methods: Using 
      computerized randomization, patients were allocated to one of four groups: NMDA
      active with steroid placebo; NMDA placebo with steroid active; both NMDA and
      steroid active; both NMDA and steroid placebo. Patients, health providers, and
      data analysts were blinded to allocation. Patients were followed for 3 months
      after randomization. Results: The trial was initiated in May 2017 at Hamilton
      and, after subsequent regulatory and ethics approval, in April 2018 at Cleveland.
      The trial had to be stopped after only 1 month of recruitment in Cleveland
      because the packaged study medications (memantine) expired and we were unable to 
      procure the dosage required. Among 41 eligible patients, 27 (66%) were
      randomized. The recruitment rate/week was 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI):
      0.47–0.79 in Hamilton; and 1, 95% CI: 0.83–1.17 in Cleveland. Follow-up was
      complete for all 24 patients (100%) in Hamilton, and 3 of 4 patients in
      Cleveland. In total, only 4 patients (15%), and 2 patients (7%) had persistent
      pain at rest and with movement, respectively. There were no significant
      differences between groups for other outcomes. Conclusion: The trial had to be
      stopped prematurely due to non-availability of study medications. Trial
      feasibility objectives of recruiting 90% of eligible patients and recruiting at
      least one patient/week per site were not met. Consideration for protocol changes 
      will be necessary for the full trial. Trial Registration: NCT02950233.

PG  - 1069-78
AB  - Purpose: Hangeshashinto (TJ-14), a Kampo medicine comprising seven types of
      herbs, has been used in Japan to alleviate the side effects associated with
      anticancer drug treatments. However, the pharmacological effects of this medicine
      currently remain unclear. The present study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of 
      TJ-14 against anticancer drug-induced stomatitis, the pain associated with which 
      may have a negative impact on mastication and swallowing. Methods: Mucositis was 
      induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by cancer chemotherapy. Changes in body weight,
      stomatitis grades, histopathological scores, and oral bacterial counts were
      examined among TJ-14-treated, saline-treated, and Control (no treatment) rats. In
      vitro studies, including cell proliferation and wound healing assays, using
      epidermal keratinocyte and fibroblast cell lines were conducted. Results: The
      local application of TJ-14 exerted strong antibacterial effects and attenuated
      oral chemotherapy-induced stomatitis in rats. TJ-14 also increased the viability 
      and invasion of epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Conclusion: The present 
      results demonstrated the potential of TJ-14 to attenuate chemotherapy-induced
      stomatitis.

      arthroplasty: a retrospective review.
LID - 48
AB  - Background: Stiffness and pain from arthrofibrosis following total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) is a challenging problem, and investigating methods to prevent
      or reduce the incidence of postoperative arthrofibrosis is critical. Studies have
      shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin
      receptor blockers (ARBs) are efficacious at preventing fibrotic disorders in the 
      lungs, liver, kidneys, and eyes. Our aim was to determine if ACEI or ARB use
      postoperatively reduces the incidence of arthrofibrosis in TKA patients. Methods:
      In a retrospective review, we analyzed 141 consecutive TKAs performed at a single
      institution by a single surgeon from December 2010 to December 2014. Range of
      motion (ROM) in patients already taking ACEI, ARB, or neither medication was
      compared. Independent variables recorded were gender, age, BMI, presence of
      diabetes or preoperative opioid or statin use, preoperative ROM, and use of ACEIs
      or ARBs. Dependent variables recorded were postoperative knee flexion, extension,
      and total arc of motion. The primary outcome variable was success or failure of
      achieving 118o total arc of motion postoperatively, based on a study that found
      significant compromise of function in TKA patients who failed to obtain this
      goal. Secondary endpoints were postoperative knee flexion, extension, and total
      arc of motion. Results: The use of neither ACEIs nor ARBs showed a significant
      difference in attaining greater than 118° of motion postoperatively compared to
      controls at 6 months. Significant predictors of obtaining > 118° motion were BMI 
      (p < 0.05), preoperative flexion (p < 0.001), and preoperative total arc of
      motion (p < 0.002). Significant predictors of secondary ROM outcomes were
      preoperative ROM and BMI. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the principle 
      predictor of postoperative ROM is BMI and preoperative ROM. The use of ACEIs or
      ARBs did not result in a greater likelihood of obtaining satisfactory ROM
      postoperatively.

TI  - Effects of sevoflurane and desflurane on the nociceptive responses of substantia 
      gelatinosa neurons in the rat spinal cord dorsal horn: An in vivo patch-clamp
      analysis.
LID - 1744806920903149
AB  - Background: Volatile anesthetics suppress noxiously evoked activity in the spinal
      dorsal horn, which could contribute in part to analgesia, immobility. Modulation 
      of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in substantia gelatinosa
      neurons could lead to the suppression of dorsal horn activity; however, this
      phenomenon has not yet been investigated fully. Methods: In urethane-anesthetized
      rats, extracellular activity of dorsal horn neurons (action potentials) and
      excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents in substantia gelatinosa neurons were
      recorded using extracellular and in vivo patch-clamp techniques, respectively, to
      assess the spontaneous and the noxious-evoked activity. Sevoflurane or desflurane
      at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 minimum alveolar concentration was
      administered by inhalation. Hot- and cold-plate tests were performed to assess
      nociceptive responses during the inhalation of volatile anesthetics at lower
      anesthetic doses (0.1–0.5 minimum alveolar concentration). Results: At anesthetic
      doses (1 and 2 minimum alveolar concentration), both sevoflurane and desflurane
      decreased the frequency of action potentials in the dorsal horn and the
      activities of excitatory postsynaptic currents in substantia gelatinosa neurons
      during pinch stimulation and decreased the activities of spontaneous and
      miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Inhibition of the frequencies was
      more prominent than that of amplitudes in spontaneous and miniature excitatory
      postsynaptic currents at these anesthetic doses. However, at subanesthetic doses 
      (0.1 and 0.2 minimum alveolar concentration), desflurane facilitated action
      potentials and excitatory postsynaptic currents. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents
      were inhibited by both anesthetics at anesthetic doses (1 and 2 minimum alveolar 
      concentration). Hot- or cold-plate tests showed hyperalgesic effects of
      desflurane at subanesthetic doses (0.1 and 0.2 minimum alveolar concentration)
      and a dose-dependent analgesic effect of sevoflurane. Conclusions: Sevoflurane
      and desflurane at anesthetic doses suppressed dorsal horn activity mainly via
      inhibition of excitatory postsynaptic currents in substantia gelatinosa neurons, 
      which would contribute to their analgesic properties. Presynaptic mechanisms were
      likely in excitatory postsynaptic currents inhibition. Desflurane but not
      sevoflurane may have a hyperalgesic effect at subanesthetic doses.

      last decade. This report describes a case of 43-year-old female with a traumatic 
      brain injury who developed chronic pain and opioid dependence. The patient
      expressed concerns and wanted weaning off opioids. Recent legalization of medical
      marijuana in Pennsylvania allows us to try it as an alternative to opioids for
      chronic pain. Medical cannibus has risks associated with administration but is
      safer than opioids. Our patient was successfully weaned off her opioid
      medications with the help of medical cannibus and pain remained well controlled. 
      More studies need to be done on using medical cannibus as an alternative to
      opioids.

TI  - Chronic Non-cancer Pain Management and Addiction: A Review.
LID - e6963
AB  - The use of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) has been a fast-rising
      treatment phenomenon in the last two decades. Though opioids are advocated in
      various chronic pain management guidelines, their use in chronic non-cancer pain 
      still remains controversial as evidence of this approach is still weak. This
      paper highlights potential adverse effects associated with opioid use in pain
      management, including an increase in tolerance, dependence, and addiction
      outcomes. Nonetheless, opioids have an important place in contemporary CNCP
      management for selected patients. However, pain management must involve regular
      monitoring and the use of a multimodal pain management strategy. It is essential 
      that the treating physician must be up-to-date with the form of therapy so that
      they have the requisite confidence to prescribe opioids and effectively manage
      adverse effects. Moreover, the adverse effects should be treated promptly to
      enhance patient compliance. Since this approach is beneficial for some patients, 
      opioid treatment should only be applied on a case by case basis.

TI  - Prescription drug diversion, misuse, and abuse among people living with HIV: a
      scoping review protocol.
LID - 29
AB  - Background: Prescription drugs are controlled medicines due to their potential
      risks of being diverted, misused, and abused. Since the introduction of
      antiretroviral (ARVs) drugs, HIV is currently regarded as a chronic condition.
      However, prescription drug diversion, misuse, and abuse might serve as one of the
      critical barriers for achieving optimal medication adherence among people living 
      with HIV, thereby negatively impacting the HIV care mandate. The primary aim of
      this scoping review is to gather evidence on the prevalence, practices, risk
      factors, and motives associated with prescription drug diversion, misuse, and
      abuse, as well as the evidence on the association between prescription drug
      diversion, misuse, and abuse with antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence.
      Methods: This review will be guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s framework as well as
      recommendations by Levac et al. (Implement Sci 5:69, 2010). We will search the
      following databases for relevant literature meeting our eligibility criteria:
      PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCOhost (Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, and
      Newspaper Source), World Health Organization, Science Direct, and Open Access
      Theses and Dissertations. Studies published within the period of January 1996 to 
      June 2019 are eligible. The included studies should report evidence on the
      prevalence, practices, risk factors, motives, or association between ART
      adherence and prescription drug diversion, misuse, and abuse. Thematic analysis
      will be applied to summarize the review findings. Discussion: We anticipate
      finding a considerable number of research studies on prescription drug diversion,
      misuse, and abuse among people living with HIV. Our synthesis of this evidence
      base is intended to serve as guidance for future research studies. The study
      findings will be disseminated through the traditional academic platforms, such as
      peer-reviewed publications and presentations at relevant local and international 
      conferences, symposiums, and seminars. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO

TI  - Prospects for finding the mechanisms of sex differences in addiction with human
      and model organism genetic analysis.
LID - e12645
AB  - Despite substantial evidence for sex differences in addiction epidemiology,
      addiction‐relevant behaviors and associated neurobiological phenomena, the
      mechanisms and implications of these differences remain unknown. Genetic analysis
      in model organism is a potentially powerful and effective means of discovering
      the mechanisms that underlie sex differences in addiction. Human genetic studies 
      are beginning to show precise risk variants that influence the mechanisms of
      addiction but typically lack sufficient power or neurobiological mechanistic
      access, particularly for the discovery of the mechanisms that underlie sex
      differences. Our thesis in this review is that genetic variation in model
      organisms are a promising approach that can complement these investigations to
      show the biological mechanisms that underlie sex differences in addiction.

      Ventral Pallidum.
PG  - 2018-2027.e3
AB  - Projections from the nucleus accumbens to the ventral pallidum (VP) regulate
      relapse in animal models of addiction. The VP contains GABAergic (VPGABA) and
      glutamatergic (VPGlu) neurons, and a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons
      co-express enkephalin (VPPenk). Rabies tracing reveals that VPGlu and VPPenk
      neurons receive preferential innervation from upstream D1- relative to
      D2-expressing accumbens neurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of VPGlu neurons
      inhibits, whereas stimulation of VPGABA and VPPenk neurons potentiates cocaine
      seeking in mice withdrawn from intravenous cocaine self-administration. Calcium
      imaging reveals cell type-specific activity patterns when animals learn to
      suppress drug seeking during extinction training versus engaging in cue-induced
      cocaine seeking. During cued seeking, VPGABA neurons increase their overall
      activity, and VPPenk neurons are selectively activated around nose pokes for
      cocaine. In contrast, VPGlu neurons increase their spike rate following
      extinction training. These data show that VP subpopulations differentially encode
      and regulate cocaine seeking, with VPPenk and VPGABA neurons facilitating and
      VPGlu neurons inhibiting cocaine seeking.

TI  - Neighborhood built and social environment and meeting physical activity
      recommendations among mid to older adults with joint pain.
LID - 101063
AB  - Arthritis is a leading cause of disability in the United States, with the most
      efficacious treatments being physical activity (PA). Arthritis patients are less 
      likely to meet PA recommendations and the neighborhood environment may play a
      role. This study examines the effect of neighborhood walkability and social
      cohesion on PA among arthritis patients in a sample of US adults. This
      cross-sectional study used 2015 National Health Interview Survey data. Eligible
      participants were age ≥45 years, had arthritis, recent leg-joint pain and
      complete data. Walkability was based on 6 questions regarding amenities and
      destinations that promote walking. Social cohesion was based on 4 validated
      questions. Meeting PA was defined as 150 min/week. Chi-squared testing and
      logistic regression determined associations between neighborhood environment and 
      PA, including interaction between social cohesion and walkability. The final
      unweighted sample included 3,826 participants with mean age 64.6 years
      (SE = 0.26), 61.8% female and 78.1% non-Hispanic White. In adjusted, weighted
      analysis, not, slightly, and moderately-walkable neighborhoods all had lower odds
      of meeting PA recommendations verses highly-walkable neighborhood (OR = 0.61[95% 
      CI 0.41–0.92], OR = 0.65[95% CI 0.50–0.85], OR = 0.75[95% CI 0.59–0.97],
      respectively). Social cohesion was independently associated with decreased odds
      of meeting PA guidelines (p = 0.003). No interaction with walkability was found
      (p = 0.405). Less than a highly-walkable neighborhood and lower social cohesion
      were independently associated with decreased odds of meeting PA recommendations
      among adults with arthritis and recent joint pain. Since walking is one of the
      most effective treatments for arthritis, clinicians should be sensitive to
      barriers patients may perceive to walking.

TI  - Current and Emerging Pharmacotherapy for Fibromyalgia.
LID - 6541798
AB  - Introduction. Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a pain disorder with an estimated
      prevalence of 1–5%. It is associated with a variety of somatic and psychological 
      disorders. Its exact pathogenesis is still unclear but is involved with neural
      oversensitization and decreased conditioned pain modulation (CPM), combined with 
      cognitive dysfunction, memory impairment, and altered information processing.
      Connectivity between brain areas involved in pain processing, alertness, and
      cognition is increased in the syndrome, making its pharmacologic therapy complex.
      Only three drugs, pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran are currently
      FDA-approved for FM treatment, but many other agents have been tested over the
      years, with varying efficacy. Areas Covered. The purpose of this review is to
      summarize current clinical experience with different pharmacologic treatments
      used for fibromyalgia and introduce future perspectives in developing therapies. 
      Expert Opinion. Future insights into the fields of cannabinoid and opioid
      research, as well as an integrative approach towards the incorporation of
      genetics and functional imaging combined with additional fields of research
      relevant towards the study of complex CNS disorders, are likely to lead to new
      developments of novel tailor-made treatments for FMS patients.

TI  - Pregabalin Abuse in Combination With Other Drugs: Monitoring Among Methadone
      Patients.
LID - 1022
AB  - Introduction: In recent years, there has been an increase in the non-medical use 
      of psychoactive prescription drugs including pregabalin (PGB). Studies have shown
      that multiple drug users and patients in methadone treatment programs
      administered PGB at high dosages in order to achieve euphoria, reduce withdrawal 
      symptoms, or potentiate the effects of methadone. For these reasons, accurate
      toxicological monitoring is required for these high-risk individuals. Materials
      and Methods: The present study investigated whether PGB could be detected in the 
      hair samples of 250 patients with a history of opiate dependency, and under
      toxicological surveillance assess their compliance with methadone maintenance
      therapy. Results: Opiates were found in 54/250 of all hair samples, while
      cannabis was present in 74/250 patients, cocaine was detected in 21/250 patients,
      and benzodiazepines without prescription were identified in 49/250 patients. As
      expected, methadone was present in all 250 patients (100%). PGB without
      prescription was found in the hair samples of 35/250 patients (14%). Of these,
      91.43% were male, 48.57% were <30 y old, and 45.71% were between ages 30 and 50
      y. There were no apparent associations among PGB use, daily methadone dosage, and
      duration of methadone maintenance therapy. Psychiatric comorbidities were present
      in 25.71% of the patients abusing PGB. Anxiety (55.56%) and depression (33.33%)
      were the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. Discussion: Most of the patients
      taking PGB (57.14%) used other drugs (especially opiates) concurrently. The
      utility of hair analysis is explained by easy and rapid sample collection and the
      ability of the hair to reflect long-term drug use and incorporate drug
      metabolites. The findings of this study suggested that PGB has significant
      potential for abuse by high-risk populations such as opioid users and patients
      with dual diagnosis. These risks are particularly high in cases of poly-drug use 
      and drug intake that are not in compliance with prescription guidelines.

LID - 3072
AB  - With the estimated high prevalence in the population, the two symptoms of pain
      and depression threaten the well-being of millions worldwide. Researches of the
      two symptoms increased year by year. Top-cited studies will help to understand
      the achievement and guide researchers toward the direction of the research field.
      However, it is unclear for researches in the field of pain and depression. In
      this paper, we reviewed the bibliometric characteristics of the top-cited papers 
      about pain and depression. We will review the evidence of authorship, country of 
      origin, institution, journal, study type, and publication year for the 100
      top-cited studies on pain and depression based on the Web of Science Core
      collection. We also highlight studies with the highest cited times. Our study
      concluded that pain and depression were correlated, which may share common
      biological pathways.

TI  - The Efficacy and Safety of Paravertebral Block Combined with Parecoxib During
      Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 355-66
AB  - Background: Although video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is increasingly 
      used, the optimal analgesia strategy is still unknown. We explore the efficacy
      and safety of preemptive ultrasound-guided paravertebral block (PVB) combined
      with parecoxib during VATS. Methods: Seventy-four patients were divided into two 
      groups. PVBs were performed before anesthesia induction under real-time
      ultrasound guidance. Visual analog scale (VAS) score with coughing at 48 h after 
      surgery, postoperative sufentanil consumption and level of sedation (LOS) at 1,
      4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively, intraoperative hemodynamics, satisfaction
      scores of patients and surgeons, remedial measures, time to chest tube removed
      and mobilization, adverse effects and hospital stay length were recorded. We also
      recorded inflammatory markers, respiratory function and the prevalence of chronic
      pain after surgery. Results: VAS scores at rest and with coughing during the
      first 24 h after surgery were significantly lower in the P group (P<0.05).
      Consumption of sevoﬂurane, remifentanil, and dexmedetomidine was all
      significantly reduced in the P group (P<0.05). The consumption of sufentanil
      within 48 h after surgery, time to first dose and total dose of rescue ketorolac 
      was significantly lower in the P group (P<0.05). The FEV1/FVC ratio was
      significantly higher in the P group at 1 and 3 d after surgery (P<0.05). Times to
      chest tube removal and mobilization were significantly shorter in the P group
      (P<0.05). Compared with the C group, the level of both ACTH and cortisol was
      significantly reduced in the P group at 1 and 3 d after surgery (P<0.05).
      Conclusion: PVB combined with parecoxib was associated with better pain relief,
      decreased sufentanil and ketorolac consumption, less hemodynamic instability, and
      a lower surgery-related stress response. However, the incidences of chronic pain 
      3 and 6 months after surgery and the risk of complication except urinary
      retention were not significantly different between groups.

TI  - Bibliometric Analysis of Research Assessing the Use of Acupuncture for Pain
      Treatment Over the Past 20 Years.
PG  - 367-76
AB  - Objective: A bibliometric approach using quantitative analytical methods was
      applied to explore the development of research investigating acupuncture for the 
      treatment of pain. This study also evaluated the current status of acupuncture
      analgesia with a visualization analysis of journal articles. Methods: Articles on
      acupuncture for pain control that were published from 2000 to 2019 were retrieved
      from the Web of Science database. Extracted records were analyzed in terms of
      year of publication, country, journal, research area, authors, and organizational
      affiliations. The VOSviewer program was used to visualize trends in research on
      acupuncture for pain control. Results: Analyses of 4595 original and review
      articles revealed that the total number of publications has continually increased
      over the last 20 years. The country producing the most articles in this field was
      the United States, followed by China and South Korea. A network analysis based on
      the cooccurrence of keywords revealed the following three major types of studies:
      clinical studies, pain management studies, and mechanism studies. Conclusion: The
      present study evaluated research on acupuncture for pain control using
      bibliometric methods and revealed current trends in acupuncture analgesia
      research, as well as potential future hot spots of research in this field.

TI  - Stratified primary care versus non-stratified care for musculoskeletal pain:
      findings from the STarT MSK feasibility and pilot cluster randomized controlled
      trial.
LID - 30
AB  - Background: Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain from the five most common presentations to
      primary care (back, neck, shoulder, knee or multi-site pain), where the majority 
      of patients are managed, is a costly global health challenge. At present,
      first-line decision-making is based on clinical reasoning and stratified models
      of care have only been tested in patients with low back pain. We therefore,
      examined the feasibility of; a) a future definitive cluster randomised controlled
      trial (RCT), and b) General Practitioners (GPs) providing stratified care at the 
      point-of-consultation for these five most common MSK pain presentations. Methods:
      The design was a pragmatic pilot, two parallel-arm (stratified versus
      non-stratified care), cluster RCT and the setting was 8 UK GP practices (4
      intervention, 4 control) with randomisation (stratified by practice size) and
      blinding of trial statistician and outcome data-collectors. Participants were
      adult consulters with MSK pain without indicators of serious pathologies, urgent 
      medical needs, or vulnerabilities. Potential participant records were tagged and 
      individuals sent postal invitations using a GP point-of-consultation electronic
      medical record (EMR) template. The intervention was supported by the EMR template
      housing the Keele STarT MSK Tool (to stratify into low, medium and high-risk
      prognostic subgroups of persistent pain and disability) and recommended matched
      treatment options. Feasibility outcomes included exploration of recruitment and
      follow-up rates, selection bias, and GP intervention fidelity. To capture
      recommended outcomes including pain and function, participants completed an
      initial questionnaire, brief monthly questionnaire (postal or SMS), and 6-month
      follow-up questionnaire. An anonymised EMR audit described GP decision-making.
      Results: GPs screened 3063 patients (intervention = 1591, control = 1472),
      completed the EMR template with 1237 eligible patients (intervention = 513,
      control = 724) and 524 participants (42%) consented to data collection
      (intervention = 231, control = 293). Recruitment took 28 weeks (target 12 weeks) 
      with > 90% follow-up retention (target > 75%). We detected no selection bias of
      concern and no harms identified. GP stratification tool fidelity failed to
      achieve a-priori success criteria, whilst fidelity to the matched treatments
      achieved “complete success”. Conclusions: A future definitive cluster RCT of
      stratified care for MSK pain is feasible and is underway, following key
      amendments including a clinician-completed version of the stratification tool and
      refinements to recommended matched treatments. Trial registration: Name of the
      registry: ISRCTN. Trial registration number: 15366334.Date of registration:

TI  - Protocol for a multi-centre, definitive randomised controlled trial of the
      effectiveness of Individual Placement and Support for employment support among
      people with alcohol and drug dependence.
LID - 167
AB  - Background: Unemployment is highly prevalent in populations with alcohol and drug
      dependence and the employment support offered in addiction-treatment programmes
      is ineffective. Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based
      intervention for competitive employment. IPS has been extensively studied in
      severe mental illness and physical disabilities, but there have been no formal
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in alcohol and drug dependence. The
      Individual Placement and Support for Alcohol and Drug Dependence (IPS-AD) study
      should determine whether IPS for patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), opioid
      use disorder (OUD) and other drug use disorder is effective. Design/methods: The 
      IPS-AD study is a seven-site, pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, superiority
      RCT. IPS-AD includes a realist process evaluation. Eligible patients (adult,
      unemployed or economically inactive for at least 6 months and wishing to obtain
      open job market employment and enrolled in ongoing community treatment-as-usual
      (TAU; the control condition) in England for AUD, OUD and other drug use
      disorders) will be randomised (1:1) to receive TAU and any standard employment
      support, or TAU plus IPS (the experimental condition) for 9 months with up to 4
      months of in-work support. The primary outcome measure will be competitive
      employment status (at least 1 day (7 h)) during an 18-month follow-up, determined
      by patient-level, trial-data-linkage with national tax and state benefit
      databases. From meta-analysis, an 18% target difference on this measure of
      vocational effectiveness (for the experimental intervention) and a two-sided 5%
      level of statistical significance, will require a minimum target sample of 832
      participants to achieve 90% power for a pre-registered, mixed-effects,
      multi-variable logistic regression model. A maximum-likelihood
      multiple-imputation approach will manage missing outcome data. IPS-AD has six
      vocational secondary outcome measures during the 18-month follow-up: (1) total
      time in competitive employment (and corresponding National Insurance
      contributions and tax paid); (2) time from randomisation to first competitive
      employment; (3) number of competitive job appointments; (4) job tenure (length of
      longest held competitive employment); (5) sustained employment (tenure in a
      single appointment for at least 13 weeks); and (6) job search self-efficacy. A
      primary cost-benefit analysis and a secondary cost-effectiveness analysis will be
      done using the primary outcome and secondary vocational outcomes, respectively
      and will include addiction treatment and social and health outcomes and their
      associated reference costs. The process evaluation will address IPS
      implementation and delivery. Discussion: The IPS-AD study is the first
      large-scale, multi-site, definitive, superiority RCT of IPS for people with
      alcohol and drug dependence. Findings from the study will have substantial
      implications for service delivery. Trial registration: ISRCTN Registry, ID:
      ISRCTN24159790. Registered on 1 February 2018.

TI  - Different doses of galcanezumab versus placebo in patients with migraine and
      cluster headache: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: Galcanezumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that target to calcitonin
      gene-related peptide (CGRP). It has been tested for the preventive treatment of
      migraine and episodic cluster headache by multiple randomized clinical trials
      (RCTs) and have been found to reduce headache frequency. Methods: We
      systematically searched PubMed and Embase on Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from the earliest date to August 1, 2019. Relative
      risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) were used to evaluate clinical
      outcomes. Results: Seven studies were pooled with 3889 patients. Subcutaneous
      injection of Galcanezumab at 120 mg, 240 mg leads to a statistically significant 
      response rate for the treatment of migraine compared with placebo (120 mg:
      RR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.70; P < 0.001; 240 mg: RR = 1.58; 95% CI, 1.43 to
      1.76; P < 0.001). Among them, 120 mg group has the same treatment efficacy with
      240 mg group (50% response: RR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.22; P = 0.425; 75%
      response: RR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.23; P = 0.301; 100% response; RR = 1.06;
      95% CI, 0.81 to 1.37; P = 0.682; MHD: RR = − 0.08; 95% CI, − 0.55 to − 0.40;
      P = 0.748) while related to a lower risk for adverse events for the treatment of 
      migraine (120 mg RR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.14; P = 0.084; 240 mg: RR = 1.17;
      95% CI, 1.09 to 1.25; P < 0.001). 300 mg per month galcanezumab is effective for 
      the prevention of episodic cluster headache measured by at least 50% reduction of
      cluster headache frequency at week 3 (RR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00–1.84; P = 0.048).
      Conclusions: Use of galcanezumab is related to a significantly reduced monthly
      headache frequency compared with placebo for the treatment of migraine and
      episodic cluster headache, 120 mg has the same treatment efficacy with 240 mg
      group while related to a lower risk for adverse effects for the treatment of
      migraine. 300 mg per month galcanezumab is effective for the prevention of
      episodic cluster headache with no significantly increased adverse events.

TI  - Electroacupuncture for postoperative pain after nasal endoscopic surgery: study
      protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
LID - 163
AB  - Background: Postoperative pain is common after nasal endoscopic surgery. It
      interferes with the quality of sleep and delays postoperative recovery.
      Acupuncture is an effective tool for pain management. However, electroacupuncture
      specifically for the relief of postoperative pain after nasal endoscopic surgery 
      has not yet been studied in a randomized controlled trial. Methods/design: This
      randomized sham-controlled patient- and assessor-blind pilot trial has been
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in managing
      postoperative pain following nasal endoscopic surgery to treat sinusitis due to
      nasal polyps. Altogether, 30 participants will be randomly allocated to an
      electroacupuncture or non-invasive sham control in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment will
      occur within 2 h before the operation, immediately after the operation upon
      arrival in the recovery ward, and once daily for 3 days. The primary outcome is
      the pain numerical rating scale, which will be analyzed using the area under the 
      curve. The secondary outcome measures include heart rate and blood pressure after
      the operation, sleep quality during the hospital stay (actigraph), quality of
      recovery, and the 36-item short form health survey. This trial will use an
      intention-to-treat analysis. Discussion: This pilot randomized controlled trial
      will explore the feasibility of the further clinical application of
      electroacupuncture for the management of postoperative pain. It will inform the
      design of a further full-scale trial. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial 
      Registry, ChiCTR1900024183. Registered on 29 June 2019.

TI  - Complementary roles of murine NaV1.7, NaV1.8 and NaV1.9 in acute itch signalling.
LID - 2326
AB  - Acute pruritus occurs in various disorders. Despite severe repercussions on
      quality of life treatment options remain limited. Voltage-gated sodium channels
      (NaV) are indispensable for transformation and propagation of sensory signals
      implicating them as drug targets. Here, NaV1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 were compared for
      their contribution to itch by analysing NaV-specific knockout mice. Acute
      pruritus was induced by a comprehensive panel of pruritogens (C48/80, endothelin,
      5-HT, chloroquine, histamine, lysophosphatidic acid, trypsin, SLIGRL, β-alanine, 
      BAM8-22), and scratching was assessed using a magnet-based recording technology. 
      We report an unexpected stimulus-dependent diversity in NaV channel-mediated itch
      signalling. NaV1.7−/− showed substantial scratch reduction mainly towards strong 
      pruritogens. NaV1.8−/− impaired histamine and 5-HT-induced scratching while
      NaV1.9 was involved in itch signalling towards 5-HT, C48/80 and SLIGRL.
      Furthermore, similar microfluorimetric calcium responses of sensory neurons and
      expression of itch-related TRP channels suggest no change in sensory transduction
      but in action potential transformation and conduction. The cumulative sum of
      scratching over all pruritogens confirmed a leading role of NaV1.7 and indicated 
      an overall contribution of NaV1.9. Beside the proposed general role of NaV1.7 and
      1.9 in itch signalling, scrutiny of time courses suggested NaV1.8 to sustain
      prolonged itching. Therefore, NaV1.7 and 1.9 may represent targets in pruritus
      therapy.

TI  - Impact of bottle size on in-home consumption of wine: feasibility and
      acceptability randomised cross-over study.
LID - 19
AB  - Background: Reducing alcohol consumption across populations would prevent many
      non-communicable diseases. Large packages increase food and non-alcoholic drink
      consumption and large glasses increase wine consumption. Smaller bottles may
      reduce alcohol consumption but their impact is uncertain. This study aims to (i) 
      explore the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a large-scale randomised 
      study to assess the impact of bottle size on in-home wine consumption and (ii)
      estimate the effect size and variance of the intervention on consumption to
      inform the design of future studies. Methods: Cross-over randomised study in
      which 16 households in Cambridge, England, consuming at least two 750-ml bottles 
      of wine each week, received a pre-set volume of wine biweekly for 4 weeks, in
      750-ml and 375-ml bottles, in random order. Consumption was assessed by recording
      the number of empty and partially full bottles at the end of each biweekly
      period. At the end of the study, household representatives were interviewed about
      their experiences of participating in the study. Results: The study procedures
      proved feasible. Comparable to similar trials, 14% of identified eligible
      households (18/125) consented to participate in the study. Attrition between
      consent and study completion was 11% (2/18) and 0% between study periods and 13% 
      of households (2/16) correctly identified the study aim. The study procedures
      were considered acceptable. After adjusting for guest and out-of-home
      consumption, the difference in consumption between the 750-ml (3385.2 ml;
      SD = 1698.5) and 375-ml bottles (3376.7 ml; SD = 1719.0) was 8.4 ml (SD = 1235.4;
      95%CI − 596.9, 613.8). Results suggest a possible order effect, with households
      receiving the 375-ml bottles first consuming more wine out of the 750-ml bottles 
      and vice versa. This might also reflect an increase in consumption with study
      duration. Households receiving the 375-ml bottles first (6315.9 ml; SD = 3293.5) 
      also drank less wine overall than those receiving the 750-ml bottles first
      (7335.4 ml; SD = 3735.4). Discussion: The findings support the feasibility and
      acceptability of running a large-scale randomised study to assess the impact of
      bottle size on in-home wine consumption. Due to the heterogeneous patterning of
      results, a future study will be powered using the variance observed in the
      current study to detect a meaningful reduction of 250 ml of wine when consumed
      from smaller compared with larger bottles. Trial registration: Open Science
      Framework (OSF): rmk43; May 23, 2017.

TI  - Can Botulinum Toxin A Play a Role in Treatment of Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome in
      Female Patients?—Clinical and Animal Evidence.
LID - 110
AB  - Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as chronic pain and inflammation in the
      pelvic organs for more than six months. There are wide ranges of clinical
      presentations, including pelvic pain, painful intercourse, irritable bowel
      syndrome, and pain during urinating. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is a
      subdivision of CPP, and the pain syndrome may be focused within a single organ or
      more than one pelvic organ. As there is uncertain pathogenesis, no standard
      treatment is currently available for CPPS. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) is a potent
      neurotoxin that blocks acetylcholine release to paralyze muscles. Intravesical
      BoNT-A injection can reduce bladder pain in patients with interstitial
      cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. BoNT-A injected into the pelvic floor muscles of 
      women has also been reported to improve chronic pain syndrome. Due to the
      reversible effect of BoNT-A, repeated injection appears to be necessary and
      effective in reducing symptoms. Adverse effects of BoNT-A may worsen the
      preexisting conditions, including constipation, stress urinary incontinence, and 
      fecal incontinence. This review summarizes the evidence of BoNT-A treatment for
      CPPS in animal studies and clinical studies regarding the therapeutic effects of 
      BoNT-A for CPPS in female patients.

TI  - Epidural Fibrin Sealant Injection for the Management of Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak 
      Following Dural Puncture in Children.
LID - e6940
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, intracranial hypotension, and postdural puncture 
      headaches are common following dural punctures. Management usually consists of
      conservative treatments with medications (e.g. caffeine, nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, opioids), increased fluid intake, and bed
      rest. In more severe and persistent cases, epidural blood patches (EBPs) are
      indicated. When multiple EBPs fail, epidural injection of fibrin sealant has been
      successful in a few reported adult cases. The authors describe the first reported
      clinical experiences of epidural fibrin patch in children for repair of CSF leak 
      and resolution of intracranial hypotension. This technique was used in three
      cases where serial EBPs failed to resolve symptoms related to intracranial
      hypotension following dural puncture. Following the procedure, each patient had
      resolution of their presenting clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities, 
      and there were no noted complications. Epidural fibrin sealant injection is a
      reasonable option for relieving intracranial hypotension due to CSF leak
      following dural puncture in children.

TI  - Cardiac Arrhythmia Secondary to Loperamide Abuse and Toxicity.
LID - e6936
AB  - Loperamide is a synthetic, over-the-counter, antidiarrheal medication that is
      widely available and used for the treatment of diarrhea. It is a peripherally
      acting opioid agonist acting mostly on the μ-opioid receptors in the gut. It was 
      thought to be a very safe medication up until very recently, as the
      bioavailability of the drug is very low. At significantly higher doses, it is
      able to cross the blood-brain barrier and mimic the effects of centrally acting
      opioids. However, at these significantly high doses it also leads to significant 
      cardiotoxic consequences. Here we present a case of a 31-year-old male with
      significant cardiotoxicity secondary to misuse and abuse of loperamide.

TI  - Retrospective Data Analysis and Literature Review for a Development of Enhanced
      Recovery after Surgery Pathway for Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion.
LID - e6930
AB  - ObjectiveWhile enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are associated
      with shorter length of stay and improved outcomes in multiple surgical
      specialties, its application to spine surgery has been limited. Anterior cervical
      discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a common spinal procedure with a relative
      efficacy and safety profile that makes it suitable for the application of ERAS
      principles. Reviewing our outcomes and practice and incorporating evidence-based 
      clinical studies, we propose the development of an ERAS pathway for
      ACDF.MethodsThis is a retrospective review of ACDF cases performed at a single
      institution by a single surgeon from 2014 to 2017. Primary outcome measures
      included length of stay, complications, and 30-day readmission rates. The 1- and 
      2-level and the 3- and 4-level groups were also each consolidated into a single
      cohort for comparison. A comprehensive review of evidence-based literature
      pertaining to ACDF was then performed. Best-practice recommendations derived from
      the literature were incorporated into the proposed ERAS protocol.ResultsIn this
      series of 75 1-level, 77 2-level, 44 3-level and 20 4-level ACDF procedures, the 
      average surgical time (minutes) was 68, 90, 118 and 141; length of stay (days)
      was 1, 1, 1.4, and 1.7; drain usage (%) was 1.3, 2.6, 13.6 and 10; and 30-day
      readmission rates (%) were 2.7, 3.9, 4.5, and 15, respectively. Combining the 1- 
      and 2-level as a single group and 3- and 4-level as another cohort, the 3- and
      4-level cohort had a significantly higher rate of drain usage and estimated blood
      loss (EBL) but there was not a difference in length-of-stay, complications or
      30-day readmission rates.ConclusionsGiven the relative equivalent safety profile 
      between 1- and 2-level as compared to 3- and 4-level ACDF, the proposed ERAS
      pathway can be applied to all patients, and not just restricted to 1-level or
      2-level ACDF. Taking into account feasibility parameters as deduced from a review
      of institutional outcomes, this pathway can streamline same-day discharge and
      improve the patient experience. Its success will be predicated on an iterative
      improvement process deriving from optimal prospective outcome measurements.

TI  - A Prospective Study on the Predictability of Propofol Injection Pain.
LID - e6945
AB  - IntroductionIn this prospective study, we aimed to determine if there was a link 
      between pain on propofol injection (POPI) and various hemogram parameters and
      ratios.MethodsThe study was designed to include 100 consecutive male patients
      undergoing surgery in a tertiary hospital in February 2017. Preoperatively
      collected data included patients’ age, weight, height, hemogram parameters (white
      blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, mean 
      platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), plateletcrit (PCT),
      hemoglobin, and hematocrit). All patients’ hemograms were performed using the
      same device. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, and
      systemic immune inflammatory score (SII) were calculated from this data.Patients 
      received prior information that pain would be questioned during propofol
      injection. The pain was grouped between 0 and 3 (0 no pain, 1 mild pain, 2
      moderate pain, 3 severe pain).Patients were questioned by the anesthesiologist
      about their level of pain at five-second intervals until loss of consciousness
      occurred. The same anesthesiologist also used the McCririck and Hunter’s verbal
      rating score (VRS) to evaluate pain. The patients’ heart rate and blood pressure 
      were also recorded after induction.ResultsAn extremely significant correlation
      was found between the presence of POPI and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR),
      platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and SII ratios (p<0.001). All three parameters
      were found to be significant in predicting the presence of POPI. The higher area 
      under the curve (AUC) was found for SII.The cutoff value for SII’s prediction of 
      POPI was calculated to be 479,000, with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of
      68%. Patients with an NLR of >497000 had a 4.63 times higher risk of POPI (odds
      ratio: 4.63, 95% CI: 1.6714 - 12.7982).ConclusionOur study is the first to show
      that POPI can be predicted by using NLR, PLR, and SII. Our data also
      support other studies that have reported a relationship between the inflammatory 
      biomarker NLR and pain perception.

TI  - Non-interventional study evaluating exposure to inhaled, low-dose methoxyflurane 
      experienced by hospital emergency department personnel in France.
LID - e034647
AB  - Objectives: Low-dose methoxyflurane is a non-opioid, inhaled analgesic
      administered via the Penthrox inhaler and was recently licensed in Europe for
      emergency relief of moderate-to-severe trauma-associated pain in conscious
      adults. This non-interventional study investigated occupational exposure to
      methoxyflurane in the hospital emergency department (ED) personnel during routine
      clinical practice. Setting and participants: The study was conducted in two
      hospital ED triage rooms in France over a 2-week and 3-week period, respectively.
      Low-dose methoxyflurane analgesia was self-administered by patients via the
      inhaler under the supervision of nursing staff, per routine clinical practice. An
      organic vapour personal badge sampler was attached to the uniform of the nurses
      working in the treatment rooms throughout an 8-hour shift (total of 140 shifts
      during the study period). Seven-day ambient air monitoring of each treatment room
      was also performed. Methoxyflurane levels adsorbed in each badge sampler were
      measured by a central laboratory. The primary objective was to evaluate
      methoxyflurane exposure experience by the hospital ED nurses during an 8-hour
      shift. Results: In 138 badge samplers, the median (range) concentration of
      methoxyflurane present following 8-hour nursing shifts was 0.017 (0.008, 0.736)
      ppm. This level was almost 900-fold lower than the previously reported
      8-hour-derived maximal exposure level of 15 ppm; methoxyflurane exposure
      approaching this threshold was not documented in any badges. There was no
      correlation between the number of applications of low-dose methoxyflurane
      administered during a shift (range 0–5) and the vapour exposure measured on the
      personal badge samplers. Conclusions: This study indicates that nurses working in
      hospital EDs experience very low levels of occupational exposure to
      methoxyflurane vapour during routine clinical practice. These real-world data can
      provide reassurance to healthcare providers supervising patients receiving
      low-dose methoxyflurane analgesia via a Penthrox inhaler; further studies may
      inform exposure in other hospital ED settings.

TI  - Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Joint Fusion: The Current Evidence.
PG  - 20-9
AB  - Background: Fusion of the sacroiliac (SI) joint as a treatment for low back pain 
      remains controversial. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the current
      literature and clinical outcomes of SI joint fusion surgery. Methods: We
      conducted a literature review and included studies with the term “sacroiliac
      joint fusion” that had at least 12 months of clinical follow-up, reported on
      minimally invasive techniques, and included patient-reported outcome measures.
      Results: Two approach types (dorsal and lateral) and numerous different implant
      manufacturers were identified. Most studies included level 4 data, with a small
      number of level 2 prospective cohort studies and 2 prospective level 1 studies.
      Every reviewed study reported clinical benefit in terms of improved pain scores
      or improvement in validated disability measures. Complication rates were low.
      Conclusions: Minimally invasive SI joint fusion provides clinically significant
      improvement in pain scores and disability in most patients, across multiple
      studies and implant manufacturers. Level of Evidence: 5 Clinical Relevance:
      Emerging evidence in support of SI joint fusion indicates that clinicians should 
      examine the SI joint and include SI joint pain in their differential diagnosis
      for low back pain patients.

TI  - Postoperative Pain Management in Emergency Surgeries: A One-year Survey on
      Perception and Satisfaction among Surgical Patients.
PG  - 42-7
AB  - Background:: Postoperative pain varies from an individual to individual. It also 
      varies with types and extent of surgery. In general, postoperative pain is
      inadequately managed in most centers worldwide, especially in developing
      countries. Therefore, this study presents the perception and satisfaction of
      postoperative pain management in emergency surgeries. Methods:: A 1-year
      prospective study of the 891 patients who underwent emergency general surgeries
      at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, from January to December 2018 is
      hereby presented. Pain scores and patient's satisfaction toward postoperative
      pain management were considered at 8 and 24 h postoperatively through a
      predesigned questionnaire. Numeric Pain Rating Scale was used to determine pain
      intensity and the level of satisfaction following postoperative pain management. 
      Student's t-test was used to compare the pain scores and patient's level of
      satisfaction of the postoperative pain management. Results:: A total of 891
      patients were recruited for this study, with a mean age of 36.4 ± 8.9 years with 
      a male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1. Postoperative pain management satisfaction score
      for patients (98%) who had pain 8-h postoperative period was 4.8 ± 1.6.
      Similarly, 96.4% of the patients who had pain 24 h postoperatively scored 2.8 ±
      1.7. Majority of the patients 481 (54%) were of the American Society of
      Anesthesiologist physical Class II. Most of the patients underwent general
      surgery using the technique of general anesthesia. Conclusion:: This study
      indicated that the perception and level of patient's satisfaction regarding
      postoperative pain management are inadequate. The health professionals and policy
      makers should be aware that postoperative pain management is suboptimal, as
      patients still have severe postoperative pain. Therefore, the need for improved
      postoperative pain management.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential of Flavonoids in Pain and Inflammation: Mechanisms of
      Action, Pre-Clinical and Clinical Data, and Pharmaceutical Development.
LID - 762
AB  - Pathological pain can be initiated after inflammation and/or peripheral nerve
      injury. It is a consequence of the pathological functioning of the nervous system
      rather than only a symptom. In fact, pain is a significant social, health, and
      economic burden worldwide. Flavonoids are plant derivative compounds easily found
      in several fruits and vegetables and consumed in the daily food intake.
      Flavonoids vary in terms of classes, and while structurally unique, they share a 
      basic structure formed by three rings, known as the flavan nucleus. Structural
      differences can be found in the pattern of substitution in one of these rings.
      The hydroxyl group (–OH) position in one of the rings determines the mechanisms
      of action of the flavonoids and reveals a complex multifunctional activity.
      Flavonoids have been widely used for their antioxidant, analgesic, and
      anti-inflammatory effects along with safe preclinical and clinical profiles. In
      this review, we discuss the preclinical and clinical evidence on the analgesic
      and anti-inflammatory proprieties of flavonoids. We also focus on how the
      development of formulations containing flavonoids, along with the understanding
      of their structure-activity relationship, can be harnessed to identify novel
      flavonoid-based therapies to treat pathological pain and inflammation.

TI  - Systematic Administration of B Vitamins Alleviates Diabetic Pain and Inhibits
      Associated Expression of P2X3 and TRPV1 in Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons and
      Proinflammatory Cytokines in Spinal Cord in Rats.
LID - 3740162
AB  - Background: Treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) continues to be a major 
      challenge, and underlying mechanisms of DNP remain elusive. We investigated
      treatment effects of B vitamins on DPN- and DNP-associated alterations of
      neurochemical signaling in the nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and
      the spinal cord in rats. Methods: DNP was produced in male, adult, Sprague Dawley
      rats by single i.p. streptozotocin (STZ). Western blot analysis and
      immunohistochemistry were used to analyze protein expressions in DRG and ELISA to
      measure the proinflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord. Behaviorally expressed 
      DNP was determined by measuring the sensitivity of hindpaw skin to mechanical and
      thermal stimulation. Results: There were 87.5% (77/88) rats which developed high 
      blood glucose within 1-2 weeks following STZ injection. Of which, 70.13%
      (n = 54/77) animals exhibited DNP manifested as mechanical allodynia and/or
      thermal hyperalgesia. Intraperitoneal administration of vitamins B1/B6/B12
      (100/100/2 mg/kg, one or multiple doses) significantly attenuated DNP without
      affecting the blood glucose. Expressions of P2X3 and TRPV1 in CGRP-positive and
      IB4-positive DRG neurons as well as the interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, 
      and nerve growth factor in the lumbar spinal cord were greatly increased in DNP
      rats. Such DNP-associated neurochemical alterations were also greatly suppressed 
      by the B-vitamin treatment. Conclusions: B-vitamin treatment can greatly suppress
      chronic DNP and DNP-associated increased activities of P2X3 and TRPV1 in DRG and 
      the spinal proinflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of
      DNP. Systematic administration of B vitamins can be a strategy for DNP management
      in clinic.

      cases due to the evolution of penicillin and vaccination. However,
      immunocompromised and unvaccinated patients are still at grave risk.Case: A
      58-year-old African American male who used alcohol and intravenous (IV) drugs
      presented with confusion, fever, and hemoptysis. He had coarse rhonchi with a
      grade 2/5 holosystolic apical murmur. CT chest showed diffuse bilateral
      infiltrates. Blood cultures were positive for pansensitive Streptococcus
      pneumoniae. Echocardiogram demonstrated large vegetations on the anterior and
      posterior leaflets of the mitral valve with flail leaflet and severe eccentric
      mitral regurgitation. Patient was started on IV ceftriaxone, but after 3 weeks of
      therapy, he wished to leave against medical advice. He was discharged on
      combination oral therapy with successful resolution of SPE on
      follow-up.Discussion: Invasive pneumococcus is highly virulent causing
      irreversible valvular destruction or death.IV beta-lactams are first-line
      treatment, but there are currently no guideline-recommended alternatives for oral
      therapy. Recent data suggest partial oral therapy may be noninferior to IV only
      therapy.Conclusion: Switching to oral combination antibiotics after at least 2
      weeks of IV therapy is an acceptable alternative to treat SPE.

TI  - Anesthetic Strategies in Oncological Surgery: Not Only a Simple Sleep, but Also
      Impact on Immunosuppression and Cancer Recurrence.
PG  - 931-40
AB  - Tumor recurrences or metastases remain a major hurdle in improving overall cancer
      survival. In the perioperative period, the balance between the ability of the
      cancer to seed and grow at the metastatic site and the ability of the patient to 
      fight against the tumor (i.e. the host antitumor immunity) may determine the
      development of clinically evident metastases and influence the patient outcome.
      Up to 80% of oncological patients receive anesthesia and/or analgesia for
      diagnostic, therapeutic or palliative interventions. Therefore, anesthesiologists
      are asked to administer drugs such as opiates and volatile or intravenous
      anesthetics, which may determine different effects on immunomodulation and cancer
      recurrence. For instance, some studies suggest that intravenous drugs, such as
      propofol, may inhibit the host immunity to a lower extent as compared to volatile
      anesthetics. Similarly, some studies suggest that analgesia assured by local
      anesthetics may provide a reduction of cancer recurrence rate; whilst on the
      opposite side, opioids may exert negative consequences in patients undergoing
      cancer surgery, by interacting with the immune system response via the modulation
      of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system, or
      directly through the opioid receptors on the surface of immune cells. In this
      review, we summarize the main findings on the effects induced by different drugs 
      on immunomodulation and cancer recurrence.

TI  - Risk factors for pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations in long-term care
      facility residents: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 47
AB  - Background: Older adults who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at
      particularly high risk for infection, morbidity and mortality from pneumonia and 
      influenza (P&I) compared to individuals of younger age and those living outside
      institutional settings. The risk factors for P&I hospitalizations that are
      specific to LTCFs remain poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the
      incidence of P&I hospitalization and associated person- and facility-level
      factors among post-acute (short-stay) and long-term (long-stay) care residents
      residing in LTCFs from 2013 to 2015. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study,
      we used Medicare administrative claims linked to Minimum Data Set and LTCF-level 
      data to identify short-stay (< 100 days, index = admission date) and long-stay
      (100+ days, index = day 100) residents who were followed from the index date
      until the first of hospitalization, LTCF discharge, Medicare disenrollment, or
      death. We measured incidence rates (IRs) for P&I hospitalization per 100,000
      person-days, and estimated associations with baseline demographics, geriatric
      syndromes, clinical characteristics, and medication use using Cox regression
      models. Results: We analyzed data from 1,118,054 short-stay and 593,443 long-stay
      residents. The crude 30-day IRs (95% CI) of hospitalizations with P&I in the
      principal position were 26.0 (25.4, 26.6) and 34.5 (33.6, 35.4) among short- and 
      long-stay residents, respectively. The variables associated with P&I varied
      between short and long-stay residents, and common risk factors included: advanced
      age (85+ years), admission from an acute hospital, select cardiovascular and
      respiratory conditions, impaired functional status, and receipt of antibiotics or
      Beers criteria medications. Facility staffing and care quality measures were
      important risk factors among long-stay residents but not in short-stay residents.
      Conclusions: Short-stay residents had lower crude 30- and 90-day incidence rates 
      of P&I hospitalizations than long-stay LTCF residents. Differences in risk
      factors for P&I between short- and long-stay populations suggest the importance
      of considering distinct profiles of post-acute and long-term care residents in
      infection prevention and control strategies in LTCFs. These findings can help
      clinicians target interventions to subgroups of LTCF residents at highest P&I
      risk.

TI  - Dental caries and periodontal disease among people who use drugs: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
LID - 44
AB  - Background: The aim of our study was to perform a systematic review of the
      literature and meta-analysis in order to investigate relationship between drug
      use and oral health. Methods: We searched for studies in English published before
      July 1, 2019 on PsycINFO, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, and Web of Science. We assessed
      the relationship between drug use (methamphetamines, heroin; opiates; crack,
      cocaine and cannabis as dependent variables) and reported tooth loss, periodontal
      disease, or decayed, missing, and filled teeth index as an independent variable. 
      The data were analyzed using Stata 12.0 software. Results: We initially
      identified 1836 potential articles (with 1100 duplicates) and screened the
      remaining 736 titles and abstracts, comprising 54 studies. In the next step, we
      evaluated the full-texts; 44 studies were excluded, accordingly. In total, we
      included 10 publications in the meta-analysis. Drug type was associated with
      periodontal disease (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.8–2.6) and pooled estimates showed that
      type of drug used increased the odds of the number of decayed, missed and filled 
      teeth (DMFT) (OR 4.11; 95% CI 2.07–8.15) respectively. Conclusions: The
      analytical challenges of segregating the impact of individual drug types on oral 
      health diseases mean that investigations on the direct relationship between oral 
      health status and drug use are limited. Developing programs to improve potential 
      confounding with various substances and addressing the dental health needs of
      people who use drugs is vital if we are to improve their overall quality of life.

TI  - Intubation in acute alcohol intoxications at the emergency department.
LID - 11
AB  - Background: Guidelines recommend endotracheal intubation in trauma patients with 
      a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) < 9 because of the loss of airway reflexes and
      consequential risk of airway obstruction. However, in patients with acute alcohol
      intoxication guidelines are not clear. Thus, we aimed to determine the
      proportional incidence of intubation in alcohol intoxication and compare the
      clinical characteristics of intubated and non-intubated patients, as well as
      reasons for intubation in all patients and in the subgroup of patients with
      reduced GCS (< 9) but without traumatic brain injury. Methods: We performed a
      retrospective analysis of all consultations to an urban ED in Switzerland that
      presented with an acute alcohol intoxication between 1st June 2012 and 31th Mai
      2017. Patient and emergency consultations’ characteristics, related injuries,
      intubation and reason for intubations were extracted. As a subgroup analysis, we 
      analysed the patients with a GCS < 9 without a traumatic brain injury. Results:
      Of 3003 consultations included from 01.06.2012 to 31.05.2017, 68 were intubated, 
      leading to a proportional incidence of 2.3% intubations in alcohol-intoxication. 
      Intubated patients had a lower blood alcohol concentration (1.3 g/kg [IQR
      1.0–2.2] vs. 1.6 g/kg [IQR1.1–2.2], p = 0.034) and less often suffered from
      chronic alcohol abuse (1183 [39.4%] patients vs. 14 [20.6%], p = 0.001) than
      non-intubated patients. Patients with trauma were intubated more often (33
      patients [48.5%] vs. 742 [25.3%], p < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, 110/145
      patients (74.3%) were not intubated; again, more intubated patients had a history
      of trauma (9 patients [25.7%] vs. 10 [9.1%], p = 0.011). Conclusions: Intubation 
      in alcohol-intoxicated patients is rare and, among intoxicated patients with GCS 
      < 9, more than two thirds were not intubated in our study - without severe
      complications. Trauma in general, independent of the history of a traumatic brain
      injury, and a missing history of chronic alcohol abuse are associated with
      intubation, but not with blood alcohol concentration. Special caution is required
      for intoxicated patients with trauma or other additional intoxications or
      diseases.

      and inflammation control after total hip arthroplasty for elder patients: a
      randomized control study.
LID - 42
AB  - Objective: This study aims to investigate the efficiency of fascia iliaca
      compartment block (FICB) combined with dexmedetomidine (DEX) in postoperative and
      inflammation management for elder patients after total hip arthroplasty. Methods:
      The present randomized controlled study included a total of 119 elder patients
      who received total hip arthroplasty in our hospital from March 2016 to December
      2018. These patients were divided into three groups: control group, patients
      received routine general anesthesia; FICB group, patients received additional
      FICB after surgery; and combined group, patients received both pre-treatment of
      DEX and post-treatment of fascia iliaca compartment block. The serum levels of
      interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by ELISA.
      The visual analog scale (VAS) score was measured at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after
      surgery, and the patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) pressing time
      within 48 h after surgery was also recorded. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index
      (PSQI) was used to measure the sleep quality before and at 1 month after surgery.
      Results: The VAS scores were significantly lower in patients in the combined
      group, when compared with the other two groups, at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after
      surgery. In addition, the VAS scores at all time points were significantly lower 
      in the FICB group than the control group. The PCIA pressing times were also
      remarkably lower in the combined group. At 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery, the
      serum levels of these inflammatory factors were the lowest in the combined group,
      and the PSQI scores were significantly lower in the combined group, when compared
      with the other two groups, while the control group had the highest PSQI scores
      among the three groups. There was no severe side effects and significant
      difference observed. Conclusion: FICB combined with DEX reduced the postoperative
      pain, improved the sleep condition, and decreased the serum levels of
      inflammatory factors after total hip arthroplasty.

TI  - Retroperitoneal perforation of a duodenal diverticulum containing a large
      enterolith after Roux-en-Y bypass and cholecystectomy.
LID - rjz383
AB  - Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most frequently performed bariatric
      procedures worldwide. The postoperative incidence of cholelithiasis after RYGB is
      higher than in the general population (30% vs. 2–5%), because the altered anatomy
      may lead to impaired gallbladder motility and biliary stasis. We report the case 
      of a 47-year-old female who presented 9 years after RYGB and cholecystectomy with
      acute pain in the upper abdomen because of a retroperitoneal perforation of a
      duodenal diverticulum. Intraoperatively, a huge enterolith was found in the
      diverticulum and removed via duodenotomy. We claim that the stone grew during the
      sober states as the bile accumulated locally, because the gall bladder has
      already been removed and no duodenal food passage remained. This acute and
      life-threatening situation was successfully managed by operation. Consequently, a
      duodenal diverticulum has to be considered as a possible but very rare
      complication after RYGB and cholecystectomy.

TI  - The effect of adjuvant oral application of honey in the management of
      postoperative pain after tonsillectomy in adults: A pilot study.
LID - e0228481
AB  - Objective: To analyze the effect of adjuvant oral application of honey for
      treating postoperative pain after tonsillectomy. Design: Single centre
      prospective cohort study. Setting: Two cohorts of patients after tonsillectomy.
      Participants: 56 patients treated with honey 8 times per day (honey group), 18
      patients treated without honey (control group); baseline analgesia were
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) or coxibs; opioids were used as pro
      re nata (PRN) medication; mean age 34.4 ± 13.4 years; 36% women. Main outcome
      measures: On first to fifth postoperative day, patients rated their pain using
      the validated questionnaire of the German-wide project Quality Improvement in
      Postoperative Pain Treatment (QUIPS) including a numeric rating scale (NRS, 0–10)
      for determination of patient's pain. QUIPS allows standardized assessment of
      patients' characteristics andpain-associated patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
      The influence of preoperative and postoperative parameters on patients'
      postoperative pain were estimated by univariate and multivariate statistical
      analysis. Results: Average pain in activity in the control group was greater than
      4 (NRS 4.4 ± 2.4) during the first five postoperative days, with a renewed
      increase in pain intensity on the fifth day (4.3 ± 2.5). In the honey group, the 
      pain in activity decreased without any further pain increase and was only higher 
      than 4 on the first three postoperative days (4.3 ± 2.1, all p>0.05). However;
      neither minimal nor maximal pain were significantly different between both groups
      on the first postoperative day (p = 0.217, p = 0.980). Over the five
      postoperative days, the minimal and maximal pain in the honey group decreased
      continuously and faster than in the control group. With regard to pain-related
      impairments on the first day, the honey group reported less pain-related sleep
      disturbance (p = 0.026), as well as significantly fewer episodes of postoperative
      oral bleeding (p = 0.028) than the control group. Patients without honey
      consumption had on the first and fifth postoperative day a higher risk of
      increased minimal pain (OR = -2.424, CI = -4.075 –-0.385). Gender was an
      independent factor for compliance of honey consumption on the second
      postoperative day (p = 0.037). Men had a lower probability for compliance of
      honey consumption (OR = -0.288, CI = -2.863 –-0.090). Conclusion: There was a
      trend of reduced postoperative pain after oral honey application. Honey also
      seems to reduce pain-related impairments. The need for additional opioids on the 
      first day could be reduced. A larger controlled trial is now needed to varify the
      effect of honey on pain after tonsillectomy. Clinical trial registration number: 
      German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00006153. The authors confirm that all
      ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered.

TI  - Birds Drinking Alcohol: Species and Relationship with People. A Review of
      Information from Scientific Literature and Social Media.
LID - 270
AB  - Simple Summary: Alcohol consumption is quite common in the bird world. Using
      scientific literature and Internet resources (available because of the rising
      popularity of social media), we investigate which species and sources of ethanol 
      are most frequently used by captive and wild birds. Moreover, it was possible
      with the internet videos to discriminate between intentional and unintentional
      ingestion. This information may be helpful in choosing appropriate species for
      future laboratory studies about ethanol metabolism in birds and their behaviour. 
      Abstract: Ethanol is a natural by-product of the fermentation process of fruit
      sugars and is occasionally consumed by fruit-eating and tree sap drinking birds. 
      Information on this form of alcohol consumption features in the scientific
      literature. However, as pets or as wild animals living close to humans in urban
      habitats, birds have increasing possibilities to consume alcohol from beverages, 
      such as beer, wine or spirits. Some observations have been discussed in a
      light-hearted manner in mass media and social media, but without any
      generalization of why some bird species drink the beverages intentionally or
      unintentionally provided by humans. To check which species and in what
      circumstances birds drink alcohol and how this is evaluated by humans, we
      reviewed the scientific literature and analysed videos from YouTube. In total we 
      found and analysed 8 scientific papers and 179 YouTube videos, from which we
      identified at least 55 species (in some cases not all birds were identified to
      species level), 11 in the scientific literature and 47 in videos. The
      distribution of these species over the avian phylogenetic tree suggests that the 
      origin of this convergent behaviour is mainly by human influence. The two data
      sources differed in the species covered. Videos typically presented interactions 
      of birds with human-provided alcoholic beverages, and were dominated by two
      groups of intelligent birds: parrots and corvids. The popularity of YouTube
      videos for a particular species was positively correlated with the general
      popularity of the species as measured by the number of hits (results listed) on
      Google. Human responses to the videos were generally very positive and we
      analysed how the responses were influenced by factors derived from viewing the
      videos. Moreover, YouTube videos also provide information on at least 47 new bird
      species not previously mentioned as using alcohol, and our results suggest that
      parrots in particular can be potentially good candidates for future restricted
      laboratory studies on the effect of ethanol on birds and their relationship with 
      humans.

TI  - Matched pilot study examining cannabis-based dronabinol for acute pain following 
      traumatic injury.
LID - e000391
AB  - Background: To determine whether adjunctive dronabinol, a licensed form of
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, reduces opioid consumption when used off-label for 
      managing acute pain following traumatic injury. Methods: This matched cohort
      study included patients who were admitted with a traumatic injury between 1 March
      2017 and 30 October 2017. The hospital pharmacy database was used to identify
      patients who received dronabinol (cases), and they were matched 1:1 to patients
      who did not receive dronabinol (controls) using age, cause of injury and hospital
      length of stay. The primary outcome, change in opioid consumption, was calculated
      using morphine milligram equivalents (MME). The change in MME was calculated for 
      cases as total MME over 48 hours with adjunctive dronabinol minus 48 hours prior 
      to dronabinol, and for controls as total MME 48–96 hours from admission minus
      0–48 hours from admission. Data are presented as mean and SE or median and IQR.
      Statistical analysis was performed using paired t-tests and McNemar’s tests.
      Results: There were 66 patients included: 33 cases and 33 matched controls.
      Dronabinol was initiated 55 (28–107) hours from admission. Cases and controls
      were well matched. Cases had a significant reduction in opioid consumption with
      adjunctive dronabinol (−79 (20) MME, p<0.001), while opioid consumption was
      unchanged for controls (−9 (20) MME, p=0.63). This resulted in a ninefold greater
      reduction in opioid consumption for cases versus controls that was statistically 
      different between pairs (p=0.02). Nineteen (58%) cases reported using marijuana; 
      in this subset, opioid consumption was reduced with adjunctive dronabinol (−97
      (24) MME, p<0.001) versus a non-significant increase in opioid consumption in
      matched controls (11 (29) MME, p=0.70); difference between groups, p=0.01.
      Conclusions: The results of this study suggest adjunctive dronabinol reduces
      opioid consumption following traumatic injury. The opioid-sparing effect of
      dronabinol may be greater in patients who are marijuana users. Level of evidence:
      III.

TI  - Genotoxic Properties of Synthetic Cannabinoids on TK6 Human Cells by Flow
      Cytometry.
LID - 1150
AB  - Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS) include several classes of substances such as
      synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs), an emerging alternative to marijuana, easily
      purchasable on internet. SCBs are more dangerous than Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol as 
      a consequence of their stronger affinities for the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which
      may result in longer duration of distinct effects, greater potency, and toxicity.
      The information on SCBs cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and long-term
      effects is scarce. This fact suggests the urgent need to increase available data 
      and to investigate if some SCBs have an impact on the stability of genetic
      material. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the evaluation of the
      mutagenic effect of different SCBs belonging to indole- and indazole-structures. 
      The analyzes were conducted in vitro on human TK6 cells and mutagenicity were
      measured as micronucleus fold increase by flow cytometry. Our results have
      highlighted, for the first time, the mutagenic capacity of four SCBs, in
      particular in terms of chromosomal damage induction. We underline the serious
      potential toxicity of SCBs that suggests the need to proceed with the studies of 
      other different synthetic compounds. Moreover, we identified a method that allows
      a rapid but effective screening of NPS placed on the market increasingly faster.

TI  - The Role of Dietary Antioxidants in the Pathogenesis of Neurodegenerative
      Diseases and Their Impact on Cerebral Oxidoreductive Balance.
LID - 435
AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive diseases of the nervous system that
      lead to neuron loss or functional disorders. Neurodegenerative diseases require
      long-term, sometimes life-long pharmacological treatment, which increases the
      risk of adverse effects and a negative impact of pharmaceuticals on the patients’
      general condition. One of the main problems related to the treatment of this type
      of condition is the limited ability to deliver drugs to the brain due to their
      poor solubility, low bioavailability, and the effects of the blood-brain barrier.
      Given the above, one of the main objectives of contemporary scientific research
      focuses on the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. As disorders related to 
      the competence of the antioxidative system are a marker in all diseases of this
      type, the primary prophylactics should entail the use of exogenous antioxidants, 
      particularly ones that can be used over extended periods, regardless of the
      patient’s age, and that are easily available, e.g., as part of a diet or as diet 
      supplements. The paper analyzes the significance of the oxidoreductive balance in
      the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Based on information published
      globally in the last 10 years, an analysis is also provided with regard to the
      impact of exogenous antioxidants on brain functions with respect to the
      prevention of this type of diseases.

TI  - Standardised neonatal parenteral nutrition formulations – Australasian neonatal
      parenteral nutrition consensus update 2017.
LID - 59
AB  - Background: The first consensus standardised neonatal parenteral nutrition
      formulations were implemented in many neonatal units in Australia in 2012. The
      current update involving 49 units from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore,
      Malaysia and India was conducted between September 2015 and December 2017 with
      the aim to review and update the 2012 formulations and guidelines. Methods: A
      systematic review of available evidence for each parenteral nutrient was
      undertaken and new standardised formulations and guidelines were developed.
      Results: Five existing preterm Amino acid-Dextrose formulations have been
      modified and two new concentrated Amino acid-Dextrose formulations added to
      optimise amino acid and nutrient intake according to gestation. Organic phosphate
      has replaced inorganic phosphate allowing for an increase in calcium and
      phosphate content, and acetate reduced. Lipid emulsions are unchanged, with both 
      SMOFlipid (Fresenius Kabi, Australia) and ClinOleic (Baxter Healthcare,
      Australia) preparations included. The physicochemical compatibility and stability
      of all formulations have been tested and confirmed. Guidelines to standardise the
      parenteral nutrition clinical practice across facilities have also been
      developed. Conclusions: The 2017 PN formulations and guidelines developed by the 
      2017 Neonatal Parenteral Nutrition Consensus Group offer concise and practical
      instructions to clinicians on how to implement current and up-to-date evidence
      based PN to the NICU population.

TI  - Evaluation of Pain Management after Surgery: An Observational Study.
LID - 65
AB  - Background and Objectives: Choosing a pain management strategy is essential for
      improving recovery after surgery. Effective pain management reduces the stress
      response, facilitates mobilization, and improves the quality of the postoperative
      period. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of pain management
      in patients after surgery. Materials and Methods: The study included 216 patients
      operated on in the following surgical wards: the Department of Cardiosurgery and 
      the Department of General and Endocrine Surgery. Patients were hospitalized on
      average for 6 ± 4.5 days. Patients were randomly selected for the study using a
      questionnaire technique with a numerical rating scale. Results: Immediately after
      surgery, pre-emptive analgesia, multimodal analgesia, and analgosedation were
      used significantly more frequently than other methods (p < 0.001). In the
      subsequent postoperative days, the method of administering drugs on demand was
      used most often. Patients with confirmed complications during postoperative wound
      healing required significantly more frequent use of drugs from Steps 2 and 3 of
      the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder compared with patients
      without complications. Conclusion: The mode of patient admission for surgery
      significantly affected the level of pain perception. Different pain management
      methods were used and not every method was effective.

TI  - Role of Astrocytic Dysfunction in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease Animal 
      Models from a Molecular Signaling Perspective.
LID - 1859431
AB  - Despite the fact that astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells, critical for 
      brain function, few studies have dealt with their possible role in
      neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). This article explores
      relevant evidence on the involvement of astrocytes in experimental PD
      neurodegeneration from a molecular signaling perspective. For a long time,
      astrocytic proliferation was merely considered a byproduct of neuroinflammation, 
      but by the time being, it is clear that astrocytic dysfunction plays a far more
      important role in PD pathophysiology. Indeed, ongoing experimental evidence
      suggests the importance of astrocytes and dopaminergic neurons' cross-linking
      signaling pathways. The Wnt-1 (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member
      1) pathway regulates several processes including neuron survival, synapse
      plasticity, and neurogenesis. In PD animal models, Frizzled (Fzd) neuronal
      receptors' activation by the Wnt-1 normally released by astrocytes following
      injuries leads to β-catenin-dependent gene expression, favoring neuron survival
      and viability. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) capsaicin
      receptor also participates in experimental PD genesis. Activation of astrocyte
      TRPV1 receptors by noxious stimuli results in reduced inflammatory response and
      increased ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) synthesis, which enhances neuronal
      survival and differentiation. Another major pathway involves IκB kinase (IKK)
      downregulation by ARL6ip5 (ADP-ribosylation-like factor 6 interacting protein 5, 
      encoded by the cell differentiation-associated, JWA, gene). Typically, IKK
      releases the proinflammatory NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of 
      activated B cells) molecule from its inhibitor. Therefore, by downregulating
      NF-κB inhibitor, ARL6ip5 promotes an anti-inflammatory response. The evidence
      provided by neurotoxin-induced PD animal models guarantees further research on
      the neuroprotective potential of normalizing astrocyte function in PD.

TI  - Early Neonatal Pain—A Review of Clinical and Experimental Implications on Painful
      Conditions Later in Life.
LID - 30
AB  - Modern health care has brought our society innumerable benefits but has also
      introduced the experience of pain very early in life. For example, it is now
      routine care for newborns to receive various injections or have blood drawn
      within 24 h of life. For infants who are sick or premature, the pain experiences 
      inherent in the required medical care are frequent and often severe, with
      neonates requiring intensive care admission encountering approximately fourteen
      painful procedures daily in the hospital. Given that much of the world has seen a
      steady increase in preterm births for the last several decades, an ever-growing
      number of babies experience multiple painful events before even leaving the
      hospital. These noxious events occur during a critical period of neurodevelopment
      when the nervous system is very vulnerable due to immaturity and neuroplasticity.
      Here, we provide a narrative review of the literature pertaining to the idea that
      early life pain has significant long-term effects on neurosensory, cognition,
      behavior, pain processing, and health outcomes that persist into childhood and
      even adulthood. We refer to clinical and pre-clinical studies investigating how
      early life pain impacts acute pain later in life, focusing on animal model
      correlates that have been used to better understand this relationship. Current
      knowledge around the proposed underlying mechanisms responsible for the
      long-lasting consequences of neonatal pain, its neurobiological and behavioral
      effects, and its influence on later pain states are discussed. We conclude by
      highlighting that another important consequence of early life pain may be the
      impact it has on later chronic pain states—an area of research that has received 
      little attention.

TI  - Renal insufficiency plays a crucial association factor in severe knee
      osteoarthritis-induced pain in patients with total knee replacement: A
      retrospective study.
LID - e19125
AB  - Pain, the main symptom of osteoarthritis (OA), can lead to functional disability 
      in patients with knee OA. Understanding the association factors related to knee
      pain is important since preventing OA-induced disabilities can be achieved by
      modifying these pain-associated issues. Therefore, this study was aimed to
      investigate the association factors for OA-induced knee pain in Taiwanese
      patients who received total knee replacements (TKR).In this retrospective study, 
      357 subjects who had undergone TKR at the Taipei Municipal Wan-Fang Hospital were
      recruited. The distribution of pain severity among patients with knee OA was
      evaluated. Demographic data and clinical parameters were analyzed to determine
      relationships between these variables and the severity of knee OA pain.Of the 357
      patients studied, 54% and 33% had moderate and severe knee pain, respectively.
      Furthermore, a multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that serum
      creatinine (>1.5 mg/dL) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
      (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) were significantly associated with severe knee pain in OA
      patients. A significant correlation between severe knee pain and serum creatinine
      or eGFR was demonstrated by Pearson correlations.Taken together, the renal
      insufficiency defined by an elevated serum creatinine or a low eGFR in OA
      patients who required TKR was associated with severe knee pain. These variables
      must be considered while treating knee OA pain, especially in those patients with
      severe pain.

TI  - Oxycodone preemptive analgesia after endoscopic plasma total adenotonsillectomy
      in children: A randomized controlled trial.
LID - e19004
AB  - Background:: Endoscopic tonsillectomy is associated with postoperative pain.
      Postoperative pain management remains to be improved in children. We aimed to
      investigate oxycodone preemptive analgesia in children undergoing endoscopic
      plasma total adenotonsillectomy. Methods:: 166 children with adenotonsillar
      hypertrophy were recruited at Wuhan Children's Hospital between 08/2016 and
      03/2017. They were randomly assigned to receive SPOA (postoperative sufentanil), 
      SPEA+SPOA (preemptive sufentanil and postoperative sufentanil), and OPEA+SPOA
      (preemptive oxycodone and postoperative sufentanil). The primary endpoint was
      serum c-fos levels. The secondary endpoints were the response entropy (RE) value,
      Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score, FLACC score, and adverse
      events. Results:: c-fos mRNA levels were increased significantly after surgery in
      the SPOA and SPEA+SPOA groups (P < .05). Postoperatively, c-fos mRNA levels were 
      higher in the SPOA group compared with the OPEA+SPOA group (P = .044). The RE
      values increased in all groups after surgery (P < .05). At extubation, RE values 
      were higher in the SPOA group compared with the SPEA+SPOA and OPEA+SPOA groups
      (P < .05). The PAED scores were higher in the SPOA group compared with the
      OPEA+SPOA group (P = .045). In the SPOA group, the FLACC scores were decreased at
      24 h after surgery vs 4 hours (P = .044). Prediction probability (Pk) values
      indicated that RE and c-fos mRNA levels were quantitative predictors for early
      postoperative stress reaction after surgery. Conclusions:: The subanalgesic dose 
      of oxycodone (0.1 mg/kg) as preemptive analgesia could improve pain after
      endoscopic plasma total adenotonsillectomy in children.

TI  - Left renal Ewing's sarcoma: A case study and a review of imaging literature.
PG  - 391-5
AB  - Extra-skeletal Ewing's sarcoma is among the rarest tumors in adults. The primary 
      sites of the tumor dictates symptoms and signs, thus early treatments are
      compromised when more common tumors are lined up as differentials by the
      location. We present a case of a 35-year-old pregnant female who developed a
      renal Ewing sarcoma during pregnancy. A prior simple left kidney cyst in an
      ultrasound with no tumor signs was spotted. A month after her cesarean section
      she visited a doctor when she was sent and admitted for surgery with renal cell
      carcinoma as the primary diagnosis to the Firoozgar hospital. Histology confirmed
      the final diagnosis. To this end, she completed the standard chemotherapy for the
      renal Ewing sarcoma with pulmonary metastasis when she was re-evaluated for the
      general bone pain, diagnosed with multiple bone metastases, and ultimately
      approached her palliative care. She expired after 2 months. This study
      demonstrates: a gently progressive mass; palpable in late stages; introduced rise
      in mean corpuscular volume and lactate dehydrogenase with no drop in the
      hematocrit. In conclusion, any random parenchymal and/or cortical thickening in
      primary ultrasound and/or computed tomography demonstrating a cyst—whether
      displaying internal echo or not— with suggested signs should be furtherly
      evaluated.

TI  - Applying Serum Cytokine Levels to Predict Pain Severity in Cancer Patients.
PG  - 313-21
AB  - Background and Aim: Cancers originating in the breast, lung and prostate often
      metastasize to the bone, frequently resulting in cancer-induced bone pain that
      can be challenging to manage despite conventional analgesic therapy. This
      exploratory study’s aim was to identify potential biomarkers associated with
      cancer-induced pain by examining a sample population of breast cancer patients
      undergoing bisphosphonate therapy. Methods: A secondary analysis of the primary
      study was performed to quantify serum cytokine levels for correlation to pain
      scores. Cytokines with statistically significant correlations were then input
      into a stepwise regression analysis to generate a predictive equation for a
      patient’s pain severity. In an effort to find additional potential biomarkers,
      correlation analysis was performed between these factors and a more comprehensive
      panel of cytokines and chemokines from breast, lung, and prostate cancer
      patients. Results: Statistical analysis identified nine cytokines (GM-CSF, IFNγ, 
      IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12p70, IL-17A, and IL-23) that had significant
      negative correlations with pain scores and they could best predict pain severity 
      through a predictive equation generated for this specific evaluation. After
      performing a correlation analysis between these factors and a larger panel of
      cytokines and chemokines, samples from breast, lung and prostate patients showed 
      distinct correlation profiles, highlighting the clinical challenge of applying
      pain-associated cytokines related to more defined nociceptive states, such as
      arthritis, to a cancer pain state. Conclusion: Exploratory analyses such as the
      ones presented here will be a beneficial tool to expand insights into potential
      cancer-specific nociceptive mechanisms and to develop novel therapeutics.

TI  - Opioid-Free Cesarean Section with Bilateral Quadratus Lumborum Catheters.
PG  - 17-20
AB  - Introduction: Post-operative pain control following cesarean section delivery
      (CD) is an important topic of discussion given the lack of consensus on a
      narcotic-sparing analgesic regimen. We describe the case of an elective CD with
      narcotic-free pain control using continuous bilateral posterior quadratus
      lumborum (QL) blockade as the primary mode of analgesia. Case Report: The patient
      is a 36-year-old female, G3P1, who presented at 37 weeks of gestation in active
      labor scheduled for elective primary CD. A spinal anesthetic was performed at
      L4–L5 with hyperbaric 0.75% bupivacaine, without intrathecal morphine. Bilateral 
      posterior QL catheters were placed under sterile conditions with 20 mL of 0.25%
      bupivacaine per side. Continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine was then started at
      10 mL/hour per side. The patient’s pain was controlled with QL catheters and a
      multimodal pain regimen consisting of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and
      acetaminophen. The patient reported a resting pain score of 0 with a dynamic pain
      score of 3 out of 10 throughout her recovery. She was discharged on
      post-operative (post-op) day 3 and the catheters were removed without any
      complications. Discussion: The gold standard for pain control following CD is
      intrathecal morphine; however, its use has many adverse effects. Bilateral
      single-shot QL blocks following CD have been proven to decrease opioid
      consumption but its limited duration has minimal advantage over intrathecal
      morphine and patients continue to require oral narcotics for analgesia. With the 
      use of QL catheters and a multimodal pain regimen, it may be possible to achieve 
      opioid-free CD for the post-op period.

TI  - The Antiallodynic Effect of Nefopam on Vincristine-Induced Neuropathy in Mice.
PG  - 323-9
AB  - Background: Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is a disabling condition
      following cancer treatment. Vincristine has more neurotoxicity than other vinca
      alkaloid agents. This study evaluated the correlation of different doses of
      nefopam with antiallodynic effects in a mouse vincristine neuropathy model.
      Methods: A peripheral neuropathic mouse model was made by intraperitoneal
      injection of vincristine (0.1 mg/kg/day; 5-day-on, 2-day-off schedule over 12
      days). After the development of allodynia, mice were injected intraperitoneally
      with 0.9% normal saline (NS group) or various doses (10, 30, 60 mg/kg) of nefopam
      (Nefopam group). We examined allodynia using von Frey hairs pre-administration
      and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 mins, and 24 hrs after drug administration. We
      also measured the neurokinin-1 receptor concentrations in the spinal cord to
      confirm the antiallodynic effect of nefopam after drug administration. Results:
      The peripheral neuropathic mouse model showed prominent mechanical allodynia.
      Intraperitoneal nefopam produced a clear dose-dependent increase in paw
      withdrawal threshold compared with pre-administration values and versus the NS
      group. The concentration of neurokinin-1 receptor was significantly decreased in 
      the Nefopam group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Intraperitoneally administered nefopam
      yielded a dose-dependent attenuation of mechanical allodynia and decreased
      neurokinin-1 receptor concentration, suggesting that the neurokinin-1 receptor is
      involved in the antiallodynic effects of nefopam in vincristine neuropathy.

TI  - Role of Melatonin in the Regulation of Pain.
PG  - 331-43
AB  - Melatonin is a pleiotropic hormone synthesized and secreted mainly by the pineal 
      gland in vertebrates. Melatonin is an endogenous regulator of circadian and
      seasonal rhythms. Melatonin is involved in many physiological and
      pathophysiological processes demonstrating antioxidant, antineoplastic,
      anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Accumulating evidence has
      revealed that melatonin plays an important role in pain modulation through
      multiple mechanisms. In this review, we examine recent evidence for melatonin on 
      pain regulation in various animal models and patients with pain syndromes, and
      the potential cellular mechanisms.

TI  - Countering opioid-induced respiratory depression by non-opioids that are
      respiratory stimulants.
LID - F1000 Faculty Rev-91
AB  - Strong opioid analgesics are the mainstay of therapy for the relief of moderate
      to severe acute nociceptive pain that may occur post-operatively or following
      major trauma, as well as for the management of chronic cancer-related pain.
      Opioid-related adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, sedation, respiratory
      depression, constipation, tolerance, and addiction/abuse liability. Of these,
      respiratory depression is of the most concern to clinicians owing to the
      potential for fatal consequences. In the broader community, opioid overdose due
      to either prescription or illicit opioids or co-administration with central
      nervous system depressants may evoke respiratory depression. To address this
      problem, there is ongoing interest in the identification of non-opioid
      respiratory stimulants to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression but
      without reversing opioid analgesia. Promising compound classes evaluated to date 
      include those that act on a diverse array of receptors including
      5-hydroxytryptamine, D 1-dopamine,
      α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate
      (NMDA) receptor antagonists, and nicotinic acetylcholine as well as
      phosphodiesterase inhibitors and molecules that act on potassium channels on
      oxygen-sensing cells in the carotid body. The aim of this article is to review
      recent advances in the development potential of these compounds for countering
      opioid-induced respiratory depression.

TI  - The pro- and anti-cancer effects of oxycodone are associated with epithelial
      growth factor receptor level in cancer cells.
LID - BSR20193524
AB  - Background: Oxycodone is an opioid medication used for the treatment of pain in
      cancer patients. However, little is known on the direct effects of oxycodone on
      cancer cells. Aim: To determine the effects and mechanisms of oxycodone in cancer
      cells. Materials and Methods: Proliferation, survival and migration assays were
      performed on multiple types of cancer cells. Epithelial growth factor receptor
      (EGFR)/ERK/Akt pathway and oxidative stress were investigated after oxycodone
      treatment. Results: Oxycodone can either stimulate growth and migration without
      affecting survival in MDA-468 cells or inhibit growth and survival without
      affecting migration in SKBR3 and Caco2 cells. In addition, oxycodone can either
      attenuate or stimulate efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer, depending on
      the type of cancer cells and nature of action of oxycodone as single drug alone. 
      Our mechanism studies suggest that the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of
      oxycodone are associated with EGFR expression levels in cancer cells. In cancer
      cells with high EGFR level, oxycodone activates EGFR signaling in cancer cells,
      leading to stimulatory effects in multiple biological activities, and this is
      dependent on opioid receptor. In cancer cells with low EGFR level, oxycodone
      induces mitochondria-mediated caspase activity and oxidative stress and damage,
      leading to cell death. Conclusions: Our work is the first to demonstrate
      systematic analysis of oxycodone’s effects and mechanism of action in cancer. The
      activation of EGFR signaling by oxycodone may provide a new guide in the clinical
      use of oxycodone, in particular for cancer patients with high EGFR levels.

AB  - Backgroud: Severe pneumonia is one of the most common causes for mechanical
      ventilation. We aimed to early identify severe pneumonia patients with high risk 
      of extubation failure in order to improve prognosis.Methods: From April 2014 to
      December 2015, medical records of intubated patients with severe pneumonia in
      intensive care unit were retrieved from database. Patients were divided into
      extubation success and failure groups, and multivariate logistic regressions were
      performed to identify independent predictors for extubation failure.Results: A
      total of 125 eligible patients were included, of which 82 and 43 patients had
      extubation success and failure, respectively. APACHE II score (odds ratio (OR)
      1.141, 95% confident interval (CI) 1.022–1.273, P = 0.019, cutoff at 17.5), blood
      glucose (OR 1.122, 95%CI 1.008–1.249, P = 0.035, cutoff at 9.87 mmol/l), dose of 
      fentanyl (OR 3.010, 95%CI 1.100–8.237, P = 0.032, cutoff at 1.135 mg/d), and the 
      need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (OR 2.774, 95%CI 1.062–7.252, P =
      0.037) were independent risk factors for extubation failure.Conclusion: In
      patients with severe pneumonia, APACHE II score > 17.5, blood glucose > 9.87
      mmol/l, fentanyl usage > 1.135 mg/d, and the need for RBC transfusion might be
      associated with higher risk of extubation failure.

TI  - Buprenorphine to reverse respiratory depression from methadone overdose in
      opioid-dependent patients: a prospective randomized trial.
LID - 44
AB  - Background: Naloxone is the usual drug used in opioid-induced respiratory
      depression but it has a short half-life, precipitates withdrawal in dependent
      patients, and thus for persistent reversal of long-acting opioids has to be given
      by titrated doses and infusions. The partial agonist buprenorphine has a much
      longer duration of action and causes less severe withdrawal, but still should
      largely reverse respiratory depression induced by full agonist opioids. We aimed 
      to compare the efficacy/safety of buprenorphine and naloxone in reversing
      respiratory depression in methadone-poisoned opioid-dependent patients. Methods: 
      Patients with methadone-induced respiratory depression were randomized to receive
      naloxone (titrated doses), or lower or higher doses of buprenorphine (10 μg/kg or
      15 μg/kg). The primary outcome was immediate reversal of respiratory depression. 
      We also recorded acute opioid withdrawal, need for intubation/recurrent apnea,
      repeated doses of opioid antagonists, length of hospital stay, other morbidity,
      and mortality. The study was registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical
      Trials (Trial ID: 18265; Approval code: IRCT2015011020624N1). Results:
      Eighty-five patients were randomized; 55/56 patients who received buprenorphine
      had rapid reversal of respiratory depression, which persisted for at least 12 h. 
      Naloxone was effective in 28/29 patients, but often required very high titrated
      doses (thus delaying time to respond) and prolonged infusions. Intubation (8/29
      vs 5/56) and opioid withdrawal (15/29 vs 7/56) were less common with
      buprenorphine. There were no serious complications or deaths in those receiving
      buprenorphine. The 15-μg/kg buprenorphine dose appeared to provide a longer
      duration of action, but precipitated withdrawal more frequently than the 10-μg/kg
      dose. Conclusion: Buprenorphine appears to be a safe and effective substitute for
      naloxone in overdosed opioid-dependent patients. Further studies are warranted to
      explore the optimal dosing strategy for buprenorphine to consistently maintain
      reversal of respiratory depression but not precipitate withdrawal. Trial

TI  - Comparison between local infiltration analgesia with combined femoral and sciatic
      nerve block for pain management after total knee arthroplasty.
LID - 41
AB  - Background: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is usually associated with moderate to 
      severe postoperative pain. Peripheral nerve block (PNB) and local infiltration
      analgesia (LIA) are two major methods for postoperative analgesia. Femoral nerve 
      block (FNB) leads to residual posterior knee pain; thus, currently sciatic nerve 
      block (SNB) and LIA are two major options for supplementing FNB. However, the
      efficacy and safety of LIA compared with combined femoral and sciatic nerve block
      still remain controversial. Here, we conducted a study to analyze the
      postoperative analgesic efficacy of these two methods. Method: Two hundred six
      patients undergoing TKA were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. The
      patients received either PNB or LIA. All patients in PNB group were conducted
      combined femoral and sciatic nerve block. All patients were encouraged to use
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) after surgery. The postoperative visual analog
      scale (VAS) at rest or with movement during the first 24 h and 48 h was recorded.
      We analyzed the VAS of 24 h, VAS of 48 h, opioid consumption, and adverse effects
      between PNB group and LIA group. Chi-square test and nonparametric test were used
      in this study. Results: There were 82 patients in the PNB group and 124 patients 
      in the LIA group. The patients’ characteristics such as age, height, weight, and 
      ASA showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). No significant differences were 
      found (P > 0.05) between the two groups regarding VAS score at rest or with
      movement. The LIA group had less opioid consumption than the PNB group but
      without significant difference (P > 0.05). In both groups, the most common side
      effect was nausea, and the side effects showed no significant differences between
      groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Local infiltration analgesia provided a similar
      analgesic effect and complications compared with combined femoral and sciatic
      nerve block in the short term. Considering less opioid consumption with local
      infiltration analgesia though without significant difference and its convenience,
      local infiltration analgesia provided better postoperative analgesia.

TI  - Protocol for a multi-site study of the effects of overdose prevention education
      with naloxone distribution program in Skåne County, Sweden.
LID - 49
AB  - Background: Continuously high rates of overdose deaths in Sweden led to the
      decision by the Skåne County to initiate the first regional take-home naloxone
      program in Sweden. The project aims to study the effect of overdose prevention
      education and naloxone distribution on overdose mortality in Skåne County.
      Secondary outcome measures include non-fatal overdoses and overdose-related harm 
      in the general population, as well as cohort-specific effects in study
      participants regarding overdoses, mortality and retention in naloxone program.
      Methods: Implementation of a multi-site train-the-trainer cascade model was
      launched in June 2018. Twenty four facilities, including opioid substitution
      treatment units, needle exchange programs and in-patient addiction units were
      included for the first line of start-up, aspiring to reach a majority of
      individuals at-risk within the first 6 months. Serving as self-sufficient
      naloxone hubs, these units provide training, naloxone distribution and study
      recruitment. During 3 years, questionnaires are obtained from initial training,
      follow up, every sixth month, and upon refill. Estimated sample size is 2000
      subjects. Naloxone distribution rates are reported, by each unit, every 6 months.
      Medical diagnoses, toxicological raw data and data on mortality and cause of
      death will be collected from national and regional registers, both for included
      naloxone recipients and for the general population. Data on vital status and
      treatment needs will be collected from registers of emergency and prehospital
      care. Discussion: Despite a growing body of literature on naloxone distribution, 
      studies on population effect on mortality are scarce. Most previous studies and
      reports have been uncontrolled, thus not being able to link naloxone distribution
      to survival, in relation to a comparison period. As Swedish registers present the
      opportunity to monitor individuals and entire populations over time, conditions
      for conducting systematic follow-ups in the Swedish population are good, serving 
      the opportunity to study the impact of large scale overdose prevention education 
      and naloxone distribution and thus fill the knowledge gap. Trial registration:

TI  - Pain Assessment in Hemodialysis Patients.
LID - e6903
AB  - BackgroundPain is a common complaint among hemodialysis (HD) patients; however,
      most patients are not assessed for this aspect and are not sufficiently treated. 
      In these patients, pain is reported to be associated with a range of parameters
      like increased depression and disrupted quality of life (QOL). Previously
      residual renal function (RRF) was not assessed for associations with pain. The
      primary aim of the study is to evaluate the pain frequency in the Turkish HD
      patient population. In addition, the type, origin, and severity of chronic pain, 
      the pain treatment ratio, and the relationship between pain, QOL, and RRF were
      investigated during the study.MethodsThis study included 328 HD patients. Pain
      assessment used the McGill Pain Questionnaire and neuropathic pain assessment
      used the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) scale. The
      correlation of pain and quality of life was evaluated with the Short Form 36
      (SF-36) quality of life scale.ResultsOf patients, 244 experienced pain (74.4%),
      and this pain had a neuropathic character in 61.8% of these patients. Patients
      with pain had a longer dialysis duration than those without pain (4.00
      (2.00-8.00), 3.00 (2.00-4.75), p=0.01). The most common site of pain was the
      lower extremities. Pain was observed more often among females and with increasing
      age. Only 36.4% of patients used analgesics. The quality of life of patients with
      pain was found to be lower. The incidence of pain was higher among patients
      without RRF and had more neuropathic character.ConclusionsPain is a significant
      problem for the majority of HD patients and is not effectively managed. To
      increase the quality of life of patients, the care team should regularly question
      pain symptoms, and it should be treated effectively. In this context, RRF should 
      be regularly monitored and efforts should be made to preserve it.

TI  - Where Have the Periods Gone? The Evaluation and Management of Functional
      Hypothalamic Amenorrhea.
PG  - 18-27
AB  - Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is a common cause of amenorrhea in
      adolescent girls. It is often seen in the setting of stress, weight loss, or
      excessive exercise. FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion. Patients with primary or
      secondary amenorrhea should be evaluated for other causes of amenorrhea before a 
      diagnosis of FHA can be made. The evaluation typically consists of a thorough
      history and physical examination as well as endocrinological and radiological
      investigations. FHA, if prolonged, can have significant impacts on metabolic,
      bone, cardiovascular, mental, and reproductive health. Management often involves 
      a multidisciplinary approach, with a focus on lifestyle modification. Depending
      on the severity, pharmacologic therapy may also be considered. The aim of this
      paper is to present a review on the pathophysiology, clinical findings,
      diagnosis, and management approaches of FHA in adolescent girls.

TI  - Dysmenorrhea, Endometriosis and Chronic Pelvic Pain in Adolescents.
PG  - 7-17
AB  - Most adolescents will experience discomfort during menstruation. Due to
      normalization of dysmenorrhea, there is delay to diagnosis and treatment.
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are a first line treatment. Adolescents can
      safely be offered menstrual suppression with combined hormonal contraception, and
      progestin-only options. When the above are ineffective, gonadotropin releasing
      hormone agonists with add back treatment can be considered. Transabdominal
      ultrasound is indicated when first line treatments do not improve symptoms.
      Endometriosis should be considered in adolescents who experience ongoing pain
      despite medical treatment. If laparoscopy is performed and endometriosis

LID - e033337
AB  - Objectives: The primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility of a newly developed, 
      neuroscience-based, alcohol and other drug (AOD) use prevention programme, ‘The
      Illicit Project’, in Australian older adolescents. The secondary aim is to
      investigate the impact of the programme on students’ drug literacy levels (a
      combination of knowledge, attitudes and skills). Design: A pilot study examining 
      the feasibility of The Illicit Project in Australian schools was conducted.
      Participants: Students aged 15–19 years from two secondary schools and a youth
      centre and 11 teachers and health professionals from various organisations in
      Sydney were recruited. Intervention: The intervention consisted of three 90 min
      workshops delivered by trained facilitators within a month. Primary and secondary
      measures: Students completed a drug literacy questionnaire before and after
      intervention. All participants (students, teachers and health professionals)
      completed an evaluation questionnaire postprogramme delivery. A paired-sample
      t-test and descriptive analytics were performed. Results: Students (n=169)
      demonstrated a significant increase in drug literacy levels from preintervention 
      to postintervention (t(169) = −13.22, p<0.0001). Of students evaluating the
      programme (n=252), over threequarters agreed that The Illicit Project was good or
      very good (76%), that the neuroscience content was interesting (76%) and relevant
      (81%), and that they plan to apply the concepts learnt to their own lives (80%). 
      In addition, all teachers and health professionals (n=11) agreed that the
      programme was feasible and valid for schools and perceived the programme to be
      effective in reducing the harms and use of AOD. Conclusions: There is evidence to
      suggest that The Illicit Project is credible and feasible in the school
      environment and there are preliminary data to suggest it may help to improve drug
      literacy levels in young people. A large-scale evaluation trial of the
      intervention will be conducted to determine the programme’s effectiveness in
      minimising the harms of AOD in older adolescents.

TI  - Sustained Release of Levobupivacaine, Lidocaine, and Acemetacin from
      Electrosprayed Microparticles: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.
LID - 1093
AB  - In this study, we explored the release characteristics of analgesics, namely
      levobupivacaine, lidocaine, and acemetacin, from electrosprayed
      poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles. The drug-loaded particles
      were prepared using electrospraying techniques and evaluated for their
      morphology, drug release kinetics, and pain relief activity. The morphology of
      the produced microparticles elucidated by scanning electron microscopy revealed
      that the optimal parameters for electrospraying were 9 kV, 1 mL/h, and 10 cm for 
      voltage, flow rate, and travel distance, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared
      spectrometry indicated that the analgesics had been successfully incorporated
      into the PLGA microparticles. The analgesic-loaded microparticles possessed low
      toxicity against human fibroblasts and were able to sustainably elute
      levobupivacaine, lidocaine, and acemetacin in vitro. Furthermore, electrosprayed 
      microparticles were found to release high levels of lidocaine and acemetacin
      (well over the minimum therapeutic concentrations) and levobupivacaine at the
      fracture site of rats for more than 28 days and 12 days, respectively.
      Analgesic-loaded microparticles demonstrated their effectiveness and sustained
      performance for pain relief in fracture injuries.

TI  - Levetiracetam Improves Upper Limb Spasticity in a Patient With Unresponsive
      Wakefulness Syndrome: A Case Report.
LID - 70
AB  - Severe spasticity is a frequent and disabling complication in patients presenting
      disorders of consciousness (DOC) that hinders their rehabilitative process, and
      is strongly correlated with pain reducing patients’ quality of life. In these
      patients, abnormal postures may occur as an expression of severe brain damage.
      Here we present the case of a 52-year-old man in decorticate rigidity following a
      hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy due to myocardial infarction who showed
      improvement of spasticity of upper limbs following intake of levetiracetam
      combined with the conventional neurorehabilitation program.

TI  - Evaluation of Endotracheal Tube Cuff Pressure and the Use of Three Cuff Inflation
      Syringe Devices in Dogs.
LID - 39
AB  - Over-inflation of an endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff may lead to tracheal mucosal
      irritation, tracheal wall ischemia or necrosis, whereas under-inflation increases
      the risk of pulmonary aspiration as well as leaking anesthetic gas and polluting 
      the environment. The objectives of this two-phase study were to (1) identify the 
      incidence of improper ETT cuff inflation (both over- and under-inflation) using
      the minimum occlusive volume (MOV) technique coupled with a regular injectable
      syringe in the anesthetized dogs, and (2) evaluate the performance of two
      commercially available inflation syringe devices (Tru-Cuff and AG Cuffill®) with 
      the regular injectable syringe in inflating the ETT cuff to a recommended safe
      cuff pressure range (20–30 cmH2O). Dogs undergoing general anesthesia at Purdue
      Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital were included. The ETT cuff pressure was
      assessed with an aneroid manometer after the syringe inflation. The results of
      the first objective showed that a total of 80 dogs enrolled and that 50 of these 
      80 dogs required ETT cuff inflation. Among the 50 dogs, only 14% had proper ETT
      cuff inflation; 76% of the ETT cuffs were over-inflated and 10% were
      under-inflated. Ninety dogs were enrolled for the second objective study and they
      were randomly and equally assigned to the three syringe device treatment groups. 
      The results showed that 80% of the ETT cuffs were over-inflated in the regular
      injectable syringe treatment group, whereas only 6.7% and 3.3% ETT cuffs were
      over-inflated in the Tru-Cuff and AG Cuffill® syringe treatment groups,
      respectively. The AG Cuffill® syringe treatment group had a significantly (p <
      0.05) higher percentage of properly inflated ETT cuffs (86.7%) compared to the
      other two groups (regular injectable syringe [3.3%]; Tru-Cuff syringe [50%]. We
      concluded that there was a high incidence of improper ETT cuff inflation when
      using MOV technique coupled with a regular injectable syringe. The use of an AG
      Cuffill® syringe significantly reduced improper ETT cuff inflation.

TI  - Paired mechanical and electrical acupuncture of neurogenic spots induces
      opioid-mediated suppression of hypertension in rats.
LID - 14
AB  - While our recent studies have suggested that effective acupoints display
      neurogenic inflammation and can be identified as neurogenic spots (Neuro-Sps),
      the optimal stimulation conditions and the underlying mechanisms remain
      uncharacterized. We developed a combined mechano-electrical acupuncture device
      (MEA) and examined the effects of acupuncture at Neuro-Sps on systolic blood
      pressure (BP) in a rat model of immobilization-induced hypertension (IMH) and the
      mediation of endogenous opioid systems in its effect. Cutaneous neurogenic spots 
      were found mostly in the forelimb. Electrical and mechanical acupuncture of
      Neuro-Sps increased 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), c-Fos expression and 
      cell excitability in the midbrain and synergistically alleviated the development 
      of hypertension following immobilization stress, which was prevented by
      administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone into the rostral ventrolateral
      medulla (rVLM). These findings suggest that mechanical and electrical stimulation
      at Neuro-Sps suppresses the development of hypertension via mediation of the
      endogenous opioid system.

TI  - Interaction effects in the association between methadone maintenance therapy and 
      experiences of racial discrimination in U.S. healthcare settings.
LID - e0228755
AB  - Background: Disparities in methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) outcomes have
      received limited attention, but there are important negative outcomes associated 
      with MMT that warrant investigation. Racial discrimination is common in
      healthcare settings and affects opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and
      comorbidities. However, race/ethnicity alone may not fully explain experiences of
      discrimination. MMT remains highly stigmatized and may compound the effect of
      race/ethnicity on discrimination in healthcare settings. We sought to quantify
      differential associations between MMT and experiences of racial discrimination
      between racial/ethnic groups in a U.S. national sample. Methods: We used the
      National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (2012–2013)
      to identify a subset of individuals with a lifetime OUD who had ever used MMT
      (survey n = 766; weighted population n = 5,276,507). We used multivariable
      logistic regression to model past-year experience of racial discrimination in a
      healthcare setting. We included an interaction term between race/ethnicity and
      MMT status to identify the odds of discrimination (MMT vs. no MMT [referent])
      within racial/ethnic groups. We used survey procedures with weights to account
      for the parent study’s complex survey design. Findings: Twenty-two percent of our
      sample experienced racial discrimination in a healthcare setting in the past
      year. Discrimination was more common among those who had ever used MMT (x2 =
      10.00, p = 0.001) and racial/ethnic minorities (x2 = 23.15, p<0.001). The
      interaction effect was much stronger than the main effects of race/ethnicity and 
      MMT status. MMT status (versus no MMT) was positively associated with
      discrimination among Blacks (aOR = 3.93, 95% CI = 3.87–3.98, p<0.001), Whites
      (aOR = 2.25, 95% CI = 2.23–2.27, p<0.001), and Latino/Latinas (aOR = 1.59, 95% CI
      = 1.55–1.62, p<0.001). Among American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), those who
      had used MMT had over thirty times the odds of racial discrimination, compared to
      their non-MMT counterparts (aOR = 32.78, 95% CI = 31.16–34.48, p<0.001).
      Conclusion: Race/ethnicity alone did not sufficiently account for racial
      discrimination in healthcare settings among those with a lifetime OUD. MMT status
      was strongly associated with racial discrimination among AI/AN. Our strong
      interaction effect is indicative of an additional barrier to health services
      utilization among AI/AN, which has important implications for OUD treatment
      outcomes and comorbidities. Health promotion programs aimed at increased adoption
      of MMT are promising, but should be considered in the context of racial/ethnic
      disparities, drug use and MMT stigma, and implicit biases in clinical settings.

      included demographics and opioid prescriptions from prescription drug monitoring 
      programs. Preoperative and postoperative opioid dependence was defined as
      continuous opioid prescriptions for at least 3 months prior to or after surgery. 
      Statistical analyses and odds ratio analyses were performed. Results: Of the 752 
      patients in total, 241 (32%) became or remained postoperatively dependent whereas
      68% (511) were able to wean off of opioids by 3 months. In the preoperatively
      dependent cohort, only 27% were able to wean off opioids at 1 month and 53%, by 3
      months postoperatively. Odds ratio calculations showed that patients with
      preoperative opioid use had a 3.52 (95% confidence interval, 2.433-5.089) times
      increased risk of postoperative dependence compared with opioid-naive patients.
      Of those receiving postoperative opioid refills, 69% were provided these refills 
      by their orthopedic surgeons. Discussion and conclusions: Although the majority
      of TSA patients weaned off of opioids after surgery, our results demonstrate a
      3.5 times higher risk of postoperative dependence in patients who used
      preoperative opioids. Orthopedists were major contributors to continued
      postoperative opioid use, and increased efforts to minimize opioid prescriptions 
      before, during, and after TSA may help curtail overuse and dependence. These
      results highlight the hazard that preoperative opioid use entails for shoulder
      arthritis patients.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided superficial cervical plexus block for analgesia in patients
      undergoing craniotomy via suboccipital retrosigmoid approach: study protocol of a
      randomised controlled trial.
LID - e034003
AB  - Introduction: Scalp nerve block has been proven to be an alternative choice to
      opioids in multimodal analgesia. However, for the infratentorial space-occupying 
      craniotomy, especially the suboccipital retrosigmoid craniotomy, scalp nerve
      block is insufficient. Methods and analysis: The study is a prospective,
      single-centre, randomised, paralleled-group controlled trial. Patients scheduled 
      to receive elective suboccipital retrosigmoid craniotomy will be randomly
      assigned to the superficial cervical plexus block group or the control group.
      After anaesthesia induction, superficial cervical plexus nerve block will be
      performed under the guidance of ultrasound. The primary outcome is the cumulative
      consumption of sufentanil by the patient-controlled intravenous analgesia pump
      within 24 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes include the cumulative
      consumption of sufentanil at other four time points and numerical rating scale
      pain severity score. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol (version number: 2.0,
      10 April 2019) has been approved by the Ethics Review Committee of China
      Registered Clinical Trials (Ethics Review No. ChiECRCT-20190047). The findings of
      this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific
      conferences. Trial registration number: NCT04036812

TI  - Technology-Based Substance Use Interventions: Opportunities for
      Gender-Transformative Health Promotion.
LID - 992
AB  - Drawing on data from a scoping review on sex, gender and substance use, this
      narrative review explores the use of gender-informed and technology-based
      approaches in substance use prevention and health promotion interventions. With
      an ever-changing landscape of new technological developments, an understanding of
      how technology-based interventions can address sex, gender, and intersecting
      equity considerations related to substance use is warranted. Current
      technology-based approaches to substance use prevention and health promotion are 
      described and assessed for gender-specific and gender transformative outcomes,
      and limitations are discussed related to inclusivity, access, confidentiality,
      and a dearth of research on technological approaches that integrate gender-based 
      analysis. A call for action designed to advance technology-based health
      promotion, prevention and brief interventions that address gender equity
      simultaneously with substance use is proposed.

TI  - Role of β-Caryophyllene in the Antinociceptive and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of
      Tagetes lucida Cav. Essential Oil.
LID - 675
AB  - Tagetes lucida Cav. (Asteraceae) is an ancient medicinal plant commonly used to
      alleviate pain. Nevertheless, scientific studies validating this property are
      lacking in the literature. Animal models of pain were used to evaluate the
      antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of T. lucida essential oil
      (TLEO) and a bioactive metabolite. The chemical constitution and possible
      toxicity of the extract and the mechanism of action of β-caryophyllene were also 
      explored. Temporal course curves and dose–response graphics were generated using 
      TLEO (0.1–10 mg/kg or 3.16–31.62 mg/kg) and β-caryophyllene (3.16–10 mg/kg).
      Metamizole (80 mg/kg) and indomethacin (20 mg/kg) were used as reference drugs in
      the formalin assay and writhing test in rats and mice, respectively. The
      β-caryophyllene mechanism of action was explored in the presence of naloxone (1
      mg/kg), flumazenil (10 mg/kg), WAY100635 (0.16 mg/kg), or nitro-l-arginine methyl
      ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg) in the formalin test in rats. GC/MS analysis
      demonstrated the presence of geranyl acetate (49.89%), geraniol (7.92%), and
      β-caryophyllene (6.27%). Significant and dose-dependent antinociceptive response 
      was produced by TLEO and β-caryophyllene without the presence of gastric damage. 
      In conclusion, β-caryophyllene was confirmed as a bioactive compound in the T.
      lucida analgesic properties by involving the participation of receptors like
      opioids, benzodiazepines, and Serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A), as well as nitric
      oxide.

TI  - Imagined Examples of Painful Experiences Provided by Chronic Low Back Pain
      Patients and Attributed a Pain Numerical Rating Score.
LID - 1331
AB  - Objective: The pain numerical rating scale (NRS) is widely used in pain research 
      and clinical settings to represent pain intensity. For an individual with chronic
      pain, NRS reporting requires representation of a complex subjective state as a
      numeral. To evaluate the process of NRS reporting, this study examined the
      relationship between reported pain NRS levels and imagined painful events
      reported by study subjects. Design: A total of 149 subjects with chronic low back
      pain characterized by the NIH Research Task Force Recommended Minimal Dataset
      reported current pain NRS and provided imagined examples of painful experiences
      also attributing to these an NRS. We present a quantitative and qualitative
      analysis of the 797 pain examples provided by the study subjects. Results: Study 
      subjects tended to be able to imagine both highly painful 10/10 events and
      non-painful events with relative agreement across subjects. While NRS for the
      pain examples tended to increase with example severity, for many types of
      examples there was wide dispersion around the mean pain level. Examination of
      pain examples indicated unexpected relationships between current pain and the
      intensity and nature of the imagined painful events. Conclusions: Our results
      indicate that the pain NRS does not provide a reliably interpretable assessment
      of current physical pain intensity for an individual with chronic pain at a
      specific moment.

      Buprenorphine/Naloxone Maintenance Therapy: Avoiding Opioids in Patients at Risk 
      for Relapse.
PG  - 295-9
AB  - The opioid crisis in the United States has been pandemic. As such, anesthesia
      providers are frequently faced with patients who have a history of opioid abuse
      or are currently receiving chronic therapy for such disorders. The chronic
      administration of medications such as buprenorphine-naloxone can impact the
      choice of perioperative anesthesia and pain control. Furthermore, the
      postoperative administration of opioids may lead to relapse in patients with a
      history of opioid abuse. We present a 26-year-old male with a history of opioid
      abuse on maintenance therapy with buprenorphine-naloxone, who presented for
      median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and pulmonary valve replacement. The
      perioperative implications of buprenorphine-naloxone and implementation of
      multimodal analgesia are discussed, along with options to decrease or eliminate
      the perioperative use of opioids.

      randomized controlled trials.
LID - 39
AB  - Background: The comparative efficacy of epidural bupivacaine alone and
      bupivacaine combined with magnesium sulfate in providing postoperative analgesia 
      remains controversial. Methods: We searched Mediline (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP)
      and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to identify trials
      that compared epidural bupivacaine and magnesium sulfate combination
      (intervention) with bupivacaine alone (control). Grading of Recommendations,
      Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework was used to assess the 
      quality of evidence. Results: Eleven studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria
      after screening. We found that epidural bupivacaine combined with magnesium
      sulfate could prolong the time for first rescue analgesics (SMD 4.96; 95% CI
      [2.75, 7.17], P < 0.00001, I2 = 98%), reduce the number of patients who need
      rescue analgesics (RR 0.38; 95% CI [0.20, 0.74], P = 0.004, I2 = 75%) and
      requirement for rescue analgesics (SMD -2.65; 95% CI [− 4.23, − 1.06], P = 0.001,
      I2 = 96%). Conclusions: Magnesium suifate as an adjuvant of epidural bupivacaine 
      improved postoperative analgesia. However, we rated the quality of evidence to be
      very low because of high heterogeneity, imprecise of results and small sample
      sizes. Furthermore, further large high-quality trials are still needed to confirm
      the effects of magnesium sulfate on postoperative analgesia.

      analgesia after single-port VATS in Chinese population.
LID - 38
AB  - Background: Postoperative inadequate analgesia following video-assisted
      thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a common and significant clinical problem. While 
      genetic polymorphisms may play role in the variability of postoperative analgesia
      effect, few studies have evaluated the associations between genetic mutations and
      inadequate analgesia after single-port VATS. Methods: Twenty-eight single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 18 selected genes involved in pain
      perception and modulation were genotyped in 198 Chinese patients undergoing
      single-port VATS. The primary outcome was the occurrence of inadequate analgesia 
      in the first night and morning after surgery which was defined by a comprehensive
      postoperative evaluation. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to
      identify the association between genetic variations and postoperative inadequate 
      analgesia. Results: The prevalence of postoperative inadequate analgesia was
      45.5% in the present study. After controlling for age and education level,
      association with inadequate analgesia was observed in four SNPs among three genes
      encoding voltage-gated sodium channels. Patients with the minor allele of
      rs33985936 (SCN11A), rs6795970 (SCN10A), and 3312G > T (SCN9A) have an increased 
      risk of suffering from inadequate analgesia. While the patients carrying the
      minor allele of rs11709492 (SCN11A) have lower risk experiencing inadequate
      analgesia. Conclusions: We identified that SNPs in SCN9A, SCN10A, and SCN11A play
      a role in the postoperative inadequate analgesia after single-port VATS. Although
      future larger and long-term follow up studies are warranted to confirm our
      findings, the results of the current study may be utilized as predictors for
      forecasting postoperative analgesic effect for patients receiving this type of
      surgery. Trial registration: This study was retrospectively registered in the
      ClinicalTrials.gov Registry (NCT03916120) on April 16, 2019.

TI  - Anterior quadratus lumborum block for postoperative recovery after total hip
      arthroplasty: a study protocol for a single-center, double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial.
LID - 142
AB  - Background: Appropriate pain management is essential to improve the postoperative
      recovery after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Various case reports have indicated 
      that anterior quadratus lumborum block (QLB) provides effective postoperative
      analgesia in lower limb surgeries. However, few randomized controlled trials have
      confirmed the efficacy of anterior QLB for lower limb surgeries. The aim of this 
      single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial is to confirm the
      efficacy of anterior QLB for postoperative recovery after THA. Methods: The
      participants will be randomly assigned to either the anterior QLB or placebo
      groups, using a set of random numbers for the allocation sequence. Only
      pharmacists will be aware of the allocations; other investigators will be blinded
      until study completion. After induction of general anesthesia, anterior QLB will 
      be performed by using 0.25% levobupivacaine or normal saline. Fentanyl will be
      administered according to blood pressure change during the surgery. The primary
      outcome will be the quality of recovery 40 score (QoR-40). Secondary outcomes
      will include the visual analog scale score of pain intensity at rest and
      movement, intraoperative and postoperative doses of fentanyl, and incidence of
      postoperative nausea and vomiting. Statistical analysis will be performed by
      using the Student’s t test, Mann–Whitney U test, and Fisher’s exact test as
      appropriate. A P value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant. Discussion: The results of our study will reveal whether anterior
      QLB is effective for postoperative recovery after THA. Trial registration: UMIN
      Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000032255. Registered on 15 April 2018.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of selective COX-2 inhibitors for postoperative pain
      management in patients after total knee/hip arthroplasty: a meta-analysis.
LID - 39
AB  - Background: Many selective cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors are currently used
      in clinical practice. COX-2 inhibitors have good anti-inflammatory, analgesic,
      antipyretic effects, and gastrointestinal safety. However, the analgesic effects 
      and adverse reactions of COX-2 after total knee/hip arthroplasty (TKA/THA) are
      not fully known. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of selective
      COX-2 inhibitors in postoperative pain management in patients receiving TKA/THA. 
      Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved from medical
      literature databases. Risk ratios (RR) Std mean difference (SMD) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to analyze the primary and safety
      endpoints. Results: In total, 18 articles (23 trial comparisons) were retrieved
      comprising 3104 patients. Among them, 1910 patients (61.5%) were randomized to
      the experimental group whereas 1194 patients (38.5%) were randomized to the
      control group. The primary endpoints were the patients’ VAS score at rest or on
      ambulation (within 3 days). We found that VAS score in patients that received
      selective COX-2 inhibitor was significantly lower compared to those of the
      control group. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that selective COX-2
      inhibitor therapy is effective, safe, and reliable in relieving postoperative
      pain of THA/TKA.

TI  - Airway Pressure Release Ventilation: A Review of the Evidence, Theoretical
      Benefits, and Alternative Titration Strategies.
LID - 1179548420903297
AB  - Objective:: To review the theoretical benefits of airway pressure release
      ventilation (APRV), summarize the evidence for its use in clinical practice, and 
      discuss different titration strategies. Data Source:: Published randomized
      controlled trials in humans, observational human studies, animal studies, review 
      articles, ventilator textbooks, and editorials. Data Summary:: Airway pressure
      release ventilation optimizes alveolar recruitment, reduces airway pressures,
      allows for spontaneous breathing, and offers many hemodynamic benefits. Despite
      these physiologic advantages, there are inconsistent data to support the use of
      APRV over other modes of ventilation. There is considerable heterogeneity in the 
      application of APRV among providers and a shortage of information describing
      initiation and titration strategies. To date, no direct comparison studies of
      APRV strategies have been performed. This review describes 2 common management
      approaches that bedside providers can use to optimally tailor APRV to their
      patients. Conclusion:: Airway pressure release ventilation remains a form of
      mechanical ventilation primarily used for refractory hypoxemia. It offers unique 
      physiological advantages over other ventilatory modes, and providers must be
      familiar with different titration methods. Given its inconsistent outcome data
      and heterogeneous use in practice, future trials should directly compare APRV
      strategies to determine the optimal management approach.

TI  - A logistic regression analysis comparing minimalistic approach and intubation
      anaesthesia in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve
      replacement.
LID - e0227345
AB  - Aims: Patients with postoperative delirium (POD) after transcatheter aortic valve
      replacement (TAVR) are ventilated and hospitalized longer and suffer increased
      in-hospital mortality. This study hypothesized that a minimalistic approach with 
      conscious sedation during transfemoral aortic valve replacement (TF-AVR) protects
      against delirium, time of mechanical ventilation, and increased length of stay in
      intensive care unit (ICU) compared to intubation anaesthesia. Methods and
      results: 308 patients which underwent TF-AVR in our centre between 01/2013 and
      08/2017 were retrospectively evaluated regarding postoperative delirium, time of 
      mechanical ventilation, and days in ICU. TF-AVR was performed with intubation
      anaesthesia in 245 patients and with conscious sedation in 63. The operative risk
      estimated by the logEUROScore was similar in both groups (intubation: 13.28
      +/-9.06%, conscious sedation: 12.24 +/-6.77%, p = 0.395). In the conscious
      sedation group procedure duration was shorter (0.61 +/-0.91h vs. 1.75 +/-0.96h,
      p<0.001). The risk for intraprocedural complications was not influenced by the
      anaesthesia method (OR conscious sedation instead of intubation 1.66, p = 0.117),
      but days on ICU (-2.21 days, p<0.0001) and minutes of mechanical ventilation
      (-531.2 min, p < 0.0001) were reduced. Furthermore, the risk of POD was decreased
      when TF-AVR was performed under conscious sedation (6.35% vs. 18.18%, OR 0.29, p 
      = 0.021). Conclusions: Time of mechanical ventilation, risk of POD, and days on
      ICU were substantially reduced in patients who underwent TF-AVR under conscious
      sedation. Our data suggest that TF-AVR with conscious sedation is safe with a
      beneficial postoperative course in clinical practice, and should be considered
      the favoured approach.

TI  - Comparison of Biochemical Recurrence After Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical
      Prostatectomy with Volatile and Total Intravenous Anesthesia.
PG  - 449-56
AB  - Aims: Recurrence after cancer surgery is a major concern in patients with cancer.
      Growing evidence from preclinical studies has revealed that various anesthetics
      can influence the immune system in different ways. The current study compared the
      long-term biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after robot-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) in terms of selection of anesthetic
      agent between total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol/remifentanil and 
      volatile anesthetics (VA) with sevoflurane or desflurane/remifentanil.Methods: We
      followed up oncologic outcomes of patients who underwent RALP from two previous
      prospective randomized controlled trials, and the outcomes of those who received 
      TIVA (n = 64) were compared with those who received VA (n = 64). The follow-up
      period lasted from November 2010 to March 2019.Results: Both TIVA and VA groups
      showed identical biochemical recurrence-free survivals at all-time points after
      RALP. The following predictive factors of prostate cancer recurrence were
      determined by Cox regression: colloid input [hazard ratio (HR)=1.002, 95%
      confidence interval (CI): 1.000-1.003; P = 0.011], initial prostate-specific
      antigen level (HR=1.025, 95% CI: 1.007-1.044; P = 0.006), and pathological tumor 
      stage 3b (HR=4.217, 95% CI:1.207-14.735; P = 0.024), but not the anesthetic
      agent.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that both TIVA with
      propofol/remifentanil and VA with sevoflurane or desflurane/remifentanil have
      comparable effects on oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing RALP.

LID - e000603
AB  - Breathlessness is among the most common and deteriorating symptoms in patients
      with advanced cancer, which may worsen towards the end of life. Breathlessness in
      patients with estimated life expectancy of weeks to days has unique clinical
      features: it tends to worsen rapidly over days to hours as death approaches often
      despite current symptom control measures. Breathlessness in patients during the
      last weeks to days of life can be called ‘terminal breathlessness’. While
      evidence has accumulated for the management of breathlessness in patients with
      cancer who are not dying, such evidence may not be fully applied to terminal
      breathlessness. Only a few studies have investigated the best practice of
      terminal breathlessness in patients with cancer. In this paper, we summarise the 
      current evidence for the management of terminal breathlessness, and propose
      future directions of clinical research.

TI  - Vocal Music Therapy for Chronic Pain: A Mixed Methods Feasibility Study.
PG  - 113-22
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and
      preliminary effects of a vocal music therapy (VMT) program on chronic pain
      management.Design: A mixed methods intervention design was used in which
      qualitative data were embedded within a randomized controlled trial.Setting: An
      urban nurse-management health center on the East Coast of the United
      States.Subjects: Participants (N = 43) were predominantly Black (79%) and female 
      (76.7%) with an average pain duration of 10 years.Intervention: Participants were
      randomly allocated to a 12-week VMT program or a waitlist control.Outcome
      measures: We tracked consent rate (percentage of participants enrolled out of
      total number screened), attrition rate, and treatment adherence. We used PROMIS® 
      (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) tools to measure pain 
      interference, pain-related self-efficacy, pain intensity, depression, anxiety,
      positive effect, and well-being, ability to participate in social activities, and
      satisfaction with social roles at baseline and week 12. VMT participants also
      completed the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale. We conducted
      semistructured interviews to better understand participants' experience of the
      intervention.Results: The consent rate was 56%. The attrition rate was 23%. Large
      treatment effects (partial eta squared) were obtained for self-efficacy (0.20),
      depression (0.26), and ability to participate in social activities (0.24). Medium
      effects were found for pain intensity (0.10), anxiety (0.06), positive effect,
      and well-being (0.06), and small effects for pain interference (0.03) and
      satisfaction with social roles (0.03). On average, participants felt moderately
      better after completion of the VMT program (M = 4.93, standard deviation = 1.98).
      Qualitative findings suggest that VMT resulted in better self-management of pain,
      enhanced psychological well-being, and stronger social and spiritual
      connections.Conclusions: Recruitment into the 12-week program was challenging,
      but quantitative and qualitative findings suggest significant benefits of VMT for
      chronic pain management.

TI  - Gender Norms, Roles and Relations and Cannabis-Use Patterns: A Scoping Review.
LID - 947
AB  - Currently, boys and men use cannabis at higher rates than girls and women, but
      the gender gap is narrowing. With the legalization of recreational cannabis use
      in Canada and in multiple US states, these trends call for urgent attention to
      the need to consider how gender norms, roles and relations influence patterns of 
      cannabis use to inform health promotion and prevention responses. Based on a
      scoping review on sex, gender and cannabis use, this article consolidates
      existing evidence from the academic literature on how gender norms, roles and
      relations impact cannabis-use patterns. Evidence is reviewed on: adherence to
      dominant masculine and feminine norms and cannabis-use patterns among adolescents
      and young adults, and how prevailing norms can be both reinstated or reimagined
      through cannabis use; gendered social dynamics in cannabis-use settings; and the 
      impact of gender roles and relations on cannabis use among young adults of
      diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. Findings from the review are
      compared and contrasted with evidence on gender norms, roles and relations in the
      context of alcohol and tobacco use. Recommendations for integrating gender
      transformative principles in health promotion and prevention responses to
      cannabis use are provided.

TI  - “Dr. Google, I am in Pain”—Global Internet Searches Associated with Pain: A
      Retrospective Analysis of Google Trends Data.
LID - 954
AB  - We aimed to rank the most common locations of pain among Google users globally
      and locally and analyze secular and seasonal trends in pain-related searches in
      the years 2004–2019. We used data generated by Google Trends (GT) to identify and
      analyze global interest in topics (n = 24) related to locations of pain and how
      these progressed over time. We analyzed secular trends and time series
      decomposition to identify seasonal variations. We also calculated the interest in
      all topics with reference to the relative search volume (RSV) of “Abdominal
      pain”. Google users were most commonly interested in “Headache” (1.30 [times more
      frequently than “Abdominal pain”]), “Abdominal pain” (1.00), and “Back pain”
      (0.84). “Headache” was the most frequent search term in n = 41 countries, while
      “Abdominal pain” was the most frequent term in n = 27 countries. The interest in 
      all pain-related topics except “Dyspareunia” increased over time. The sharpest
      increase was observed for “Abdominal pain” (5.67 RSV/year), and “Toothache” (5.52
      RSV/year). Most of the topics revealed seasonal variations. Among pain-related
      topics, “Headache,” “Abdominal pain,” and “Back pain” interested most Google
      users. GT is a novel tool that allows retrospective investigation of complaints
      among Internet users.

TI  - Outcomes of intrathecal analgesia in multiparous women undergoing normal vaginal 
      delivery: A randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 109-17
AB  - Background and Aims:: Although intrathecal analgesia is an effective option
      during labour, there is a need to establish sustainable and assured analgesia
      during the entire labour process. We aimed to assess the effect of adding
      dexmedetomidine, fentanyl or morphine to low-dose bupivacaine-dexamethasone for
      intrathecal labour analgesia in multiparous women. Methods:: This was a
      triple-blind, randomised controlled trial that included 140 multiparous women.
      Eligible women were randomly allocated to have intrathecal
      bupivacaine-dexamethasone with dexmedetomidine (group D), fentanyl (group F),
      morphine (group M) or saline (placebo) (group C). The duration of analgesia,
      intrathecal block characteristics and maternal and foetal outcomes were assessed 
      and analysed. Results:: The longest analgesia duration and S1 regression time was
      recorded in group D followed by groups M, F and C, respectively, with statistical
      significance between all of them (P < 0.001). The shortest analgesia onset time
      and the highest sensory levels were recorded in group D followed by group F then 
      group M with statistical significance between all of them (P < 0.001 and 0.003,
      respectively). Visual analogue scale values were comparable among groups M, F and
      D (P > 0.05) at most of the measurement time points and at the peak of the last
      uterine contraction before delivery while being significantly lower than those in
      group C (P < 0.001). However, there were similar motor block characteristics and 
      normal neonatal outcomes in all groups. Conclusion:: In comparison to morphine
      and fentanyl, dexmedetomidine addition to intrathecal bupivacaine-dexamethasone
      significantly prolonged the duration and accelerated the onset of labour
      analgesia, with a good maternal and neonatal outcome.

TI  - Haemodynamic and analgesic control in a perioperative opioid-free approach to
      bariatric surgery – A case report.
PG  - 141-4
AB  - New approaches to bariatric surgery aim to achieve stress-free anaesthesia with
      sympathetic stability to protect organs and provide sufficient tissue perfusion, 
      analgesia and rapid emergence. Opioid-free and multimodal approaches to
      anaesthesia provide intra- and post-operative sedation and analgesia,
      particularly advantageous in morbidly obese patients, but their feasibility and
      efficacy are still disputed. We describe the case of a female patient proposed
      for laparoscopic bariatric surgery, conducted under an opioid-free anaesthesia
      protocol, the haemodynamic, ventilatory and analgesic control, and intra- and
      post-operative monitoring and complications.

TI  - Erector spinae plane block for complete surgical anaesthesia and postoperative
      analgesia for breast surgeries: A prospective feasibility study of 30 cases.
PG  - 118-24
AB  - Background and Aims:: Several regional anaesthesia techniques have been described
      for carcinoma of the breast surgeries in the past but all of them failed to
      provide adequate surgical anaesthesia and are associated with multiple
      complications, thus limiting their use. This prospective study was designed to
      assess the efficacy of erector spinae plane (ESP) block to provide complete
      surgical anaesthesia without general anaesthesia (GA) and postoperative analgesia
      in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) surgery. Methods::
      Thirty females of the American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I,
      II or III scheduled for MRM were included in the study to receive unilateral
      ultrasound-guided ESP block preoperatively (25 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with
      dexamethasone 8 mg on the operating side). The primary objective of the study was
      to evaluate the efficacy of ESP block to provide complete surgical anaesthesia in
      terms of total number of cases converted to GA. Results:: Our study shows that
      ultrasound-guided single-shot ESP block provided complete surgical anaesthesia in
      all the patients within an average of 31.50 minutes and an average long-lasting
      postoperative analgesia of 41.73 hours following MRM. Conclusion:: Our study
      proves that ESP block is a novel, predictable, secure, and safe option for
      carcinoma of the breast surgery. Thus, ESP block would surely provide a clinical 
      advantage in these population group.

TI  - Effects of Labor Epidural Analgesia on Short Term Neonatal Morbidity.
PG  - 59-70
AB  - Background: Epidural Analgesia (EA) is the most effective and most commonly used 
      method for pain relief during labor. Some researchers have observed an
      association between EA and increased neonatal morbidity. But this observation was
      not consistent in many other studies. Objectives: The primary objective of the
      study was to examine whether exposure to epidural analgesia increased the risk of
      NICU admission. The secondary objectives included the risks of clinical
      chorioamnionitis, instrumental delivery, neonatal depression, respiratory
      distress, birth trauma, and neonatal seizure during the first 24 hours of life.
      Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study involving 2360 low-risk
      nulliparous women who delivered at AWH, Qatar, during the two years between
      January 2016 December and 2017. Short-term neonatal outcomes of the mothers who
      received EA in active labor were compared with a similar population who did not
      receive EA. As secondary objectives, labor parameters like maternal temperature
      elevation, duration of the second stage of labor, and instrumental delivery were 
      compared. Results: Significantly higher numbers of neonates were admitted to the 
      NICU from the EA group (P<0.001, OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.46). They were more
      likely to have respiratory distress (P=0.01, OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.07), birth
      injuries (P=0.02, OR =1.71, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.74), admission temperature>37.5 °C
      (P=0.04, OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 11.49), need for oxygen on the first day
      (P=0.04, OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.07) and receive antibiotics (P<0.001, OR
      2.06,95% CI 1.47 to 2.79). There was no difference in the Apgar score at 1 minute
      (P=0.12), need of resuscitation at birth (P=0.05), neonatal white cell count
      (P=0.34), platelet count (P=0.38) and C reactive protein (P=0.84). Mothers who
      received EA had a lengthier second stage (P<0.001), temperature elevation >37.5°C
      (P<0.001, OR 7.40, 95% CI 3.93 to 13.69) and instrumental delivery (P<0.001, OR
      2.13, 95% CI 1.69 to 2.68). Conclusion: EA increases NICU admission, antibiotic
      exposure, neonatal birth injuries, need for positive pressure ventilation at
      birth, and respiratory distress in the first 24 hours of life. Mothers on
      epidural analgesia have prolonged second stage of labor, a higher rate of
      instrumental delivery, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, fetal distress, and
      temperature elevation.

TI  - Wrist–ankle acupuncture attenuates cancer-induced bone pain by regulating
      descending pain-modulating system in a rat model.
LID - 13
AB  - Background: Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) presents a multiple-mechanism of
      chronic pain involving both inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and its
      pathogenesis is closely related to endogenous descending system of pain control. 
      However, the action mechanism underlying the effects of wrist–ankle acupuncture
      (WAA) versus electroacupuncture (EA) on CIBP remains unknown. Methods: Thirty-two
      Wistar rats were divided into sham, CIBP, EA-treated and WAA-treated groups. CIBP
      was induced in rats of the latter three groups. Time courses of weight and
      mechanical hyperalgesia threshold (MHT) were evaluated. After 6 days of EA or WAA
      treatment, the expressions of 5-hydroxytryotamine type 3A receptor (5-HT3AR) and 
      μ-opioid receptor (MOR) in rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and/or spinal cord,
      as well as the levels of 5-HT, β-endorphin, endomorphin-1 and endomorphin-2 in
      RVM and spinal cord, were detected. Results: Injection of cancer cells caused
      decreased MHT, which was attenuated by EA or WAA (P < 0.05). WAA had a quicker
      analgesic effect than EA (P < 0.05). No significant difference of MOR in RVM was 
      found among the four groups. EA or WAA counteracted the cancer-driven
      upregulation of 5-HT3AR and downregulation of MOR in spinal cord (P < 0.05), and 
      upregulation of 5-HT and downregulation of endomorphin-1 in both RVM and spinal
      cord (P < 0.05). β-endorphin and endomorphin-2 in RVM and spinal cord decreased
      in CIBP group compared with sham group (P < 0.05), but EA or WAA showed no
      significant effect on them, although a tendency of increasing effect was
      observed. Conclusion: WAA, similar to EA, alleviated mechanical hyperalgesia in
      CIBP rats by suppressing the expressions of 5-HT and 5-HT3AR, and increasing the 
      expressions of MOR and endomorphin-1 in RVM-spinal cord pathway of the descending
      pain-modulating system. However, WAA produced a quicker analgesic effect than EA,
      the mechanisms of which need further investigation.

TI  - High prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C viral
      infections among people who inject drugs: a potential stumbling block in the
      control of HIV and viral hepatitis in Tanzania.
LID - 177
AB  - Background: Tanzania has witnessed a significant decrease in the prevalence of
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and viral hepatitis in the general population 
      attributed to several interventional measures. It is uncertain whether this
      decline has also occurred among people who inject drugs (PWID). This study aimed 
      to determine the seroprevalence of HIV, Hepatitis B and C viruses infection among
      PWID recruited from their hotspot sites in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods: A
      cross-sectional study conducted between June and September 2017 recruited PWID
      from pre-identified hotspot sites using a snowball referral sampling technique. A
      structured questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding
      socio-demographic characteristics, behaviour and drug use. Blood was tested for
      the presence of IgG antibodies against HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and
      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Data were entered in the computer using
      excel software and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version
      20. Results: A total of 219 PWID were recruited, the majority of whom were males 
      (74.9%), unmarried (60.7%), had low education (62.6%) and low income (57.1%). The
      median age was 39 years, with an inter-quartile range of 35–43. Approximately
      32.0% had a history of drug injection for more than 3 years, 79.9% were injecting
      drugs more than 3 times per day and 47.5% were sharing needles. The overall
      prevalence of HIV, HBsAg, and HCV was 33.8, 7.8, and 50.2%, respectively. There
      was serologic evidence of at least one infection for 68.9%, while 22.4% had two
      or more infections. HIV infection was independently associated with being
      married, while HCV was associated with injecting drugs for more than 3 years and 
      unprotected sex. Conclusion: Over two-third of PWID had serologic evidence of
      infection with at least one virus while 22.4% having at least two infections. The
      high prevalence of HIV and viral hepatitis infections among PWID may hamper
      initiatives of ending HIV and viral hepatitis epidemics in Tanzania.

TI  - Excess abdominal fat is associated with cutaneous allodynia in individuals with
      migraine: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 9
AB  - Objective: To investigate the specific relationship between cutaneous allodynia
      (CA) and the percentages of body fat (BF) and abdominal fat in migraineurs.
      Additionally, we compared serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers in patients
      with and without CA. Background: Excess abdominal fat might facilitate
      progressive changes in nociceptive thresholds causing central sensitization,
      clinically reflected as CA, which could drive migraine progression. Methods: This
      prospective cohort study included 80 patients with migraine (mean age 39 years,
      81.2% female) and 39 non-migraine controls. We analysed each participant’s
      height, body weight, and body mass index (BMI). The amount and distribution of BF
      was also assessed by air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and ViScan,
      respectively. We analysed serum levels of markers of inflammation, during
      interictal periods. Results: We studied 52 patients with episodic migraine (EM)
      and 28 with chronic migraine (CM). Of the 80 patients, 53 (53.8%) had CA.
      Migraineurs with CA had a higher proportion of abdominal fat values than patients
      without CA (p = 0.04). The independent risk factors for CA were the use of
      migraine prophylaxis (OR 3.26, 95% CI [1.14 to 9.32]; p = 0.03), proportion of
      abdominal fat (OR 1.13, 95% CI [1.01 to 1.27]; p = 0.04), and presence of sleep
      disorders (OR 1.13, 95% CI [00.01 to 1.27]; p = 0.04). The concordance
      correlation coefficient between the ADP and BMI measurements was 0.51 (0.3681 to 
      0.6247). CA was not correlated with the mean plasma levels of inflammatory
      biomarkers. Conclusions: There is a relation between excess abdominal fat and CA.
      Abdominal obesity might contribute to the development of central sensitization in
      migraineurs, leading to migraine chronification.

TI  - Sugen–morphine model of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
LID - 2045894019898376
AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a fatal disease associated with pulmonary
      vascular remodeling and right ventricular hypertrophy. Pre-clinical animal models
      that reproduce the human pulmonary arterial hypertension process and
      pharmacological response to available therapies are critical for future drug
      development. The most prevalent animal model reproducing many aspects of
      angioobliterative forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension is the rat
      Sugen/hypoxia model in which Sugen, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      antagonist, primarily causes initiation of endothelial injury and later in the
      presence of hypoxia promotes proliferation of apoptosis-resistant endothelial
      cells. We previously demonstrated that exposure of human pulmonary microvascular 
      endothelium to morphine and HIV-proteins results in initial apoptosis followed by
      increased proliferation. Here, we demonstrate that the double-hit of morphine and
      Sugen 5416 (Sugen–morphine) in rats leads to the development of pulmonary
      arterial hypertension with significant medial hypertrophy of pre-acinar pulmonary
      arteries along with neo-intimal thickening of intra-acinar vessels. In addition, 
      the pulmonary smooth muscle and endothelial cells isolated from Sugen–morphine
      rats showed hyperproliferation and apoptotic resistance, respectively, in
      response to serum starvation. Our findings support that the dual hit model of
      Sugen 5416 and morphine provides another experimental strategy to induce
      significant pulmonary vascular remodeling and development of severe pulmonary
      arterial hypertension pathology in rats without exposure to hypoxia.

TI  - The Prevalence and Clinical Implications of Comorbid Back Pain in Shoulder
      Instability: A Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder
      Instability Cohort Study.
LID - 2325967119894738
AB  - Background:: Understanding predictors of pain is critical, as recent literature
      shows that comorbid back pain is an independent risk factor for worse functional 
      and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as well as increased opioid dependence after
      total joint arthroplasty. Purpose/Hypothesis:: The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate whether comorbid back pain would be predictive of pain or self-reported 
      instability symptoms at the time of stabilization surgery. We hypothesized that
      comorbid back pain will correlate with increased pain at the time of surgery as
      well as with worse scores on shoulder-related PRO measures. Study Design::
      Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods:: As part of the Multicenter
      Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder Instability cohort, patients
      consented to participate in pre- and intraoperative data collection. Demographic 
      characteristics, injury history, preoperative PRO scores, and radiologic and
      intraoperative findings were recorded for patients undergoing surgical shoulder
      stabilization. Patients were also asked, whether they had any back pain.
      Results:: The study cohort consisted of 1001 patients (81% male; mean age, 24.1
      years). Patients with comorbid back pain (158 patients; 15.8%) were significantly
      older (28.1 vs 23.4 years; P < .001) and were more likely to be female (25.3% vs 
      17.4%; P = .02) but did not differ in terms of either preoperative imaging or
      intraoperative findings. Patients with self-reported back pain had significantly 
      worse preoperative pain and shoulder-related PRO scores (American Shoulder and
      Elbow Surgeons score, Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index) (P < .001),
      more frequent depression (22.2% vs 8.3%; P < .001), poorer mental health status
      (worse scores for the RAND 36-Item Health Survey Mental Component Score, Iowa
      Quick Screen, and Personality Assessment Screener) (P < .01), and worse
      preoperative expectations (P < .01). Conclusion:: Despite having similar physical
      findings, patients with comorbid back pain had more severe preoperative pain and 
      self-reported symptoms of instability as well as more frequent depression and
      lower mental health scores. The combination of disproportionate shoulder pain,
      comorbid back pain and mental health conditions, and inferior preoperative
      expectations may affect not only the patient’s preoperative state but also
      postoperative pain control and/or postoperative outcomes.

TI  - Reciprocal association between depression and peptic ulcers: Two longitudinal
      follow-up studies using a national sample cohort.
LID - 1749
AB  - This study was aimed to explore the bidirectional association between depression 
      and peptic ulcers. The ≥20-year-old participants of the Korean National Health
      Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort from 2002 to 2013 were included in the
      study. In study I, 30,306 depression patients were 1:4 matched with 121,224
      control I participants. In study II, 127,590 peptic ulcer patients were 1:1
      matched with 127,590 control II participants. The stratified Cox-proportional
      hazards models were used to analyse the hazard ratio (HR) of depression for
      peptic ulcers (study I) and of peptic ulcers for depression (study II). A total
      of 8.9% (2,703/ 30,306) of depression patients and 7.3% (8,896/ 121,224) of
      patients in the control I group had peptic ulcers (P < 0.001). The depression
      group had an adjusted HR for peptic ulcers that was 1.14-fold higher than that of
      the control I group (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.09–1.19, P < 0.001). A 
      total of 6.4% (8,144/ 127,590) of peptic ulcer patients and 3.5% (4,515/127,590) 
      of patients in the control II group had depression (P < 0.001). The peptic ulcer 
      group had an adjusted HR for depression that was 1.68-fold higher than that of
      the control II group (95% CI = 1.62–1.74, P < 0.001). Depression and peptic
      ulcers exhibited a bidirectional relationship.

TI  - A kinetic method for measuring agonist efficacy and ligand bias using high
      resolution biosensors and a kinetic data analysis framework.
LID - 1766
AB  - The kinetics/dynamics of signaling are of increasing value for G-protein-coupled 
      receptor therapeutic development, including spatiotemporal signaling and the
      kinetic context of biased agonism. Effective application of signaling kinetics to
      developing new therapeutics requires reliable kinetic assays and an analysis
      framework to extract kinetic pharmacological parameters. Here we describe a
      platform for measuring arrestin recruitment kinetics to GPCRs using a high
      quantum yield, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, and a data analysis
      framework to quantify the recruitment kinetics. The sensor enabled high temporal 
      resolution measurement of arrestin recruitment to the angiotensin AT1 and
      vasopressin V2 receptors. The analysis quantified the initial rate of arrestin
      recruitment (kτ), a biologically-meaningful kinetic drug efficacy parameter, by
      fitting time course data using routine curve-fitting methods. Biased agonism was 
      assessed by comparing kτ values for arrestin recruitment with those for Gq
      signaling via the AT1 receptor. The kτ ratio values were in good agreement with
      bias estimates from existing methods. This platform potentially improves and
      simplifies assessment of biased agonism because the same assay modality is used
      to compare pathways (potentially in the same cells), the analysis method is
      parsimonious and intuitive, and kinetic context is factored into the bias
      measurement.

TI  - Some t-tests for N-of-1 trials with serial correlation.
LID - e0228077
AB  - N-of-1 trials allow inference between two treatments given to a single
      individual. Most often, clinical investigators analyze an individual’s N-of-1
      trial data with usual t-tests or simple nonparametric methods. These simple
      methods do not account for serial correlation in repeated observations coming
      from the individual. Existing methods accounting for serial correlation require
      simulation, multiple N-of-1 trials, or both. Here, we develop t-tests that
      account for serial correlation in a single individual. The development includes
      effect size and precision calculations, both of which are useful for study
      planning. We then use Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate statistical properties
      of these serial t-tests, namely, Type I and II errors, and confidence interval
      widths, and compare these statistical properties to those of analogous usual
      t-test. The serial t-tests clearly outperform the usual t-tests commonly used in 
      reporting N-of-1 results. Examples from N-of-1 clinical trials in fibromyalgia
      patients and from a behavioral health setting exhibit how accounting for serial
      correlation can change inferences. These t-tests are easily implemented and more 
      appropriate than simple methods commonly used; however, caution is needed when
      analyzing only a few observations.

TI  - Intravenous versus subcutaneous route pharmacokinetics of paracetamol
      (acetaminophen) in palliative care patients: study protocol for a randomized
      trial (ParaSCIVPallia).
LID - 138
AB  - Background: Among palliative care (PC) patients who are administered paracetamol,
      the subcutaneous (SC) route is often an alternative to the intravenous (IV)
      route. Yet pharmacological and clinical data on whether these are equivalent
      pharmacokinetically are lacking. Many French palliative teams are now empirically
      using paracetamol by the SC route, but there are no data to support this
      practice. This trial aims to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of
      paracetomol between the IV and SC routes in PC patients. Methods/design: This is 
      a randomized, open, crossover study in two PC centers. The primary endpoints are 
      AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, Vd, and t1/2. All adverse events will be reported for a
      safety analysis. Twenty adult PC patients with an IV device having spontaneous
      pain not related to care, with a numeric pain rate scale > 3/10, or having a
      systematic prescription of paracetamol as the usual treatment will be included.
      All patients also have to meet all eligibility criteria. Conclusion: This is the 
      first study comparing PK parameters for IV paracetamol versus SC paracetamol in
      PC patients. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03944044. Registered on 4

TI  - Effect of Botulinum Toxin A on Bladder Pain—Molecular Evidence and Animal
      Studies.
LID - 98
AB  - Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) is a powerful neurotoxin with long-lasting activity
      that blocks muscle contractions. In addition to effects on neuromuscular
      junctions, BTX-A also plays a role in sensory feedback loops, suggesting the
      potentiality for pain relief. Although the only approved indications for BTX-A in
      the bladder are neurogenic detrusor overactivity and refractory overactive
      bladder, BTX-A injections to treat bladder pain refractory to conventional
      therapies are also recommended. The mechanism of BTX-A activity in bladder pain
      is complex, with several hypotheses proposed in recent studies. Here we
      comprehensively reviewed properties of BTX-A in peripheral afferent and efferent 
      nerves, the inhibition of nociceptive neurotransmitter release, the reduction of 
      stretch-related visceral pain, and its anti-inflammatory effects on the bladder
      urothelium. Studies have also revealed possible effects of BTX-A in the human
      brain. However, further basic and clinical studies are warranted to provide solid
      evidence-based support in using BTX-A to treat bladder pain.

TI  - Mobile Peer-Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine
      Learning Tool.
LID - e200001
AB  - Background:: The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not
      receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access 
      to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs
      turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related 
      information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and
      during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery
      programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as
      reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and 
      scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content
      moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or “trolling”); and lack
      common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care. Methods:: This 
      present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile 
      treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure,
      technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. Forty adults
      receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked to pilot a
      smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the “Marigold App”, for a
      duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study to
      obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative
      interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform.
      Anticipated findings and future directions:: The Marigold mobile platform will
      allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to
      different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and
      constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the
      emotional sentiment in messages, automatically “flagging” critical or clinically 
      relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools 
      by adapting them to catch OUD-specific “flags” in peer messages while also
      examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.

TI  - Factors associated with the successful completion of a substance rehabilitation
      programme at a psychiatric training hospital.
LID - 1255
AB  - Background: Comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders are common and
      present several treatment challenges. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine
      which patient and substance factors are associated with the completion of a
      substance rehabilitation programme in psychiatric inpatients. Setting: The study 
      was conducted at the Substance Rehabilitation Unit (SRU) at Weskoppies Hospital, 
      a psychiatric training hospital in South Africa, which offers a 6-week programme 
      at the hospital for psychiatric inpatients. Methods: This descriptive,
      retrospective hospital-based study was carried out comparing completers and
      non-completers of the SRU programme with respect to patient and substance
      factors. All patients accepted into the SRU during 2013–2014 were included (n =
      119). Data were collected over a year (2016–2017) from the clinical files, SRU
      referral forms, SRU attendance register, hospital computerised demographic
      records, nursing notes and administration files using a data collection sheet
      designed by the researchers for this study. Comparison between completers and
      non-completers was performed using Chi-Square or Fisher’s Exact tests. Results:
      The SRU accepted 119 patients from January 2013 to December 2014. The majority of
      the sample were involuntary patients (n = 39), 30–49 years old (n = 57), male (n 
      = 89), unmarried (n = 112), never having received a disability grant (n = 27),
      unemployed (n = 96) and with a Grade 8–11 education (n = 49). Substance-induced
      psychotic disorders (n = 39), schizophrenia (n = 29) and bipolar disorders (n =
      22) were found to be common. Frequent medical comorbidities included head injury 
      (n = 27), cardiovascular disease (n = 18) and HIV reactivity (n = 7). Cannabis (n
      = 98), alcohol (n = 94) and nicotine (n = 90) were the most frequently used
      substances. Level of education (p = 0.004), disability grant status (p = 0.004), 
      Nyaope use (p = 0.001) and nicotine use (p = 0.049) were statistically seen to be
      significantly associated with completion. Psychiatric diagnoses and general
      medical comorbidity were not associated with completion. Conclusions: This study 
      has yielded several results in areas that have not yet been well researched in
      South Africa. Risk factors for non-completion may include lower levels of
      education, being on a disability grant and using Nyaope or nicotine, but may vary
      in different settings. Future research should focus on identifying further
      factors that may affect completion of substance rehabilitation in psychiatric
      inpatients, the role of disability grants in patients with co-occurring disorders
      and the effect of Nyaope and nicotine use on treatment outcomes in this
      population. Effective and accessible interventions to assist vulnerable patients 
      also need to be identified.

TI  - Battlefield Acupuncture for Chronic Pain Management in Patients on Long-Term
      Opioid Therapy.
PG  - 38-44
AB  - Objectives: Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) is a unique auricular acupuncture
      procedure utilized by many Veterans Affairs Healthcare Administration facilities.
      Several previous studies have shown an immediate reduction in pain for up to 2
      weeks post BFA. The long-term effects of BFA and its potential to decrease opioid
      use had yet to be analyzed. This study was conducted to analyze the effectiveness
      of BFA to decrease chronic pain immediately and 6 months after treatment and to
      decrease the number of opioids needed for management of chronic pain.Materials
      and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study comparing veterans who
      received BFA and were prescribed opioids for their chronic pain to veterans who
      did not receive BFA. The treatment group included 24 veterans who received BFA
      and had opioid contracts. The comparison group consisted of 23 randomly selected 
      veterans who had opioid contracts but did not receive BFA. A numeric rating scale
      (NRS) was used to measure pain before and after treatment, as well as 3 months
      prior and 6 months post. The average morphine mg equivalents for opioids 3 months
      prior and 6 months post treatment were also compared. Differences between groups 
      were statistically analyzed by an analysis of variance and a Student's
      t-test.Results: Significant average decreases of 1.3 points on the NRS occurred
      in 66.1% immediately after the procedure. No significant decreases in pain were
      found. No significant changes of the average number of opioids over the 9 months 
      analyzed were found.Conclusions: BFA is effective for immediate pain reduction.
      Further research with a randomized controlled trial in a larger population is
      needed to assess BFA effects on chronic pain and opioid dependency.

TI  - National Medicines Policy 2.0: a vision for the future.
PG  - 24-6
AB  - Australia’s National Medicines Policy was launched 20 years ago with the aim of
      improving health outcomes for all Australians. It was developed in partnership
      with healthcare professionals, consumers and the pharmaceutical industry: The key
      parts of the Policy focus on timely access to high-quality and affordable
      medicines and their safe and judicious use. It also supports a viable and
      responsible pharmaceutical industry: Since the Policy was first launched,
      Australia has seen significant changes in healthcare systems, medicines
      subsidies, health services remuneration, digital technologies and the

AB  - Despite the still prevailing notion of a shared substrate of action for all
      addictive drugs, there is evidence suggesting that opioid and psychostimulant
      drugs differ substantially in terms of their neurobiological and behavioral
      effects. These differences may reflect separate neural circuits engaged by the
      two drugs.

TI  - Incidence of and risk factors for postoperative delirium in older adult patients 
      undergoing noncardiac surgery: a prospective study.
LID - 40
AB  - Background: To identify the incidence of, risk factors for, and outcomes
      associated with postoperative delirium (POD) in older adult patients who
      underwent noncardiac surgery. Methods: This prospective study recruited patients 
      aged ≥ 60 years who were scheduled to undergo noncardiac surgery at Siriraj
      Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand). Functional and cognitive statuses were assessed
      preoperatively using Barthel Index (BI) and the modified Informant Questionnaire 
      on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, respectively. POD was diagnosed based on the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition criteria.
      Incidence of POD was reported. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to 
      identify risk factors for POD. Results: Of the 249 included patients, 29 (11.6%) 
      developed POD. Most patients (61.3%) developed delirium on postoperative day 1.
      Univariate analysis showed age ≥ 75 years, BI score ≤ 70, pre-existing dementia, 
      preoperative use of opioid or benzodiazepine, preoperative infection, and
      hematocrit < 30% to be significantly associated with POD. Multivariate logistic
      analysis revealed pre-existing dementia (adjusted risk ratio [RR]: 3.95, 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.91–8.17; p < 0.001) and age ≥ 75 years (adjusted RR: 
      2.54, 95% CI: 1.11–5.80; p = 0.027) to be independent risk factors for POD.
      Median length of hospital stay was 10 (range: 3–36) days for patients with POD
      versus 6 (range: 2–76) days for those without delirium (p < 0.001). Conclusions: 
      POD remains a common surgical complication, with an incidence of 11.6%. Patients 
      with pre-existing dementia and age ≥ 75 years are the most vulnerable high-risk
      group. A multidisciplinary team consisting of anesthesiologists and geriatricians
      should implement perioperative care to prevent and manage POD.

TI  - Effect of sex differences in remifentanil requirements for inhibiting the
      response to a CO2 pneumoperitoneum during propofol anesthesia: an up-and-down
      sequential allocation trial.
LID - 35
AB  - Background: A CO2 pneumoperitoneum during a laparoscopic procedure causes violent
      hemodynamic changes. However, the remifentanil required to inhibit the
      cardiovascular response to a CO2 pneumoperitoneum combined with propofol remains 
      unknown. Moreover, the sex of the patient may influence the response to opioids, 
      which can affect this requirement. The main objective of this study was to
      compare the required median effective concentration (EC50) of remifentanil for
      inhibiting the cardiovascular response to a CO2 pneumoperitoneum between female
      and male patients during propofol anesthesia. Methods: The current study is an
      up-and-down sequential allocation trial. Forty-six patients with American Society
      of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, a body mass index 18 to 30 kg/m2,
      aged 20 to 60 years, and scheduled for laparoscopic surgery were enrolled.
      Induction of anesthesia was performed by target-controlled infusion. The
      effective effect-site concentration (Ce) of propofol was 4 μg/ml. The Ce of
      remifentanil was initially 4 ng/ml and then adjusted to a predetermined level
      after I-gel laryngeal mask airway insertion. The Ce of remifentanil for each
      patient was determined by the response of the previous patient using the modified
      Dixon “up-and-down” method. The first patient received remifentanil at 5.0 ng/ml 
      Ce, and the step size between patients was 0.5 ng/ml. Results: Patients
      characteristics including age, body mass index, American Society of
      Anesthesiologists physical status, type of surgery and surgery duration, were
      comparable between male and female patients. The EC50 of remifentanil required to
      inhibit the response to a CO2 pneumoperitoneum based on the Dixon “up-and-down”
      method in women (4.17 ± 0.38 ng/ml) was significantly lower than that in men
      (5.00 ± 0.52 ng/ml) during propofol anesthesia (P = 0.01). Conclusions: The EC50 
      of remifentanil required to inhibit the response to a CO2 pneumoperitoneum was
      lower in women than in men during propofol anesthesia. Trial registration: The
      study was registered at http://www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR-IOR-17011906, 8th, July,
      2017).

TI  - Analgosedation for diagnostic and interventional procedures: a countrywide survey
      of pediatric centers in Germany.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: As more and more diagnostic and interventional options are becoming
      available for use in pediatric patients, techniques of procedural sedation
      analgesia (PSA) are being administered in considerably growing numbers as well.
      Aims: The objective of this research effort was to conduct the first countrywide 
      survey on the status quo of sedation analgesia as delivered to children and
      adolescents in Germany. Methods: We dispatched letters to all pediatric hospital 
      settings in Germany (n = 305), including a questionnaire that had been developed 
      with existing guidelines taken into account. Its items were designed to elucidate
      the current practice of PSA throughout these pediatric centers regarding (a)
      organizational structures and (b) standards of medication and staffing. Results: 
      A total of 138 centers returned the questionnaire, hence the response rate was
      45.2%. Numerous centers had implemented adequate structures and staffing
      standards. Deficits were nevertheless identified, most notably in terms of
      on-location equipment and staff provided to deliver sedations. Essential items of
      equipment were not provided in up to 26.8% of centers. Adequate staffing was not 
      provided in up to 44.2% of centers, depending on the diagnostic or interventional
      procedures for which the PSA was delivered. The most widely used sedative agents 
      were midazolam, ketamine/esketamine, and propofol. Conclusions: Adequate care
      structures for the management of procedural sedation analgesia have been
      implemented by many pediatric centers in Germany. On the downside, these findings
      also reveal deficits that will take efforts to be eliminated.

TI  - Using routine referral data for patients with knee and hip pain to improve access
      to specialist care.
LID - 66
AB  - Background: Referral letters from primary care contain a large amount of
      information that could be used to improve the appropriateness of the referral
      pathway for individuals seeking specialist opinion for knee or hip pain. The
      primary aim of this study was to evaluate the content of the referral letters to 
      identify information that can independently predict an optimal care pathway.
      Methods: Using a prospective longitudinal design, a convenience sample of
      patients with hip or knee pain were recruited from orthopaedic, specialist
      general practice and advanced physiotherapy practitioner clinics. Individuals
      completed a Knee or hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Score at initial consultation and 
      after 6 months. Participant demographics, body mass index, medication and
      co-morbidity data were extracted from the referral letters. Free text of the
      referral letters was mapped automatically onto the Unified Medical Language
      System to identify relevant clinical variables. Treatment outcomes were extracted
      from the consultation letters. Each outcome was classified as being an optimal or
      sub-optimal pathway, where an optimal pathway was defined as the one that results
      in the right treatment at the right time. Logistic regression was used to
      identify variables that were independently associated with an optimal pathway.
      Results: A total of 643 participants were recruited, 419 (66.7%) were classified 
      as having an optimal pathway. Variables independently associated with having an
      optimal care pathway were lower body mass index (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.0
      p = 0.004), named disease or syndromes (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8, p = 0.02) and 
      taking pharmacologic substances (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.3, p = 0.02). Having a
      single diagnostic procedure was associated with a suboptimal pathway (OR 0.5, 95%
      CI 0.3 to 0.9 p < 0.001). Neither Knee nor Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome scores were
      associated with an optimal pathway. Body mass index was found to be a good
      predictor of patient rated function (coefficient − 0.8, 95% CI -1.1, − 0.4
      p < 0.001). Conclusion: Over 30% of patients followed sub-optimal care pathway,
      which represents potential inefficiency and wasted healthcare resource. A core
      data set including body mass index should be considered as this was a predictor
      of optimal care and patient rated pain and function.

      neuropathy.
LID - 1744806920904292
AB  - N-Acetylcysteine, one of the most prescribed antioxidant drugs, enhances pain
      threshold in rodents and humans by activating mGlu2 metabotropic glutamate
      receptors. Here, we assessed the analgesic activity of N-acetylcysteine in the
      streptozotocin model of painful diabetic neuropathy and examined the effect of
      N-acetylcysteine on proteins that are involved in mechanisms of nociceptive
      sensitization. Mice with blood glucose levels ≥250 mg/dl in response to a single 
      intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg) were used for the 
      assessment of mechanical pain thresholds. Systemic treatment with
      N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg, i.p., either single injection or daily injections
      for seven days) caused analgesia in diabetic mice. N-acetylcysteine-induced
      analgesia was abrogated by the Sxc− inhibitors, sulfasalazine (8 mg/kg, i.p.),
      erastin (30 mg/kg, i.p.), and sorafenib (10 mg/kg, i.p.), or by the mGlu2/3
      receptor antagonist, LY341495 (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Repeated administrations of
      N-acetylcysteine in diabetic mice reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the dorsal
      region of the lumbar spinal cord. The analgesic activity of N-acetylcysteine was 
      occluded by the MEK inhibitor, PD0325901 (25 mg/kg, i.p.), the TRPV1 channel
      blocker, capsazepine (40 mg/kg, i.p.), or by a cocktail of NMDA and mGlu5
      metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (memantine, 25 mg/kg, plus MTEP,
      5 mg/kg, both i.p.). These findings offer the first demonstration that
      N-acetylcysteine relieves pain associated with diabetic neuropathy and holds
      promise for the use of N-acetylcysteine as an add-on drug in diabetic patients.

      pathology. We evaluated the usefulness of single-photon emission computed
      tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in diagnosing CEH and its
      interventional treatment. Retrospectively, 23 patients diagnosed with CEH between
      March 2016 to August 2018 were allocated to SPECT/CT (n = 11) and control (n =
      12) groups. The SPECT/CT group was further stratified into SPECT/CT(+) and
      SPECT/CT(-) groups according to the presence of positive findings. Patients in
      the SPECT/CT group underwent an intra-articular injection at a radiologically
      verified lesion site, whereas those in the control group underwent third
      occipital nerve block. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with the visual analog
      scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), and global perceived effect (GPE) scale
      at baseline, and at one, three, and six months postoperatively. The SPECT/CT
      group showed less VAS, NDI, and GPE scores at six months postoperatively (2.91 ± 
      2.30 vs. 4.42 ± 1.62, p = 0.08; 38.00 ± 16.54 vs. 48.7 ± 12.40, p = 0.093; 2.00 ±
      1.41 vs. 3.17 ± 1.11, p = 0.039). Successful responders at six months
      postoperatively were higher in the SPECT/CT(+) group than in the control group
      (75% vs. 0%). SPECT/CT can identify arthritic changes and accurately define
      therapeutic targets.

TI  - Opioid versus opioid-free analgesia after surgical discharge: protocol for a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - e035443
AB  - Introduction: Excessive prescribing after surgery has contributed to a public
      health crisis of opioid addiction and overdose in North America. However, the
      value of prescribing opioids to manage postoperative pain after surgical
      discharge remains unclear. We propose a systematic review and meta-analysis to
      assess the extent to which opioid analgesia impact postoperative pain intensity
      and adverse events in comparison to opioid-free analgesia in patients discharged 
      after surgery. Methods and analysis: Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase,
      Cochrane Library, Scopus, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL and PsycINFO) will be searched for
      multi-dose randomised-trials examining the comparative effectiveness of opioid
      versus opioid-free analgesia after surgical discharge. Studies published from
      January 1990 to July 2019 will be targeted, with no language restrictions. The
      search will be re-run before manuscript submission to include most recent
      literature. We will consider studies involving patients undergoing minor and
      major surgery. Teams of reviewers will, independently and in duplicate, assess
      eligibility, extract data and evaluate risk of bias. Our main outcomes of
      interest are pain intensity and postoperative vomiting. Study results will be
      pooled using random effects models. When trials report outcomes for a common
      domain (eg, pain intensity) using different scales, we will convert effect sizes 
      to a common standard metric (eg, Visual Analogue Scale). Minimally important
      clinical differences reported in previous literature will be considered when
      interpreting results. Subgroup analyses defined a priori will be conducted to
      explore heterogeneity. Risk of bias will be assessed according to the Cochrane
      Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. The quality of evidence for all outcomes
      will be evaluated using the GRADE rating system. Ethics and dissemination:
      Ethical approval is not required since this is a systematic review of published
      studies. Our results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented
      at relevant conferences. Further knowledge dissemination will be sought via
      public and patient organisations focussed on pain and opioid-related harms.

TI  - Comprehensive Care for Patients with Sarcoidosis.
LID - 390
AB  - Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease, associated with significant
      morbidity and impaired quality of life. Treatment is aimed at recovering organ
      function, reducing symptom burden and improving quality of life. Because of the
      heterogeneity and variable disease course, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary
      approach to care is needed. Comprehensive care includes not only pharmacological 
      interventions, but also supportive measures aimed at relieving symptoms and
      improving quality of life. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most
      recent knowledge regarding different aspects of care and propose a structured
      approach to sarcoidosis management.

TI  - Nitrous oxide recreational abuse presenting with myeloneuropathy and mimicking
      Guillain-Barre syndrome .
PG  - 54-7
AB  - The recreational use of nitrous oxide (N2O) is increasing in festivals,
      university parties, clubs, private residences, and parks. The abuse of N2O has
      serious complications of the central and peripheral nervous system. In this
      article, we report a case of a 28-year-old previously healthy man who presented
      with a three-day history of rapidly progressive leg numbness, tingling, and
      weakness with gait instability and frequent falls. He had a history of marijuana 
      use and daily inhalation of N2O (approximately 20 whippets daily over 2-3 years).
      He was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome and was
      started on intravenous immunoglobulin. Three days after admission, paresthesia
      ascended to the level of nipple line, and his weakness in the lower limb
      increased significantly. MRI of the cervical spine showed focal non-enhancing
      lesions extending from C4 to C6. Serum analysis showed low vitamin B12 level,
      elevated methylmalonic acid, and elevated homocysteine level. Supplemental 1000
      μg/day of vitamin B12 intramuscular injections and 15 mg of folic acid tablets
      were given. The patient showed gradual improvement. This is a rare case of N2O
      recreational abuse presenting with myeloneuropathy and mimicking Guillain- Barre 
      syndrome. This case highlights the importance of detailed history and physical
      examination in patients who arrive at the hospital with clinical features of
      Guillain-Barre syndrome. This is especially true if there are red flags such as
      drug abuse or discrepancy between clinical and para-clinical (investigations)
      parameters. Neuroimaging of the brain and spinal cord might be necessary to score
      the final diagnosis in such cases.

TI  - Lumbar Erector Spinae Plane Block as a Main Anesthetic Method for Hip Surgery in 
      High Risk Elderly Patients: Initial Experience with a Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - Objective: Since initial description by Forero for thoracic region, ultrasound
      guided erector spinae plane (ESP) block has experienced several surgeries for
      postoperative pain management, chronic pain or surgical anesthesia. Although ESP 
      block has been reported to provide effective analgesia in the thoracic region,
      its effect in lumbar region still unclear. In this study we aimed to showed our
      successful experience with lumbar ESP block as a main anesthetic technique in
      fifteen high risk elderly patients undergoing hip surgery with mild propofol
      sedation. Materials and Methods: In this observational study high risk elderly
      fifteen patients received lumbar ESP block as a main anesthetic technique with
      mild propofol sedation. 40 mL of local anesthetic mixture (20 mL bupivacaine
      0.5%, 10 mL lidocaine 2%, and 10 mL normal saline) was administered between the
      erector spinae muscles and transverse process at the level of the 4th lumbar
      vertebra. Also we demonstrate magnetic resonance images and discuss the anatomic 
      basis of lumbar ESP block. Results: All patients’ surgeries were completed
      without requirement for general anesthesia or local anesthesia infiltration of
      the surgical site. All patients’ pain scores were <2/10 in the recovery room.
      Significant contrast spread was observed between the Th12 and L5 transverse
      process and erector spinae muscle and between multifidus muscle and iliocostal
      muscle at the L2–4 levels. Contrast material was observed at the anterior of the 
      transverse process spreading to the paravertebral, foraminal and partially
      epidural area/spaces and also in the areas where the lumbar nerves enter the
      psoas muscle. Conclusion: Lumbar ESP block when combined with mild sedoanalgesia 
      provides adequate and safe anesthesia in high risk elderly patients undergoing
      hip surgery.

TI  - Is a Combination of the Serratus Intercostal Plane Block and Rectus Sheath Block 
      Superior to the Bilateral Oblique Subcostal Transversus Abdominis Plane Block in 
      Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy?
PG  - 34-7
AB  - Objective: The serratus intercostal plane block (SIPB) is a recently defined
      interfascial plane block. The oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane block
      (OSTAP) is another type of interfascial plane block, and it is also used as a
      part of multimodal analgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
      (LC). In this retrospective study, we evaluated the effects of the bilateral
      OSTAP and a combination of the right SIPB and bilateral rectus sheath block (RSB)
      on the postoperative pain and analgesia requirement in patients undergoing LC.
      Materials and Methods: Data of the patients who underwent LC between May 2018 and
      November 2018 were evaluated retrospectively. Postoperative pain was evaluated
      using the numeric rating scale (NRS), and 24-hour tramadol consumption and rescue
      analgesia requirements were compared. Results: Bilateral OSTAP was applied to 47 
      patients, and SIPB+RSB was applied to 25 patients. Postoperative pain scores were
      similar between the two groups. In the first 24 hours, tramadol requirement in
      the SIPB+RSB group was significantly lower than in the OSTAP block group
      (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the NRS
      averages at different time frames between the two block groups. Conclusion: We
      found that when SIPB is used as a part of multimodal analgesia in a combination
      with RSB in LS, it improves the quality of analgesia and decreases the analgesic 
      requirement compared to patients undergoing a bilateral OSTAP block. Randomized
      controlled trials are necessary to compare the effects of SIPB alone and in a
      combination with other blocks in LC.

LID - 1534735419893766
AB  - Purpose: To assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effectiveness of a
      12-week multimodal Qigong Mind-Body Exercise (QMBE) program for breast cancer
      survivors with persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP). Methods: This was a
      single-arm mixed-methods pilot study. Primary outcome measures were feasibility
      (recruitment, adherence) and safety. Validated self-report questionnaires were
      used to evaluate a constellation of interdependent symptoms, including pain,
      fatigue, mood, exercise, interoceptive awareness, and health-related quality of
      life at baseline and 12 weeks. A subset of the instruments was administered 6
      months postintervention. Shoulder range of motion and grip strength were
      objectively assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. Qualitative interviews were
      conducted at baseline and 12 weeks. Results: Twenty-one participants were
      enrolled; 18 and 17 participants, respectively, completed the 12-week and 6-month
      outcome assessment. No serious adverse events were reported. Statistically
      significant improvements were observed at 12 weeks in pain severity and
      interference, fatigue, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, self-esteem, pain
      catastrophizing, and several subdomains of quality of life, interoceptive
      awareness, and shoulder range of motion. Changes in pain, fatigue, pain
      catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, and quality of life were clinically
      meaningful. Postintervention effects were sustained at 6 months. Conclusions:
      QMBE is a safe and gentle multimodal intervention that shows promise in
      conferring a broad range of psychosocial and physical benefits for breast cancer 
      survivors with PPSP. Results support the value of future studies evaluating the
      impact of QMBE on multiple outcomes relevant to breast cancer survivors with
      PPSP.

TI  - Fentanyl inhibits the progression of gastric cancer through the suppression of
      MMP-9 via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
LID - 118
AB  - Background: Fentanyl is a drug commonly used for perioperative and postoperative 
      analgesia. Previous studies have confirmed that fentanyl can affect the
      progression of gastric cancer; however, this effect has not yet been elucidated. 
      The purpose of our study was thus to investigate the role of fentanyl in gastric 
      cancer and clarify its potential mechanisms. Methods: A CCK-8 assay was used to
      determine the proliferation of MGC-803 cells, while Transwell assay and wound
      healing assay were used to determine the invasion and migration abilities,
      respectively. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were assessed by flow cytometry, and
      the ultrastructure of the cells was examined with a transmission electron
      microscope. The mRNA expression levels of serine-threonine protein kinase 1
      (Akt-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and death-associated protein kinase 
      1 (DAPK1) were evaluated by real-time (RT) quantitative PCR. The protein
      expression of p-Akt, MMP-9, and caspase-9 was detected by western blot analysis. 
      To study the interaction of fentanyl with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
      (PI3K)/Akt/MMP-9 pathway, PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and MMP-9 inhibitor (SB-3CT) 
      were used to treat the MGC-803 cells. Results: Findings indicated that fentanyl
      inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and migration of MGC-803 cells.
      Specifically, fentanyl inhibits the expression of MMP-9 and enhances the
      expression of apoptosis-promoting factors such as caspase-9 and DAPK1 through the
      PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Cell cycle arrest was observed in the G0/G1 phase.
      Furthermore, the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/MMP-9 by LY294002 and SB-3CT enhanced the
      anticancer effects of fentanyl. Conclusions: Fentanyl inhibits the proliferation,
      invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/MMP-9
      pathway, which could be very useful for gastric cancer treatment.

TI  - Robotic adrenalectomy: when and how?
PG  - S166-72
AB  - Currently, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is considered as the preferred technique to
      manage adrenal tumors. However, there are no prospective randomized studies
      evaluating this strategy. With the recent advances in surgical equipment and the 
      widespread of robotic technology, a robotic approach is considered as an
      interesting option in some medical centers. This approach seems to be feasible
      and safe but high-level evidence of its benefits is still lacking. This review
      summarizes indications, advantages and drawbacks of robotic adrenalectomy and
      describes its surgical technique.

TI  - Association Between Formulary Coverage and Use of Abuse-Deterrent Prescription
      Opioids, Risk for Abuse or Overdose, and Associated Healthcare Resource
      Utilization.
PG  - 21-31
AB  - Background: Significant public health concerns exist regarding the misuse and
      abuse of prescription opioids. Abuse-deterrent formulation (ADF) opioids may be
      leveraged as an important tool for combating the current opioid crisis.
      Objectives: To evaluate the relationships between ADF opioid formulary coverage
      and the ADF utilization rate, the risk for opioid abuse or overdose, opioid abuse
      or overdose–related healthcare resource utilization, and medical costs within a
      calendar year. Methods: This cross-sectional multiyear panel study included
      adults prescribed an opioid medication in 2015 or 2016. We analyzed the medical
      and pharmacy claims linked to health plan benefit design data. An ADF
      opioid—including reformulated oxycodone hydrochloride (HCl) controlled-release
      (CR; reformulated OxyContin), morphine sulfate and naltrexone HCl
      extended-release (ER; Embeda), and hydrocodone bitartrate ER (Hysingla ER)—was
      considered covered if it was listed on the health plan's formulary. Generalized
      linear models were used to assess the association between ADF opioid formulary
      coverage and the study outcomes. Results: Of 1,350,607 eligible patients, those
      enrolled in health plans with coverage of ADF opioids were more likely to fill a 
      prescription for an ADF opioid than those enrolled in plans that did not cover
      ADF opioids. The risk for opioid abuse or overdose was significantly lower among 
      patients enrolled in plans with broader ADF coverage (adjusted odds ratio [OR],
      0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86–0.95 for oxycodone HCl CR only vs no ADF
      coverage; adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.67–0.73 for oxycodone HCl CR plus ≥1 ADF
      opiods vs no ADF; adjusted OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73–0.81 for oxycodone HCl CR plus 
      ≥1 ADF opiods vs oxycodone HCl CR only; all P <.0001). Approximately 15% and 25% 
      reductions in the opioid abuse or overdose–related hospitalization rate and
      medical costs were observed for those in the oxycodone HCl CR plus ≥1 ADF opioids
      coverage group versus those without ADF opioid coverage. Conclusions: Broad
      formulary coverage of ADF opioids is associated with reduced rates of opioid
      abuse or overdose in real-world managed care populations. Health plan
      administrators and policymakers may consider improving the formulary coverage of 
      ADF opioids as a strategy to ensure appropriate patient access to necessary pain 
      medications while mitigating risk for opioid abuse or overdose.

TI  - Recreational Cannabis Legalization in the US and Maternal Use during the
      Preconception, Prenatal, and Postpartum Periods.
LID - 909
AB  - In the United States (US), recreational cannabis use is on the rise. Since 2011, 
      11 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for adult
      recreational use. As additional states consider legalizing, there is an urgent
      need to assess associations between recreational cannabis legalization and
      maternal use in the preconception, prenatal, and postpartum periods—all critical 
      windows for maternal and child health. Using cross-sectional data from the 2016
      Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, we assessed associations between
      state cannabis legalization and self-reported maternal cannabis use. Using
      logistic regression, we estimated the adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) of cannabis 
      use during the preconception, prenatal, and postpartum period for women
      delivering a live-born infant in three states that had legalized recreational
      cannabis (Alaska, Colorado, and Washington) and three states that had not
      legalized (Maine, Michigan, and New Hampshire) by 2016. Our final sample size was
      7258 women. We utilized 95% confidence intervals (CI) and a significance level of
      alpha = 0.05. After adjustment for potential confounders, women who resided in
      states with legalized recreational cannabis were significantly more likely to use
      cannabis during the preconception (PR 1.52; 95%CI ranging from 1.28–1.80; p <
      0.001), prenatal (PR 2.21; 95% CI ranging from 1.67–2.94; p < 0.001), and
      postpartum (PR 1.73; 95%CI ranging from 1.30–2.30; p < 0.001) periods, compared
      to women who resided in states without legalized recreational cannabis. Although 
      evidence about the effect of marijuana use during these periods is nascent, these
      findings show potential for increased incidence of child exposure to cannabis.
      Longitudinal research is needed to assess immediate and sustained impacts of
      maternal use before and after state legalization of recreational cannabis.

TI  - Advanced Strategies for Production of Natural Products in Yeast.
LID - 100879
AB  - Natural products account for more than 50% of all small-molecule pharmaceutical
      agents currently in clinical use. However, low availability often becomes
      problematic when a bioactive natural product is promising to become a
      pharmaceutical or leading compound. Advances in synthetic biology and metabolic
      engineering provide a feasible solution for sustainable supply of these
      compounds. In this review, we have summarized current progress in engineering
      yeast cell factories for production of natural products, including terpenoids,
      alkaloids, and phenylpropanoids. We then discuss advanced strategies in metabolic
      engineering at three different dimensions, including point, line, and plane
      (corresponding to the individual enzymes and cofactors, metabolic pathways, and
      the global cellular network). In particular, we comprehensively discuss how to
      engineer cofactor biosynthesis for enhancing the biosynthesis efficiency, other
      than the enzyme activity. Finally, current challenges and perspective are also
      discussed for future engineering direction.

TI  - ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THERAPEUTIC DRY NEEDLING.
PG  - 103-13
AB  - Background: There is a paucity of literature about the adverse events associated 
      with Therapeutic Dry Needling (TDN). Much of the literature surrounding adverse
      events associated with TDN has been extrapolated from the acupuncture literature.
      Given that acupuncture and TDN are distinctly different in their application and 
      proposed mechanisms, adverse events associated with TDN should be examined
      specifically. Purpose: To determine and report the type of adverse events
      associated with the utilization of TDN. Study Design: Prospective Questionnaire
      Methods: Four hundred and twenty physical therapists participated in this study. 
      Information related to minor and major adverse events that occurred during 20,464
      TDN treatment sessions was collected. Each physical therapist respondent was
      asked to fill out two weekly self-reported electronic surveys over a six-week
      period. One survey was related to “minor adverse events” (i.e. pain, bleeding,
      bruising), while the other was related to “major adverse events” (i.e.
      pneumothorax, excessive bleeding, prolonged aggravation). Following the six-week 
      period, descriptive statistics were used to describe the adverse events (AE)
      associated with TDN and calculate the frequencies of those events. Results: A
      total of 7,531 minor AE's were reported, indicating that 36.7% of the reported
      TDN treatments resulted in a minor AE. The top three minor AE's were bleeding
      (16%), bruising (7.7%), and pain during dry needling (5.9 %). The average ratio
      of minor AE's for all respondents across all weeks was 0.53 or approximately one 
      event for every two patients. Twenty major AE's were reported out of the 20,494
      treatments for a rate of <0.1% (1 per 1,024 TDN treatments). No associations were
      noted between the frequency of adverse events and the number of patients treated,
      practitioner age, level of education, years in practice, level of training or
      months experience with dry needling. Conclusion: Expected minor AE's such as mild
      bleeding, bruising, and pain during TDN were common and major AE's were rare.
      Physical therapists and other medical practitioners need to be aware of the risks
      of TDN. Based on the findings of this study the overall risk of a major adverse
      event during TDN is small. Level of Evidence: 3, survey research

TI  - LOWER EXTREMITY AEROBIC EXERCISE AS A TREATMENT FOR SHOULDER PAIN.
PG  - 74-80
AB  - Background: Shoulder girdle pain is a common disabling complaint with a high
      lifetime prevalence. Interventions aimed at decreasing shoulder pain without
      stressing shoulder girdle structures have the potential to improve participation 
      in multimodal shoulder rehabilitation programs. Hypothesis/Purpose: The aim of
      this study was to determine the acute effects of moderate intensity lower
      extremity exercise on mechanically induced shoulder pain in individuals without
      shoulder injury. It was hypothesized that participants would exhibit less
      shoulder pain, as indicated by increased pain thresholds, following lower
      extremity exercise. Study Design: Repeated measures study. Methods: Thirty (30)
      healthy participants were recruited to participate in this study. Pain pressure
      algometry was used to mechanically induce shoulder pain over the infraspinatus
      muscle belly. This was performed on the dominant shoulder before and immediately 
      after performing 10 minutes of moderate intensity lower extremity exercise using 
      a recumbent exercise machine. Heart rate and rate of perceived exertion were
      measured following exercise. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare pain
      pressure threshold scores between the baseline and post-exercise time points.
      Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05 a priori. Effect size (ES) was calculated using 
      Glass's Δ. Results: Moderate intensity lower extremity aerobic exercise led to
      significantly (F = 8.471, p = 0.003) decreased evoked shoulder pain in healthy
      adults with moderate effect sizes (0.30-0.43). Conclusions: Lower extremity
      aerobic exercise significantly decreased pain of the infraspinatus in this sample
      of young healthy participants. Utilization of lower extremity exercise may be of

TI  - The Opioid System and Food Intake: Use of Opiate Antagonists in Treatment of
      Binge Eating Disorder and Abnormal Eating Behavior.
PG  - 41-63
AB  - Eating disorders (EDs) and substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly co-occur,
      especially in conjunction with affective syndromes, yet little is known about
      opiate abuse and ED symptoms in patients on naltrexone-bupropion therapy.
      Moreover, evidence suggests that the opioid system can also be regarded as one of
      the major systems regulating the anticipatory processes preceding binge eating
      episodes. The lack of evidence in the effectiveness of psychotherapy treatment in
      addition to psychotropic mediations compounds the difficulties in stabilizing
      individuals with EDs. This article aims to exhaustively review literature
      relating to the use of opioid antagonists in the management of binge eating
      disorder (BED) and other abnormal eating habits and how this can be augmented by 
      the use of psychological approaches to come up with the most effective therapy or
      combination of therapies to manage these conditions. Although this approach is
      promising, it has not been evaluated. A review of the literature pertaining to
      the use of naltrexone in patients with EDs was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO
      and MEDLINE. We selected 63 relevant articles published between 1981 and 2018 and
      those written in English. Search terms included “Opioid antagonists”,
      “naltrexone”, “bupropion” and “Psychotherapy” each combined with “Binge Eating
      Disorder”, “Bulimia Nervosa”, “Anorexia Nervosa”, “Eating Disorder”, “EDNOS” and 
      “Obesity”. While working with these articles, we also identified several problems
      related to use of these methods in real clinical practice. Seventy-seven articles
      were reviewed, and 63 were selected for inclusion. Data obtained from these
      sources confirmed that the blockade of opioid receptors diminishes food intake.
      More recent findings also indicate that the combination of bupropion and
      naltrexone can induce weight loss. Augmentation of this by introducing
      psychotherapy may lead to better outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was
      the most frequently recommended psychotherapy intervention, showing efficacy for 
      EDs and chemical addictions as documented by most of the studies, but with
      uncertain efficacy when utilized as augmentation strategy. There are limited data
      supporting the use of psychotherapy in augmentation of standard therapy in ED;
      however, there is evidence to support that psychotherapy is safe in this
      population and has been effective in cases of patients with opiate addiction with
      and without psychiatric comorbidities as well as BED. More research is needed to 
      establish treatment guidelines. Combining pharmacotherapeutic and
      psychotherapeutic interventions leads to the achievement of a better outcome in
      managing patients with EDs. Involving families or the use of support groups
      increases chances of adherence to the prescribed interventions resulting in
      higher rates of remission. However, it is clear that all of these interventions
      must occur in the context of a comprehensive treatment program. We believe that
      patient-specific psychotherapy may not only facilitate the treatment process, but
      also cause significant alterations in eating pattern. This approach for BED may
      lead to more significant treatment outcomes, but this possibility must be tested 
      in larger samples.

TI  - Enhanced ambulatory male urethral surgery: a pathway to successful outpatient
      urethroplasty.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - Background: Length of stay following anterior urethroplasty (AU) surgery has
      progressively shortened over the past two decades with most patients discharging 
      the day of surgery or following overnight observation. We sought to assess
      overall analgesia and patient satisfaction with same-day discharge after AU
      surgery. Methods: Our prospectively maintained anterior urethroplasty database
      was reviewed. Men were identified who underwent anterior urethroplasty surgery by
      a single surgeon (B.R.V.) with the Enhanced Ambulatory Male Urethral Surgery
      (EAMUS) protocol followed by same-day discharge. Patients were contacted within 3
      weeks of surgery and completed validated assessment tools to characterize
      satisfaction with the outpatient experience and with analgesia management. A
      statistical analysis was performed to assess predictors of overall satisfaction
      with same-day discharge following AU surgery. Results: Fifty-seven patients with 
      median age 52.2 years underwent same-day AU surgery between August 2017 and
      October 2018. In total, 46 patients (80.7%) responded to post-discharge surveys
      assessing overall outpatient satisfaction and satisfaction with analgesia. Median
      satisfaction with outpatient experience (scale 1–5) was 5 (IQR 4, 5) with 93.4%
      of patients indicating they were satisfied to very satisfied (4 or 5). Median
      patient satisfaction with analgesia (scale 1–6) was 6 (IQR 5, 6) with 93.4% of
      patients indicating a satisfaction with analgesia score of ≥5 (satisfied to very 
      satisfied). Median number of 5 mg oxycodone tablets used following discharge was 
      3 (IQR 0.75, 5). Postoperative complications occurred in 14 patients (25%) with
      12 (86%) being low grade complications (Clavien-Dindo Classification ≤ II).
      Conclusions: With appropriate preoperative education and peri-operative
      analgesia, anterior urethroplasty surgery can be performed with same-day
      discharge with comparable postoperative complication rates while maintaining
      excellent patient satisfaction. Additional high volume, prospectively collected
      studies are necessary to verify short-term satisfaction rates while confirming
      long-term urethroplasty success rates remain comparable to AU surgery performed
      with next day discharge.

TI  - Variables associated with use of symptomatic medication during a headache attack 
      in individuals with tension-type headache: a European study.
LID - 43
AB  - Background: Pharmacological treatment of patients with tension-type headache
      (TTH) includes symptomatic (acute) and prophylactic (preventive) medication. No
      previous study has investigated variables associated to symptomatic medication
      intake in TTH. Our aim was to assess the association of clinical, psychological
      and neurophysiological outcomes with the use and timing of the use of symptomatic
      medication in TTH. Methods: A longitudinal observational study was conducted. One
      hundred and sixty-eight (n = 168) patients with TTH participated. Pain features
      of the headache (intensity, frequency, duration), burden of headache (Headache
      Disability Inventory), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index),
      anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), trait/state anxiety
      levels (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and bilateral pressure pain thresholds on
      the temporalis, C5-C6 joint, second metacarpal and tibialis anterior were
      assessed. Symptomatic medication intake was also collected for a 6-months
      follow-up period. Differences between patients using or not using symptomatic
      medication, depending on self-perceived effectiveness, and time (early during an 
      attack, i.e., the first 5 min, or when headache attack is intense) when the
      symptomatic medication was taken were calculated. Results: One hundred and
      thirty-six (n = 136, 80%) reported symptomatic medication intake for headache
      (73% NSAIDs). Sixteen (12%) reported no pain relief, 81 (59%) experienced
      moderate relief and 39 (29%) total pain relief. Fifty-eight (43%) took ‘early
      medication’ whereas 78 (57%) took ‘late medication’. Patients taking symptomatic 
      medication in general showed lower headache frequency and lower depressive levels
      than those patients not taking medication. Symptomatic medication was more
      effective in patients with lower headache history, frequency, and duration, and
      lower emotional burden. No differences in pressure pain sensitivity were found
      depending on the self-perceived effectiveness of medication. Patients taking
      ‘late symptomatic’ medication exhibited more widespread pressure pain sensitivity
      than those taking ‘early medication’. Conclusions: This study found that the
      effectiveness of symptomatic medication was associated with better headache
      parameters (history, frequency, or duration) and lower emotional burden. Further,
      consuming early symptomatic medication at the beginning of a headache attack (the
      first 5 min) could limit widespread pressure pain sensitivity.

TI  - A Novel G Protein–Biased Agonist at the δ Opioid Receptor with Analgesic Efficacy
      in Models of Chronic Pain.
PG  - 224-36
AB  - Agonists at the δ opioid receptor are known to be potent antihyperalgesics in
      chronic pain models and effective in models of anxiety and depression. However,
      some δ opioid agonists have proconvulsant properties while tolerance to the
      therapeutic effects can develop. Previous evidence indicates that different
      agonists acting at the δ opioid receptor differentially engage signaling and
      regulatory pathways with significant effects on behavioral outcomes. As such,
      interest is now growing in the development of biased agonists as a potential
      means to target specific signaling pathways and potentially improve the
      therapeutic profile of δ opioid agonists. Here, we report on PN6047
      (3-[[4-(dimethylcarbamoyl)phenyl]-[1-(thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-4-piperidylidene]methyl
      ]benzamide), a novel G protein–biased and selective δ opioid agonist. In
      cell-based assays, PN6047 fully engages G protein signaling but is a partial
      agonist in both the arrestin recruitment and internalization assays. PN6047 is
      effective in rodent models of chronic pain but shows no detectable analgesic
      tolerance following prolonged treatment. In addition, PN6047 exhibited
      antidepressant-like activity in the forced swim test, and importantly, the drug
      had no effect on chemically induced seizures. PN6047 did not exhibit reward-like 
      properties in the conditioned place preference test or induce respiratory
      depression. Thus, δ opioid ligands with limited arrestin signaling such as PN6047
      may be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of chronic pain
      states.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: PN6047
      (3-[[4-(dimethylcarbamoyl)phenyl]-[1-(thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-4-piperidylidene]methyl
      ]benzamide) is a selective, G protein–biased δ opioid agonist with efficacy in
      preclinical models of chronic pain. No analgesic tolerance was observed after
      prolonged treatment, and PN6047 does not display proconvulsant activity or other 
      opioid-mediated adverse effects. Our data suggest that δ opioid ligands with
      limited arrestin signaling will be beneficial in the treatment of chronic pain.

TI  - Polysubstance Use: A Broader Understanding of Substance Use During the Opioid
      Crisis.
PG  - 244-50
AB  - Objectives. To understand important changes in co-occurring opioid and nonopioid 
      drug use (i.e., polysubstance use) within the opioid epidemic in the United
      States.Methods. We analyzed survey data on the past month co-use of prescription 
      and illicit opioids and 12 nonopioid psychoactive drug classes from a national
      sample of 15 741 persons entering treatment of opioid use disorder.Results.
      Past-month illicit opioid use increased from 44.8% in 2011 to 70.1% in 2018,
      while the use of prescription opioids alone dropped from 55.2% to 29.9%, yet
      overall remained high (94.5% to 85.2%). Past-month use of at least 1 nonopioid
      drug occurred in nearly all participants (> 90%), with significant increases in
      methamphetamine (+85%) and decreases across nonopioid prescription drug classes
      (range: −40% to –68%).Conclusions. Viewing opioid trends in a “silo” ignores the 
      fact not only that polysubstance use is ubiquitous among those with opioid use
      disorder but also that significant changes in polysubstance use should be
      monitored alongside opioid trends.Public Health Implications. Treatment,
      prevention, and policymaking must address not only the supply and demand of a
      singular drug class but also the global nature of substance use overall.

      Care Setting.
LID - e6829
AB  - Opioid antagonists in the ICU are often a last-line medication given to patients 
      with opioid-induced constipation. Traditionally, patients have been administered 
      nonopioid-based bowel regimens such as senna, peg, and docusate to treat
      constipation. Despite the obvious need to treat acute pain with opioids, side
      effects such as constipation can lead to multiple gastrointestinal (GI)
      complications such as bowel perforation and even death. Specifically,
      opioid-induced constipation (OIC) can be very difficult to treat. We examine
      naloxone and methylnaltrexone (MNTX) assessing GI complications and OIC as well
      as present a patient case which highlights the importance of treating OIC. We
      also evaluate the superior reversal agent of choice when treating OIC in the
      critical care and stepdown unit settings.

TI  - Association Between a State Law Allowing Pharmacists to Dispense Naloxone Without
      a Prescription and Naloxone Dispensing Rates.
LID - e1920310
AB  - Question: Is an Ohio law allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a
      prescription in accordance with a physician-approved protocol associated with an 
      increase in naloxone dispensing rates? Findings: In this cohort study of patients
      in Ohio who received naloxone, the number of naloxone orders dispensed after the 
      state law was implemented increased by 2328%, and the naloxone dispensing rate
      per month per county increased significantly in the Ohio Medicaid (4%) and Kroger
      Pharmacy (3%) populations. In the Ohio Medicaid population, the naloxone
      dispensing rate in low-employment counties increased by 18% compared with
      high-employment counties. Meaning: The implementation of an Ohio law allowing
      pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a prescription was associated with a
      significant increase in naloxone dispensing rates, especially in low-employment
      counties.

TI  - Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder in Pregnant Women via Telemedicine: A
      Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.
LID - e1920177
AB  - Question: Is opioid use disorder treatment received via telemedicine in obstetric
      practices associated with similar maternal and newborn outcomes compared with
      opioid use disorder treatment received in person in obstetric practices?
      Findings: In this nonrandomized controlled trial including 98 pregnant women with
      opioid use disorder, there were no statistically significant differences in rates
      of retention in treatment between women receiving opioid use disorder treatment
      via telemedicine vs in person (80.4% vs 92.7%). These findings were also apparent
      in newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome (telemedicine: 45.4% vs in person: 
      63.2%). Meaning: Telemedicine may provide a scalable solution to making
      lifesaving treatment available to pregnant women to reduce the maternal morbidity
      and mortality associated with opioid use disorder and improve maternal and child 
      health.

TI  - TLR4-Targeting Therapeutics: Structural Basis and Computer-Aided Drug Discovery
      Approaches.
LID - 627
AB  - The integration of computational techniques into drug development has led to a
      substantial increase in the knowledge of structural, chemical, and biological
      data. These techniques are useful for handling the big data generated by
      empirical and clinical studies. Over the last few years, computer-aided drug
      discovery methods such as virtual screening, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative
      structure-activity relationship analysis, and molecular docking have been
      employed by pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers for the development
      of pharmacologically active drugs. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a vital role
      in various inflammatory, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders such as
      sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
      multiple sclerosis, cancer, and systemic lupus erythematosus. TLRs, particularly 
      TLR4, have been identified as potential drug targets for the treatment of these
      diseases, and several relevant compounds are under preclinical and clinical
      evaluation. This review covers the reported computational studies and techniques 
      that have provided insights into TLR4-targeting therapeutics. Furthermore, this
      article provides an overview of the computational methods that can benefit a
      broad audience in this field and help with the development of novel drugs for
      TLR-related disorders.

TI  - Synaptotagmin 1 Is Involved in Neuropathic Pain and Electroacupuncture-Mediated
      Analgesic Effect.
LID - 968
AB  - Numerous studies have verified that electroacupuncture (EA) can relieve
      neuropathic pain through a variety of mechanisms. Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt-1), a
      synaptic vesicle protein for regulating exocytosis of neurotransmitters, was
      found to be affected by EA stimulation. However, the roles of Syt-1 in
      neuropathic pain and EA-induced analgesic effect remain unclear. Here, the effect
      of Syt-1 on nociception was assessed through an antibody blockade, siRNA
      silencing, and lentivirus-mediated overexpression of spinal Syt-1 in rats with
      spared nerve injury (SNI). EA was used for stimulating bilateral “Sanjinjiao” and
      “Zusanli” acupoints of the SNI rats to evaluate its effect on nociceptive
      thresholds and spinal Syt-1 expression. The mechanically and thermally
      nociceptive behaviors were assessed with paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw
      withdrawal latency (PWL) at different temperatures, respectively, at day 0, 7, 8,
      14, and 20. Syt-1 mRNA and protein levels were determined with qRT-PCR and
      Western blot, respectively, and its distribution was observed with the
      immunohistochemistry method. The results demonstrated Syt-1 antibody blockade and
      siRNA silencing increased ipsilateral PWTs and PWLs of SNI rats, while Syt-1
      overexpression decreased ipsilateral PWTs and PWLs of rats. EA significantly
      attenuated nociceptive behaviors and down-regulated spinal Syt-1 protein levels
      (especially in laminae I-II), which were reversed by Syt-1 overexpression. Our
      findings firstly indicate that Syt-1 is involved in the development of
      neuropathic pain and that EA attenuates neuropathic pain, probably through
      suppressing Syt-1 protein expression in the spinal cord.

TI  - Monitoring Consumption of Common Illicit Drugs in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, by
      Wastewater-Cased Epidemiology.
LID - 889
AB  - Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia play a major role in global drug
      trade and abuse. Use of amphetamine-type stimulants has increased in the past
      decade in Malaysia. This study aimed to apply wastewater-based epidemiology for
      the first time in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to estimate the consumption of common
      illicit drugs in urban population. Influent wastewater samples were collected
      from two wastewater treatment plants in Kuala Lumpur in the summer of 2017.
      Concentrations of twenty-four drug biomarkers were analyzed for estimating drug
      consumption. Fourteen drug residues were detected with concentrations of up to
      1640 ng/L. Among the monitored illicit drugs, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine 
      (MDMA) or ecstasy had the highest estimated per capita consumptions. Consumption 
      and dose of amphetamine-type stimulants (methamphetamine and MDMA) were both an
      order of magnitude higher than those of opioids (heroin and codeine, methadone
      and tramadol). Amphetamine-type stimulants were the most prevalent drugs,
      replacing opioids in the drug market. The prevalence trend measured by
      wastewater-based epidemiology data reflected the shift to amphetamine-type
      stimulants as reported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Narcotics
      Cooperation Center. Most of the undetected drug residues were new psychoactive
      substances (NPSs), suggesting a low prevalence of NPSs in the drug market.

TI  - Significant Quantitative Differences in Orexin Neuronal Activation After Pain
      Assessments in an Animal Model of Sickle Cell Disease.
LID - 5
AB  - Sickle cell disease is a hemoglobinopathy that causes sickling of red blood
      cells, resulting in vessel blockage, stroke, anemia, inflammation, and extreme
      pain. The development and treatment of pain, in particular, neuropathic pain in
      sickle cell disease patients is poorly understood and impedes our progress toward
      the development of novel therapies to treat pain associated with sickle cell
      disease. The orexin/hypocretin system offers a novel approach to treat chronic
      pain and hyperalgesia. These neuropeptides are synthesized in three regions:
      perifornical area (PFA), lateral hypothalamus (LH), and dorsomedial hypothalamus 
      (DMH). Data suggest that orexin–A neuropeptide has an analgesic effect on
      inflammatory pain and may affect mechanisms underlying the maintenance of
      neuropathic pain. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are
      neuronal activation differences in the orexin system as a result of neuropathic
      pain testing in a mouse model of sickle cell disease. Female transgenic sickle
      mice that express exclusively (99%) human sickle hemoglobin (HbSS-BERK) and
      age-/gender-matched controls (HbAA-BERK mice; n = 10/group, 20–30 g) expressing
      normal human hemoglobin A were habituated to each test protocol and environment
      before collecting baseline measurements and testing. Four measures were used to
      assess pain-related behaviors: thermal/heat hyperalgesia, cold hyperalgesia,
      mechanical hyperalgesia, and deep-tissue hyperalgesia. Hypothalamic brain
      sections from HbAA-BERK and HbSS-BERK mice were processed to visualize orexin and
      c-Fos immunoreactivity and quantified. The percentage of double labeled neurons
      in the PFA was significantly higher than the percentage of double labeled neurons
      in the LH orexin field of HbAA-BERK mice (*p < 0.05). The percentages of double
      labeled neurons in PFA and DMH orexin fields are significantly higher than those 
      neurons in the LH of HbSS-BERK mice (*p < 0.05). These data suggest that DMH
      orexin neurons were preferentially recruited during neuropathic pain testing and 
      a more diverse distribution of orexin neurons may be required to produce
      analgesia in response to pain in the HbSS-BERK mice. Identifying specific orexin 
      neuronal populations that are integral in neuropathic pain processing will allow 
      us to elucidate mechanisms that provide a more selective, targeted approach in
      treating of neuropathic pain in sickle cell disease.

TI  - Opioid Prescribing Behaviors — Prescription Behavior Surveillance System, 11
      States, 2010–2016.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Problem/Condition: In 2017, a total of 70,237 persons in the United States died
      from a drug overdose, and 67.8% of these deaths involved an opioid. Historically,
      the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States has been closely associated
      with a parallel increase in opioid prescribing and with widespread misuse of
      these medications. National and state policy makers have introduced multiple
      measures to attempt to assess and control the opioid overdose epidemic since
      2010, including improvements in surveillance systems. Period Covered: 2010–2016
      Description of System: The Prescription Behavior Surveillance System (PBSS) was
      created in 2011. Its goal was to track rates of prescribing of controlled
      substances and possible misuse of such drugs using data from selected state
      prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP). PBSS data measure prescribing
      behaviors for prescription opioids using multiple measures calculated from PDMP
      data including 1) opioid prescribing, 2) average daily opioid dosage, 3)
      proportion of patients with daily opioid dosages ≥90 morphine milligram
      equivalents, 4) overlapping opioid prescriptions, 5) overlapping opioid and
      benzodiazepine prescriptions, and 6) multiple-provider episodes. For this
      analysis, PBSS data were available for 2010–2016 from 11 states representing
      approximately 38.0% of the U.S. population. Average quarterly percent changes
      (AQPC) in the rates of opioid prescribing and possible opioid misuse measures
      were calculated for each state. Results and Interpretation: Opioid prescribing
      rates declined in all 11 states during 2010–2016 (range: 14.9% to 33.0%). Daily
      dosage declined least (AQPC: -0.4%) in Idaho and Maine, and most (AQPC: -1.6%) in
      Florida. The percentage of patients with high daily dosage had AQPCs ranging from
      -0.4% in Idaho to -2.3% in Louisiana. Multiple-provider episode rates declined by
      at least 62% in the seven states with available data. Variations in trends across
      the 11 states might reflect differences in state policies and possible
      differential effects of similar policies. Public Health Actions: Use of PDMP data
      from individual states enables a more detailed examination of trends in opioid
      prescribing behaviors and indicators of possible misuse than is feasible with
      national commercially available prescription data. Comparison of opioid
      prescribing trends among states can be used to monitor the temporal association
      of national or state policy interventions and might help public health
      policymakers recognize changes in the use or possible misuse of controlled
      prescription drugs over time and allow for prompt intervention through amended or
      new opioid-related policies.

TI  - NF-κB Duplications in the Promoter-Variant HIV-1C LTR Impact Inflammation Without
      Altering Viral Replication in the Context of Simian Human Immunodeficiency
      Viruses and Opioid-Exposure.
LID - 95
AB  - Recent spread of the promoter variant (4-κB) Human immunodeficiency virus-1 clade
      C (HIV-1C) strain is attributed to duplication of the Nuclear Factor Kappa B
      (NF-κB) binding sites and potential increased heroin consumption in India. To
      study the underlying biology of 4-κB HIV-1C in rhesus macaques, we engineered a
      promoter-chimera variant (4NF-κB) Simian Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SHIV) by
      substituting the HIV-1C Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) region consisting of 4 NF-κB
      and 3 Sp-1 sites with the corresponding segment in the LTR of SHIV AD8EO. The
      wild-type (3NF-κB) promoter-chimera SHIV was generated by inactivating the 5′
      proximal NF-κB binding site in SHIV 4NF-κB. CD8-depleted rhesus macaque PBMCs
      (RM-PBMCs) were infected with the promoter-chimera and AD8EO SHIVs to determine
      the effects of opioid-exposure on inflammation, NF-κB activation, neurotoxicity
      in neuronal cells and viral replication. Morphine-exposure of RM-PBMCs infected
      with SHIVs 4NF-κB, 3NF-κB, and AD8EO altered cellular transcript levels of
      monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and Tumor
      Necrosis Factor α. Of note, divergent alteration of the cytokine transcript
      levels was observed with these promoter-chimera wild-type and variant SHIVs.
      NF-κB activation was observed during infection of all three SHIVs with
      morphine-exposure. Finally, we observed that SHIV AD8EO infection and exposure to
      both morphine and naloxone had the greatest impact on the neurotoxicity. The
      promoter-chimera SHIV 4NF-κB and SHIV 3NF-κB did not have a similar effect on
      neurotoxicity as compared to SHIV AD8EO. All SHIVs replicated efficiently at
      comparable levels in RM-PBMCs and morphine-exposure did not alter viral
      replication kinetics. Future in vivo studies in rhesus macaques will provide
      greater understanding of 4-κB HIV-1C viral immunopathogenesis and onset of
      disease in the central nervous system during morphine-exposure.

TI  - Bidirectional Regulation of Opioid and Chemokine Function.
LID - 94
AB  - The opioid family of GPCRs consists of the classical opioid receptors, designated
      μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors, and the orphanin-FQ receptor, and these proteins 
      are expressed on both neuronal and hematopoietic cells. A number of laboratories 
      have reported that an important degree of cross-talk can occur between the opioid
      receptors and the chemokine and chemokine receptor families. As a part of this,
      the opioid receptors are known to regulate the expression of certain chemokines
      and chemokine receptors, including those that possess strong pro-inflammatory
      activity. At the level of receptor function, it is clear that certain members of 
      the chemokine family can mediate cross-desensitization of the opioid receptors.
      Conversely, the opioid receptors are all able to induce heterologous
      desensitization of some of the chemokine receptors. Consequently, activation of
      one or more of the opioid receptors can selectively cross-desensitize chemokine
      receptors and regulate chemokine function. These cross-talk processes have
      significant implications for the inflammatory response, since the regulation of
      both the recruitment of inflammatory cells, as well as the sensation of pain, can
      be controlled in this way.

TI  - Strategies for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease: Beyond Dopamine.
LID - 4
AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second-leading cause of dementia and is
      characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
      nigra alongside the presence of intraneuronal α-synuclein-positive inclusions.
      Therapies to date have been directed to the restoration of the dopaminergic
      system, and the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal cell death in the midbrain.
      This review discusses the physiological mechanisms involved in PD as well as new 
      and prospective therapies for the disease. The current data suggest that
      prevention or early treatment of PD may be the most effective therapeutic
      strategy. New advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of PD
      predict the development of more personalized and integral therapies in the years 
      to come. Thus, the development of more reliable biomarkers at asymptomatic stages
      of the disease, and the use of genetic profiling of patients will surely permit a
      more effective treatment of PD.

TI  - Changes in Muscle Activity Patterns and Joint Kinematics During Gait in
      Hemophilic Arthropathy.
LID - 1575
AB  - Hemophilic arthropathy is the result of repetitive intra-articular bleeding and
      synovial inflammation. In people with hemophilic arthropathy (PWHA), very little 
      is known about the neural control of individual muscles during movement. The aim 
      of the present study was to assess if the neural control of individual muscles
      and coordination between antagonistic muscle pairs and joint kinematics during
      gait are affected in PWHA. Thirteen control subjects (CG) walked overground at
      their preferred and slow velocity (1 m/s), and 14 PWHA walked overground at the
      preferred velocity (1 m/s). Joint kinematics and temporal gait parameters were
      assessed using four inertial sensors. Surface electromyography (EMG) was
      collected from gluteus maximus (GMAX), gluteus medius (GMED), vastus medialis
      (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), medial gastrocnemius (MG),
      lateral gastrocnemius (LG), soleus (SOL), tibialis anterior (TA), semitendinosus 
      (ST), and biceps femoris (BF). Waveforms were compared using the time-series
      analysis through statistical parametric mapping. In PWHA compared to CG, EMG
      amplitude during the stance phase was higher for LG (for both velocities of the
      CG), BF (slow velocity only), and ST (preferred velocity only) (p < 0.05).
      Co-contraction during the stance phase was higher for MG-TA, LG-TA, VL-BF, VM-ST,
      LG-VL, and MG-VM (both velocities) (p < 0.05). MG and LG were excited earlier
      (preferred velocity only) (p < 0.05). A later offset during the stance phase was 
      found for VL, BF, and ST (both velocities), and BF and GMAX (preferred velocity
      only) (p < 0.05). In addition, the range of motion in knee and ankle joints was
      lower in PWHA (both velocities) and hip joint (preferred velocity only) (p <
      0.05). In conclusion, the neural control of individual muscles and coordination
      between antagonistic muscles during gait in PWHA differs substantially from
      control subjects.

TI  - Mechanisms of Shared Vulnerability to Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and
      Substance Use Disorders.
LID - 6
AB  - Psychoactive substance use is a nearly universal human behavior, but a
      significant minority of people who use addictive substances will go on to develop
      an addictive disorder. Similarly, though ~90% of people experience traumatic
      events in their lifetime, only ~10% ever develop post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Substance use disorders (SUD) and PTSD are highly comorbid, occurring in 
      the same individual far more often than would be predicted by chance given the
      respective prevalence of each disorder. Some possible reasons that have been
      proposed for the relationship between PTSD and SUD are self-medication of anxiety
      with drugs or alcohol, increased exposure to traumatic events due to activities
      involved in acquiring illegal substances, or addictive substances altering the
      brain’s stress response systems to make users more vulnerable to PTSD. Yet
      another possibility is that some people have an intrinsic vulnerability that
      predisposes them to both PTSD and SUD. In this review, we integrate clinical and 
      animal data to explore these possible etiological links between SUD and PTSD,
      with an emphasis on interactions between dopaminergic, adrenocorticotropic,
      GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurobehavioral mechanisms that underlie different
      emotional learning styles.

TI  - 3D Exoscopic Surgery (3Des) for Transoral Oropharyngectomy.
LID - 16
AB  - Over the past three decades, the incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell
      carcinoma has increased, primarily related to the spread of human papillomavirus.
      Treatment has always been preferentially unimodal (surgery or radiotherapy) for
      early stage disease and multimodal (surgery with adjuvant therapy or concomitant 
      chemoradiotherapy) for advanced stages. Recently, the surgical approach has
      gained renewed interest due to the morbidity of non-surgical treatments and also 
      to technical innovations. We have coined the term 3Des (3D exoscope surgery) to
      describe the use of the 3D Vitom Exoscope System for transoral surgery of
      oropharyngeal cancers. During the period from June 2017 to May 2018, 10 patients 
      with oropharyngeal cancer were treated by oropharyngeal surgery with the 3Des
      approach at FPO IRCCS Institute of Candiolo. The aim of the present prospective
      study was to evaluate the utility of 3Des for the treatment of early-stage
      oropharyngeal cancer. 3Des could represent a viable alternative to the operating 
      microscope and robotic surgery thanks to its excellent ability to provide 3D
      visual information, depth of field, magnification, image contrast, color imaging,
      and low running costs. It promises great utility in the learning process, with
      the possibility of recording in high definition.

TI  - Childhood Trauma, Cognitive Emotion Regulation and Motivation for Behavior Change
      Among Clients of Opioid Substitution Treatment With and Without Past Year
      Synthetic Cathinone Use During Therapy.
LID - 37
AB  - Background: With a decrease in heroin’s purity and availability in the European
      drug market, Hungarian opioid dependent patients started to substitute heroin
      with novel psychoactive substances (NPS) and especially with synthetic
      cathinones. Goal: This study aims to assess whether clients of opioid
      substitution treatment (OST) with and without a history of synthetic cathinone
      use during therapy differ in (1) the rate and type of experienced childhood
      trauma, (2) the way they cope with negative life events, (3) their motivation to 
      change substance use behavior, (4) the rate of treatment retention. Methods: A
      total of 198 clients of an outpatient centers (Nyírõ Gyula National Institute of 
      Psychiatry and Addictions, Budapest) OST were asked to provide information about 
      their general substance use experiences, including the consumption of NPS during 
      treatment, their childhood traumatic experiences (Childhood Trauma
      Questionnaire), cognitive emotion regulation strategies (Cognitive Emotion
      Regulation Questionnaire), their motivation to change substance use behavior
      (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale) and current psychiatric
      symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory). Baseline data was collected in the summer of 
      2015, while 4 years follow-up data on treatment retention was obtained in the
      summer of 2019. Results: The majority of the clients were male (N = 141, 71.2%), 
      receiving methadone as a substitute for opioids (N = 178, 89.9%), while mean age 
      of the full sample was 39.7 (SD = 6.8). Based on a logistic regression model, the
      odds for past year synthetic cathinone use was higher among clients with more
      severe psychiatric symptoms (B = 0.8, OR = 2.2, p < 0.01) and among clients who
      were in treatment for a shorter period of time (B = 0.1, OR = 0.9, p < 0.05).
      Synthetic cathinone use during treatment was further associated with less
      adaptive strategies to cope with negative life events. Synthetic cathinone use
      was also a risk factor for reduced treatment retention (B = −0.8, OR = 0.4, p <
      0.05) and was associated with lower odds of being member of a latent class with
      less severe psychopathological profile (B = −0.9, OR = 0.4, p < 0.05).
      Conclusion: Synthetic cathinone use during treatment is associated with poorer
      treatment outcomes and might be characterized by more severe psychiatric symptoms
      and amotivation to change substance use among opioid dependent clients.

TI  - Effect of Expectation on Pain Processing: A Psychophysics and Functional MRI
      Analysis.
LID - 6
AB  - Pain is a complex phenomenon that is highly modifiable by expectation. Whilst the
      intensity of incoming noxious information plays a key role in the intensity of
      perceived pain, this intensity can be profoundly shaped by an individual’s
      expectations. Modern brain imaging investigations have begun to detail the brain 
      regions responsible for placebo and nocebo related changes in pain, but less is
      known about the neural basis of stimulus-expectancy changes in pain processing.
      In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we administered two separate
      protocols of the same noxious thermal stimuli to 24 healthy subjects. However,
      different expectations were elicited by different explanations to subjects prior 
      to each protocol. During one protocol, pain intensities were matched to
      expectation and in the other protocol they were not. Pain intensity was measured 
      continuously via a manually operated computerized visual analogue scale. When
      individuals expected the stimulus intensity to remain constant, but in reality it
      was surreptitiously increased or decreased, pain intensity ratings were
      significantly lower than when expectation and pain intensities were matched. When
      the stimulus intensities did not match expectations, various areas in the brain
      such as the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (dlPFC), and the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) displayed
      significantly different patterns of activity compared to instances when stimulus 
      intensity and pain expectations were matched. These results show that
      stimulus-expectancy manipulation of pain intensity alters activity in both higher
      brain and brainstem centers which are known to modulate pain under various
      conditions.

LID - e18939
AB  - Rationale:: Diagnosing and treating refractory cancer pain have become
      standardized and effective procedures with guidance from the Expert Consensus on 
      Refractory Cancer Pain released in 2017 by the Committee of Rehabilitation and
      Palliative Care of China. Doxorubicin has been used for perineural injection in
      the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain owing to its retrograde sensory ganglion
      resection effect. Our study reports a new fourth-ladder treatment for cancer
      pain: CT-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection for patients with refractory 
      cancer pain caused by paraspinal metastasis. Patient concerns:: A 48-year-old
      female and a 47-year-old male patients suffered from refractory cancer pain over 
      the past months. They had both undergone surgical tumor resection, chemotherapy, 
      and precision radiotherapy but result in limited analgesic effect. The daily oral
      morphine dosage was around 60 to 100 mg and rescue analgesic methods had been
      used at the time. Diagnoses:: Refractory cancer pain in 2 patients with renal
      cancer and hepatobiliary adenocarcinoma. Interventions:: The patients both
      received computed tomography (CT)-guided 1 mL of 0.5% doxorubicin paravertebral
      injection at each affected nerve root segments. Outcomes:: The Visual Analog
      Scale and Douleur Neuropathique four Questions were used for 6-month follow-up,
      and the analgesic requirement was also recorded. The patients enjoyed
      satisfactory analgesia for up to 6 months without adverse reaction. In addition, 
      the oral opioid analgesic doses were significantly reduced after the neurolytic
      block. Lessons:: The CT-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection was an
      effective fourth-step analgesic interventional technology that allowed our 2
      patients with refractory cancer pain to maintain satisfactory analgesia. This
      analgesia method taken at an appropriate stage, according to the latest analgesic
      concept, results in good analgesia and opioid use reduction. Also, with the
      imaging guidance, only a small amount of neurolytic agent is needed to achieve
      analgesia in a precise and safe way.

TI  - Increased risk of perforated appendicitis in patients with schizophrenia and
      dementia: A population-based case-control study.
LID - e18919
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that patients with psychotic or mental disorders 
      are relatively pain insensitive, resulting in difficulties in the diagnosis of
      acute intra-abdominal diseases requiring emergency surgeries. We aimed to
      evaluate whether central nervous system (CNS) or mental disorders are associated 
      with perforated appendicitis in patients with acute appendicitis.We conducted a
      population-based case-control study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance
      Research database. Patients aged >18 years who had been hospitalized with a
      diagnosis of acute appendicitis between 2000 and 2013 were identified. After 1:1 
      matching for age and sex, 2792 patients with perforated appendicitis (case group)
      and 2792 patients with nonperforated appendicitis (control group) were included. 
      CNS disorders, mental disorders, pain control medication, and several
      comorbidities were analyzed for the odds of appendiceal perforation with 95%
      confidence interval (CI) using the multivariable logistic regression
      model.Schizophrenia and dementia were associated with a high risk of appendiceal 
      rupture in patients with acute appendicitis, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.01 
      for dementia (95% CI: 1.19–3.39, P = .009) and 4.8 for schizophrenia (95% CI:
      1.62–14.19, P = .005). Other factors, such as other CNS disorders, comorbidities,
      and pain control medication, were not associated with the risk of perforated
      appendicitis.Dementia and schizophrenia are associated with perforated
      appendicitis in patients with acute appendicitis. This might be owing to altered 
      pain perception, difficult symptom expression, and delayed hospitalization.
      Further studies are still needed to determine the underlying mechanism and
      confirm the causality.

TI  - Adiponectin receptor 1 gene is potentially associated with severity of
      postoperative pain but not cancer pain.
LID - e18924
AB  - Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-derived cytokine that exerts its
      antiinflammatory effects by binding to 2 adiponectin receptors, adiponectin
      receptor 1 (ADIPOR1) and adiponectin receptor 2 (ADIPOR2). However, the role of
      these adiponectin receptors on inflammatory pain remains unclear. We investigated
      the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these genes and
      inflammatory pain, such as postoperative pain and cancer pain.We analyzed 17 SNPs
      of the ADIPOR1 gene and 27 SNPs of the ADIPOR2 gene in 56 adult patients with
      postlaparotomy pain. We compared these genotypes with pain intensity and opioid
      consumption, adjusting for multiple testing. We analyzed the genotypes of 88
      patients with cancer pain and examined the association of the relevant SNP(s)
      with pain intensity and opioid consumption.One variant of the ADIPOR1 gene
      (rs12045862) showed significant association with postoperative pain intensity;
      patients with minor allele homozygote (n = 7) demonstrated significantly worse
      pain intensity than that of combined patient group exhibiting major allele
      homozygote or the heterozygote (n = 49; Mann-Whitney test, P < .00002), although 
      their opioid consumptions were comparable. Cancer pain intensity between minor
      allele homozygote patients (n = 7) and other 2 genotype patients (n = 81) were
      comparable.The rs12045862 SNP of the ADIPOR1 gene was associated with
      postoperative pain but not cancer pain. This might result from functional
      alteration of the ADIPOR1 signalling pathways, which influence the inflammatory
      process. ADIPOR1 may be a novel potential target for developing analgesics of
      postoperative pain.

TI  - Midlife mortality in White non-Hispanic male veterans enrolled in Department of
      Veterans Affairs primary care, 2003–2014.
LID - e03328
AB  - Background: After years of decline in mortality rates in the United States, there
      have been increases in mortality rates in White non-Hispanic Americans ages
      45–54, due to increases in deaths from suicide, poisoning, and alcoholic liver
      disease. Objectives: To determine whether White non-Hispanic middle age male
      Veterans enrolled in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care had
      increased mortality, as found in the general population. Research design:
      Repeated cross-sectional analysis over 12 years to describe trends in death rates
      for men across 3 race/ethnicity groups (White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic,
      Hispanic) and 2 age groups (45–54, 55–64) for the Veteran and general US male
      populations. Subjects: 60 million patient-years for Veterans enrolled in VA
      primary care from 2003 to 2014 and 1.8 million who died during the study period. 
      Measures: All-cause and cause specific death rates for alcoholic liver disease,
      poisoning, and suicide. Results: For White non-Hispanic male Veterans ages 55–64,
      the increase in all-cause mortality from 2003 to 2014 (+309 deaths/100,000) was
      accompanied by significant changes in deaths due to poisoning (+30/100,000),
      alcoholic liver disease (+23/100,000), and suicide (+17/100,000). For US men ages
      55–64, all-cause mortality decreased slightly from 2003-2014 (-22
      deaths/100,000). However, there were increases in death rates due to poisoning
      (+17/100,000), alcoholic liver disease (+14/100,000) and suicide (+11/100,000).
      Conclusions: These disturbing findings for White non-Hispanic Veteran men ages
      55–64 suggest the critical importance of suicide prevention programs as well as
      the importance of high quality integrated health care for both Veteran and
      non-Veteran men.

TI  - Effect of bupivacaine on postoperative pain and analgesics use after
      single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy: double-blind randomized study.
PG  - 96-101
AB  - Purpose: Local anesthetics can decrease postoperative pain after appendectomy.
      This study sought to verify the efficacy of bupivacaine on postoperative pain and
      analgesics use after single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA). Methods:
      Between March 2014 and October 2015, 68 patients with appendicitis agreed to
      participate in this study. After general anesthesia, patients were randomized to 
      bupivacaine or control (normal saline) groups. The assigned drugs were
      infiltrated into subcutaneous tissue and deep into anterior rectus fascia.
      Postoperative analgesics use and pain scores were recorded using visual analogue 
      scale (VAS) by investigators at 1, 8, and 24 hours and on day 7. All surgeons,
      investigators and patients were blinded to group allocation. Results: Thirty
      patients were allocated into the control group and 37 patients into bupivacaine
      group (one patient withdrew consent before starting anesthesia). Seven from the
      control group and 4 from the bupivacaine group were excluded. Thus, 23 patients
      in the control group and 33 in the bupivacaine group completed the study.
      Preoperative demographics and operative findings were similar. Postoperative pain
      and analgesics use were not different between the 2 groups. Subgroup analysis
      determined that VAS pain score at 24 hours was significantly lower in the
      bupivacaine group (2.1) than in the control group (3.8, P = 0.007) when surgery
      exceeded 40 minutes. During immediate postoperative period, bupivacaine group
      needed less opioids (9.1 mg) than control (10.4 mg). Conclusion: Bupivacaine did 
      not decrease pain and analgesics use. When surgery exceeded 40 minutes,
      bupivacaine use might be associated with less pain and less analgesics use.

TI  - Continuous Wound Infiltration of Local Anesthetics in Postoperative Pain
      Management: Safety, Efficacy and Current Perspectives.
PG  - 285-94
AB  - Local infiltration and continuous infusion of surgical wound with anesthetics are
      parts of multimodal analgesia for postoperative pain control. The techniques,
      given the simplicity of execution that does not increase the timing of the
      intervention and does not require additional technical skills, are applied in
      several kinds of surgeries. The continuous wound infiltration can be used for
      days and a variety of continuous delivery methods can be chosen, including
      patient-controlled analgesia, continuous infusion or intermittent bolus. The
      purpose of this narrative review is to analyze the literature, in particular by
      researching the safety, efficacy and current perspectives of continuous wound
      infiltration for postoperative pain management in different surgical settings. We
      have identified 203 articles and 95 of these have been taken into consideration: 
      17 for the lower limb surgery; 7 for the upper limb surgery, 51 for the
      laparotomy/laparoscopic surgery of the abdominopelvic area, 13 studies regarding 
      breast surgery and 7 for cardiothoracic surgery. The analysis of these studies
      reveals that the technique has a variable effectiveness based on the type of
      structure involved: it is better in structures rich in subcutaneous and
      connective tissue, while the effectiveness is limited in anatomic districts with 
      a greater variability of innervation. However, regardless the heterogeneity of
      results, a general reduction in pain intensity and in opioid consumption has been
      observed with continuous wound infiltration: it is an excellent analgesic
      technique that can be included in the multimodal treatment of postoperative pain 
      or represents a valid alternative when other options are contraindicated.

LID - AE4530
AB  - The nutritional status of patients submitted to hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant is considered an independent risk factor, which may influence on
      quality of life and tolerance to the proposed treatment. The impairment of
      nutritional status during hematopoietic stem cell transplant occurs mainly due to
      the adverse effects resulting from conditioning to which the patient is
      subjected. Therefore, adequate nutritional evaluation and follow-up during
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant are essential. To emphasize the importance of 
      nutritional status and body composition during treatment, as well as the main
      characteristics related to the nutritional assessment of the patient, the
      Brazilian Consensus on Nutrition in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant: Adults
      was prepared, aiming to standardize and update Nutritional Therapy in this area. 
      Dietitians, nutrition physicians and hematologists from 15 Brazilian centers thar
      are references in hematopoietic stem cell transplant took part.

TI  - “My life is under control with these medications”: an interpretative
      phenomenological analysis of managing chronic pain with opioids.
LID - 61
AB  - Background: The use of opioids to relieve chronic pain has increased during the
      last decades, but experiences of chronic opioid therapy (COT) (> 90 days) point
      at risks and loss of beneficial effects. Still, some patients report benefits
      from opioid medication, such as being able to stay at work. Guidelines for opioid
      use in chronic pain do not consider the individual experience of COT, including
      benefits and risks, making the first person perspective an important scientific
      component to explore. The aim of this study was to investigate the lived
      experience of managing chronic pain with opioids in a sample who have severe
      chronic pain but are able to manage their pain sufficiently to remain at work.
      Methods: We used a qualitative research design: interpretative phenomenological
      analysis. Ten individuals with chronic pain and opioid therapy were purposively
      sampled in Swedish tertiary care. Results: Three super-ordinate themes emerged
      from the analyses: Without opioids, the pain becomes the boss; Opioids as a
      salvation and a curse, and Acknowledgement of the pain and acceptance of opioid
      therapy enables transition to a novel self. The participants used opioids to
      regain control over their pain, thus reclaiming their wanted life and self, and
      sense of control over one’s life-world. Using opioids to manage pain was not
      unproblematic and some of the participants had experienced a downward spiral of
      escalating pain and uncontrollable opioid use, and stigmatisation. Conclusions:
      All participants emphasised the importance of control, regarding both pain and
      opioid use. To accomplish this, trust between participants and health care
      providers was essential for satisfactory treatment. Regardless of the potential
      sociocultural benefits of staying at work, participants had experiences of
      balancing positive and negative effects of opioid therapy, similar to what
      previous qualitative research has found.Measurable improvement of function and
      quality of life, may justify the long-term use of opioids in some cases. However,
      monitoring of adverse events should be mandatory. This requires close cooperation
      and a trusting relationship between the patients and their health care provider.

TI  - Chronic pain diagnoses and opioid dispensings among insured individuals with
      serious mental illness.
LID - 40
AB  - Background: Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder
      (BD) have particularly high rates of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) and are also 
      more likely to receive prescription opioids for their pain. However, there have
      been no known studies published to date that have examined opioid treatment
      patterns among individuals with schizophrenia. Methods: Using electronic medical 
      record data across 13 Mental Health Research Network sites, individuals with
      diagnoses of MDD (N = 65,750), BD (N = 38,117) or schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder (N = 12,916) were identified and matched on age, sex and
      Medicare status to controls with no documented mental illness. CNCP diagnoses and
      prescription opioid medication dispensings were extracted for the matched
      samples. Multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate (1) the odds of
      receiving a pain-related diagnosis and (2) the odds of receiving opioids, by
      separate mental illness diagnosis category compared with matched controls,
      controlling for age, sex, Medicare status, race/ethnicity, income, medical
      comorbidities, healthcare utilization and chronic pain diagnoses. Results:
      Multivariable models indicated that having a MDD (OR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.85–1.95) 
      or BD (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.66–1.77) diagnosis was associated with increased
      odds of a CNCP diagnosis after controlling for age, sex, race, income, medical
      comorbidities and healthcare utilization. By contrast, having a schizophrenia
      diagnosis was associated with decreased odds of receiving a chronic pain
      diagnosis (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.82–0.90). Having a MDD (OR = 2.59; 95%
      CI = 2.44–2.75) or BD (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.97–2.28) diagnosis was associated
      with increased odds of receiving chronic opioid medications, even after
      controlling for age, sex, race, income, medical comorbidities, healthcare
      utilization and chronic pain diagnosis; having a schizophrenia diagnosis was not 
      associated with receiving chronic opioid medications. Conclusions: Individuals
      with serious mental illness, who are most at risk for developing opioid-related
      problems, continue to be prescribed opioids more often than their peers without
      mental illness. Mental health clinicians may be particularly well-suited to lead 
      pain assessment and management efforts for these patients. Future research is
      needed to evaluate the effectiveness of involving mental health clinicians in
      these efforts.

TI  - Prevention and management of diarrhea associated with naldemedine among patients 
      receiving opioids: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 25
AB  - Background: Naldemedine, a novel peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor
      antagonist, has improved opioid-induced constipation in randomized controlled
      trials. The most frequent adverse event of naldemedine is diarrhea, which can
      cause abdominal pain and often leads to treatment discontinuation. We aimed to
      identify risk factors and appropriate management strategies for key adverse
      events including diarrhea associated with naldemedine, since those have not been 
      extensively studied. Methods: We conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort
      study. Eligible patients had cancer, had undergone palliative care at
      participating centers, had been prescribed regular opioids, and had taken at
      least one dose of naldemedine between June 2017 and March 2018. The primary
      endpoint was the incidence of diarrhea according to baseline characteristics.
      Secondary endpoints included the duration of naldemedine administration, daily
      defecation counts before and after starting naldemedine, duration and severity of
      diarrhea as an adverse event of naldemedine, other adverse events, and the
      incidence of constipation within 7 days after recovery from diarrhea. We defined 
      patients who started naldemedine within three days of starting a regularly
      prescribed opioid as the early group, and the remainder as the late group.
      Results: Among 103 patients who received naldemedine, 98 fulfilled the
      eligibility criteria. The median age was 68 years and 48% of the patients were
      female. Median performance status was 3, and the median oral intake was 50%. The 
      median duration of naldemedine administration and overall survival were 25 and
      64 days, respectively. The incidence of diarrhea in the early group (n = 26) was 
      significantly lower than in the late group (n = 72) (3.9% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.02).
      Daily defecation counts increased after late (median 0.43 to 0.88, p < 0.001),
      but remained stable after early naldemedine administration (median 1.00 to 1.00, 
      p = 0.34). Constipation after the diarrhea was resolved was common (53%),
      especially among patients who stopped naldemedine (78%). The diarrhea was
      improved within three days in 92% of patients who stopped other laxatives.
      Conclusions: The early administration of naldemedine is beneficial because it
      reduces adverse events including diarrhea. Diarrhea caused by naldemedine can be 
      effectively managed by stopping other laxatives while continuing naldemedine.

      record-linkage study.
LID - 146
AB  - Background: Substance use disorders are a major risk factor for suicide. However,
      less is known about specific risk factors for suicide in people with substance
      use disorders. Methods: This population cohort study assessed suicide among
      people treated for drug use disorders in Denmark 2000–2010, and described risk
      factors for completed suicide. Data from 27,942 individuals enrolled in treatment
      were linked to national registers and matched with controls without drug use
      disorder and with (n = 138,136) or without psychiatric history (n = 1574).
      Competing risk regression was used to identify risk factors of completed suicide.
      Results: There were 163 suicides among patients with a history of drug treatment 
      (0.6% of patients). Increased risk was associated with younger age at enrolment
      (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 0.98), history of 
      psychiatric care (HR = 1.96, CI 95%: 1.39, 2.77), opioid use (HR = 1.81, 95% CI: 
      1.23, 2.68), and alcohol use (HR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.23). Lower risk was
      associated with cannabis use (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.96). Compared with age- 
      and gender-matched controls without a history of treatment for substance use
      disorders or recent psychiatric care, the standardized mortality ratio due to
      suicide was 7.13 for people with drug use disorder without a history of
      psychiatric care (95% CI: 5.81, 8.44), 13.48 for people with drug use disorder
      and psychiatric history (95% CI: 9.75, 17.22), and 13.61 for people with
      psychiatric history only (95% CI: 6.72, 20.50). Conclusions: Risk of suicide is
      increased among people with drug use disorders. Access to treatment for co-morbid
      mental health problems for people with drug use disorders could potentially
      reduce risk of suicide.

TI  - Correlations between opioid mortality increases related to illicit/synthetic
      opioids and reductions of medical opioid dispensing - exploratory analyses from
      Canada.
LID - 143
AB  - Background: North America has been experiencing a persistent epidemic of
      opioid-related overdose mortality, which has increasingly been driven by
      fatalities from illicit, toxic opioids in most recent years. Patterns of
      synthetic opioid availability and related mortality are heterogeneous across
      Canada, and differing explanations exist as to their differentiated
      proliferation. We examined the perspective that heterogeneous province-based
      variations in prescription opioid availability, facilitated by various control
      strategies, post-2010 may have created regionally differential supply gaps for
      non-medical opioid use substituted by synthetic opioid products with differential
      impacts on mortality risks and outcomes in Canada. Methods: We examined annual,
      prescription opioid dispensing rates and changes in the ten Canadian provinces
      (for the periods of 1) 2011–2018, 2) ‘peak-year’-to-2018) in Defined Daily
      Doses/1000 population/day, derived from data from a large representative,
      stratified sample of community pharmacies projected to a Canada total. Annual,
      provincial opioid-related mortality rates and changes for years 2016–2018 were
      calculated from federal data. We computed correlation values (Pearson’s R)
      between respective province-based change rates for prescription opioid dispensing
      and opioid-related mortality for the two over-time scenarios. Results: All but
      one province featured reductions in prescription opioid dispensing 2011–2018;
      seven of the ten provinces had increases in opioid mortality 2016–2018. The
      correlation between changes in opioid dispensing (2011–2018) and in
      opioid-mortality (2016–2018) was r = 0.63 (df = 8, p-value: 0.05); the
      correlation was r = 0.57 (df = 8, p-value: 0.09) for changes in opioid dispensing
      ‘peak year’-to-2018, respectively. Conclusions: Quasi-significant results
      indicate that recent increases in opioid-related deaths driven by illicit,
      synthetic opioids tended to be larger in provinces where reductions in
      prescription opioid availability have been more extensive. It is a plausible
      explanation that these reductions created supply gaps for non-medical opioid use 
      increasingly filled by illicit, synthetic opioids differentially contributing to 
      opioid-related deaths, generating un-intended adverse effects for previous
      interventions. General prevention measures to reduce opioid availability, and
      targeted prevention for at-risk opioid users exposed to toxic drug supply may be 
      include counteractive effects and require coordinated reconciliation.

TI  - Stratified analyses of genome wide association study data reveal haplotypes for a
      candidate gene on chromosome 2 (KIAA1211L) is associated with opioid use in
      patients of Arabian descent.
LID - 41
AB  - Background: Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been conducted to
      identify genes and pathways involved in development of opioid use disorder. This 
      study extends the first GWAS of substance use disorder (SUD) patients from the
      United Arab Emirates (UAE) by stratifying the study group based on opioid use,
      which is the most common substance of use in this cohort. Methods: The GWAS
      cohort consisted of 512 (262 case, 250 controls) male participants from the UAE. 
      The samples were genotyped using the Illumina Omni5 Exome system. Data was
      stratified according to opioid use using PLINK. Haplotype analysis was conducted 
      using Haploview 4.2. Results: Two main associations were identified in this
      study. Firstly, two SNPs on chromosome 7 were associated with opioid use
      disorder, rs118129027 (p-value = 1.23 × 10 − 8) and rs74477937
      (p-value = 1.48 × 10 − 8). This has been reported in Alblooshi et al. (Am J Med
      Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet 180(1):68–79, 2019). Secondly, haplotypes on
      chromosome 2 which mapped to the KIAA1211L locus were identified in association
      with opioid use. Five SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (rs2280142,
      rs6542837, rs12712037, rs10175560, rs11900524) were arranged into haplotypes. Two
      haplotypes GAGCG and AGTTA were associated with opioid use disorders (p-value
      3.26 × 10− 8 and 7.16 × 10− 7, respectively). Conclusion: This is the first GWAS 
      to identify candidate genes associated with opioid use disorder in participants
      from the UAE. The lack of other genetic data of Arabian descent opioid use
      patients has hindered replication of the findings. Nevertheless, the outcomes
      implicate new pathways in opioid use disorder that requires further research to
      assess the role of the identified genes in the development of opioid use
      disorder.

TI  - Does early palliative identification improve the use of palliative care services?
LID - e0226597
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate whether the early identification of patients who may benefit
      from palliative care impacts on the use of palliative, community and acute-based 
      care services. Methods: Between 2014 and 2017, physicians from eight sites were
      encouraged to systematically identify patients who were likely to die within one 
      year and would were thought to benefit from early palliative care. Patients in
      the INTEGRATE Intervention Group were 1:1 matched to controls selected from
      provincial healthcare administrative data using propensity score-matching. The
      use of palliative care, community-based care services (home care, physician home 
      visit, and outpatient opioid use) and acute care (emergency department,
      hospitalization) was each evaluated within one year after the date of
      identification. The hazard ratio (HR) in the Intervention Group was calculated
      for each outcome. Results: Of the 1,185 patients in the Intervention Group, 951
      (80.3%) used palliative care services during follow-up, compared to 739 (62.4%)
      among 1,185 patients in the Control Group [HR of 1.69 (95% CI 1.56 to 1.82)]. The
      Intervention Group also had higher proportions of patients who used home care
      [81.4% vs. 55.2%; HR 2.07 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.27)], had physician home visits
      [35.5% vs. 23.7%; HR 1.63 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.92)] or had increased outpatient
      opioid use [64.3% vs. 52.1%); HR 1.43 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.57]. The Intervention
      Group was also more likely to have a hospitalization that was not primarily
      focused on palliative care (1.42 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.58)) and an unplanned
      emergency department visit for non-palliative care purpose (1.47 (95% CI 1.32 to 
      1.64)). Conclusion: Physicians actively identifying patients who would benefit
      from palliative care resulted in increased use of palliative and community-based 
      care services, but also increased use of acute care services.

TI  - The National Ambulance Surveillance System: A novel method for monitoring acute
      alcohol, illicit and pharmaceutical drug related-harms using coded Australian
      ambulance clinical records.
LID - e0228316
AB  - Although harmful consumption of alcohol and other drugs (both illicit and
      pharmaceutical) significantly contribute to global burden of disease, not all
      harms are captured within existing morbidity data sources. Indeed, harms
      occurring in the community may be missed or under-reported. This paper describes 
      the National Ambulance Surveillance System, a unique Australian system for
      monitoring and mapping acute harms related to alcohol and other drug consumption.
      Data are sourced from paramedic electronic patient care records provided by
      ambulance services from across Australia. Coding occurs in a purpose-built
      system, by a team of specialised research assistants. Alcohol, and specific
      illicit and pharmaceutical drugs, rather than broad drug classes, are manually
      coded and the dataset is reviewed and cleaned prior to analysis. The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an ongoing, dynamic surveillance system of
      alcohol and other drug-related harms across Australia. The data includes more
      than 140 output variables per attendance, including individual substances,
      demographics, temporal, geospatial, and clinical data (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale
      score, naloxone provision and response, outcome of attendance). The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an internationally unique population-level
      surveillance system of acute harms arising from alcohol and other drug
      consumption. Dissemination of National Ambulance Surveillance System data has
      been used to inform and evaluate policy approaches and potential points of
      intervention, as well as guide workforce development needs and clinical practice 
      at the local and national level. This methodology could be replicated in other
      countries.

TI  - Adapting a peer recovery coach-delivered behavioral activation intervention for
      problematic substance use in a medically underserved community in Baltimore City.
LID - e0228084
AB  - Low-income, racial/ethnic minority groups have disproportionately high rates of
      problematic substance use yet face barriers in accessing evidence-based
      interventions (EBIs). Peer recovery coaches (PRCs), individuals with lived
      experience with problematic substance use, may provide an effective approach to
      reaching these individuals. Traditionally PRCs have focused on bridging to other 
      types of care rather than delivering EBIs themselves. The aim of this study was
      to assess perceptions of the appropriateness of a PRC-delivered adapted
      behavioral activation (BA) intervention to reduce problematic substance use for
      individuals not engaged in care. This study was conducted at a community resource
      center in Baltimore, Maryland serving low-income and homeless clients who have
      high rates of problematic substance use yet also face barriers to accessing care.
      Guided by the ADAPT-ITT framework, we conducted semi-structured key informant
      interviews with clients (n = 30) with past or present problematic substance use, 
      and a focus group with community providers, including staff at the community
      resource center (n = 5) and PRCs (n = 6) from the community. Thirty percent (n = 
      9) of clients interviewed reported past problematic substance use and 70% (n =
      21) met criteria for current use, most commonly cocaine and opioids. Clients,
      center staff, and PRCs shared that PRC-delivered BA could be acceptable and
      appropriate with suggested adaptations, including adding peer-delivered
      case-management and linkage to care alongside BA, and tailoring BA to include
      activities that are accessible and feasible in the community. These findings will
      inform the adaptation of PRC-delivered BA to address problematic substance use in
      this setting.

TI  - Phase II/III Study of Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate in Japanese Pediatric Patients 
      with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.
PG  - 21-31
AB  - Objective: To further define the efficacy and safety profiles of lisdexamfetamine
      dimesylate (LDX) in Japanese pediatric patients with
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Methods: This was a multicenter, 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of LDX 30, 50, or 70 mg/day
      for 4 weeks in 76 patients 6–17 years of age with ADHD in Japan. The primary
      efficacy endpoint was the change in the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total
      score from baseline to 4 weeks. Secondary efficacy endpoints were: Conners' Third
      Edition (Japanese version) Parent Rating Scale (Conners 3), Clinical Global
      Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale, and Parent Global Assessment (PGA)
      scale.Results: Change in the ADHD-RS-IV total score from baseline to 4 weeks was 
      significantly greater (p < 0.0001) in all LDX dosage groups versus placebo
      (30 mg, −16.38; 50 mg, −18.10; 70 mg, −16.47; placebo, −2.78). At all time
      points, improvements (decreases) in the ADHD-RS-IV total score were significantly
      greater in all LDX groups versus placebo. At weeks 3 and 4, improvements from
      baseline in Conners 3 inattention plus hyperactivity/impulsivity subscale scores 
      were significantly greater (p ≤ 0.0082) for all LDX dosages versus placebo. At
      week 4, the proportion of LDX-treated patients “much improved” or “very much
      improved” was 61%–71% on the CGI-I scale (p ≤ 0.0019) and 56%–65% on the PGA
      scale (p ≤ 0.0170). LDX was generally well tolerated. The most frequent
      treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were decreased appetite, headache, and
      initial insomnia. No severe/serious AEs occurred, and no AEs specific to Japanese
      patients were evident.Conclusions: The superiority of LDX 30, 50, and 70 mg/day
      over placebo was confirmed in Japanese pediatric patients with ADHD, and no major
      safety or tolerability concerns were identified.

TI  - Sex- and Gender-Based Analysis in Cannabis Treatment Outcomes: A Systematic
      Review.
LID - 872
AB  - There is evidence that sex- and gender-related factors are involved in cannabis
      patterns of use, health effects and biological mechanisms. Women and men report
      different cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptoms, with women reporting worse
      withdrawal symptoms than men. The objective of this systematic review was to
      examine the effectiveness of cannabis pharmacological interventions for women and
      men and the uptake of sex- and gender-based analysis in the included studies. Two
      reviewers performed the full-paper screening, and data was extracted by one
      researcher. The search yielded 6098 unique records—of which, 68 were full-paper
      screened. Four articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. From the
      randomized clinical studies of pharmacological interventions, few studies report 
      sex-disaggregated outcomes for women and men. Despite emergent evidence showing
      the influence of sex and gender factors in cannabis research, sex-disaggregated
      outcomes in pharmacological interventions is lacking. Sex- and gender-based
      analysis is incipient in the included articles. Future research should explore
      more comprehensive inclusion of sex- and gender-related aspects in
      pharmacological treatments for CUD.

TI  - Desmetramadol Is Identified as a G-Protein Biased µ Opioid Receptor Agonist.
LID - 1680
AB  - Tramadol is widely used globally and is the second most prescribed opioid in the 
      United States. It treats moderate to severe pain but lethal opioid-induced
      respiratory depression is uncommon even in large overdose. It is unknown why
      tramadol spares respiration. Here we show its active metabolite, desmetramadol,
      is as effective as morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl in eliciting G protein
      coupling at the human µ opioid receptor (MOR), but surprisingly, supratherapeutic
      concentrations spare human MOR-mediated βarrestin2 recruitment thought to mediate
      lethal opioid-induced respiratory depression.

TI  - Role of Oxycodone Hydrochloride in Treating Radiotherapy-Related Pain.
LID - 7565962
AB  - Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat cancer patients. Besides the curable
      effect, radiotherapy also could relieve the pain of cancer patients. However,
      cancer pain is gradually alleviated about two weeks after radiotherapy. In
      addition, cancer patients who receive radiotherapy may also suffer from pain
      flare or radiotherapy-induced side effects such as radiation esophagitis,
      enteritis, and mucositis. Pain control is reported to be inadequate during the
      whole course of radiotherapy (before, during, and after radiotherapy), and
      quality of life is seriously affected. Hence, radiotherapy is suggested to be
      combined with analgesic drugs in clinical guidelines. Previous studies have shown
      that radiotherapy combined with oxycodone hydrochloride can effectively alleviate
      cancer pain. In this review, we firstly presented the necessity of analgesia
      during the whole course of radiotherapy. We also sketched the role of oxycodone
      hydrochloride in radiotherapy of bone metastases and radiotherapy-induced oral
      mucositis. Finally, we concluded that oxycodone hydrochloride shows good efficacy
      and tolerance and could be used for pain management before, during, and after
      radiotherapy.

TI  - Propoxyphene Mediates Oxyhemoglobin-Induced Injury in Rat Cortical Neurons
      Through Up-Regulation of Active-β-Catenin.
LID - 1616
AB  - Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in various biological processes, including
      the development of the central nervous system. The dysfunction of mitochondria
      has been shown to participate in the progress of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
      Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH) is a serious complication in acute
      craniocerebral trauma. Opioids can activate the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling
      pathway. c-Myc, a downstream protein of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, contributes to
      the fusion of mitochondria. Here, we investigated the protective roles of
      Propoxyphene (Pro) against Oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb)-induced primary cultured neuron 
      apoptosis. The data indicated that Pro rescued active-β-catenin from
      OxyHb-induced decline. Furthermore, Pro attenuated OxyHb-induced apoptosis and
      fission of mitochondria in primary cortical neurons. However, the protective
      effects were abrogated under active-β-catenin-deficient conditions. Together, the
      data presented here showed that Pro, a weak opioid analgesic drug, attenuates
      OxyHb-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in an
      active-β-catenin-c-Myc-dependent manner.

TI  - Cannabis and Cannabinoids in the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases.
LID - e0007
AB  - Chronic pain is a common complaint among patients, and rheumatic diseases are a
      common cause for chronic pain. Current pharmacological interventions for chronic 
      pain are not always useful or safe enough for long-term use. Cannabis and
      cannabinoids are currently being studied due to their potential as analgesics. In
      this review we will discuss current literature regarding cannabinoids and
      cannabis as treatment for rheumatic diseases. Fibromyalgia is a prevalent
      rheumatic disease that causes diffuse pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.
      Treatment of this syndrome is symptomatic, and it has been suggested that
      cannabis and cannabinoids could potentially alleviate some of the symptoms
      associated with fibromyalgia. In this review we cite some of the evidence that
      supports this claim. However, data on long-term efficacy and safety of
      cannabinoid and cannabis use are still lacking. Cannabinoids and cannabis are
      commonly investigated as analgesic agents, but in recent years more evidence has 
      accumulated on their potential immune-modulatory effect, supported by results in 
      animal models of certain rheumatic diseases. While results that demonstrate the
      same effect in humans are still lacking, cannabinoids and cannabis remain
      potential drugs to alleviate the pain associated with rheumatic diseases, as they
      were shown to be safe and to cause limited adverse effects.

TI  - Cannabis and Pain Treatment—A Review of the Clinical Utility and a Practical
      Approach in Light of Uncertainty.
LID - e0002
AB  - Over the past decade the phenomenon of cannabis as a legitimate form of treatment
      for pain has overwhelmed the medical community, especially in the field of pain. 
      From a status of a schedule 1 substance having no currently accepted medical use 
      and being considered to have high potential for abuse, its use has mushroomed to 
      over 50,000 legal medical users per year in Israel alone. There appear to be many
      reasons behind this phenomenon—medical, sociological, and economical. Thus, what 
      is cannabis? An abusive substance or a medication? Should it be incorporated into
      current biomedical practice, and how should it be administered? Finally, what is 
      the evidence for the beneficial and detrimental effects of cannabis? This article
      reviews and discusses the current literature regarding the beneficial and the
      detrimental effects of medical cannabis in the treatment of pain. We further
      discuss the problems and challenges facing the medical community in this domain
      and offer a practical approach to deal with these challenges.

TI  - Spinal versus General Anesthesia for Patients with Parkinson’s Disease.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - Background: Anesthesiologists prefer using general anesthesia (GA) in Parkinson’s
      disease (PD). However, GA may mask neurological symptoms in the intraoperative
      period and exacerbate them postoperatively. Furthermore, the anesthetics used in 
      GA have clear interactions with the drugs used to control PD. On the other hand, 
      drugs used in spinal anesthesia (SA) might be safer for patients with PD. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the effect of SA and GA in patients with PD who
      underwent hip fracture repairs. Methods: Retrospectively, we identified those
      patients with PD who were admitted due to hip joint fracture. The following
      information were obtained: demographics, preoperative assessment information of
      the patients, type of anesthesia, and types of fractures and orthopedic
      procedures. In addition, intraoperative and postoperative complications were
      studied. The patients were divided based on the type of anesthesia received and
      were compared. Results: Ten (8 males) patients with PD who underwent hip fracture
      surgery included in the study. Six patients received SA and 4 patients received
      GA. The mean age was 73.2 years. The preoperative assessment was not significant 
      for all patients. Postoperatively, within the inpatient period, 3 out of 4
      patients received GA developed complications (two atelectasis and urinary tract
      infection) while no patient developed complication from the SA group.
      Postoperative outpatient complications within one-month included 3 out of 4 cases
      in the GA group and only one complication in the SA group. The mean
      hospitalization period was 9 days for patients received GA and 5.8 days for
      patients received SA. Conclusion: This study reported less perioperative
      complications in the SA. Accordingly, further investigations and rp-randomized
      controlled trials evaluating various anesthetic techniques or drugs are needed.

TI  - Teriparatide in East Asian Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis in a Real-World
      Setting: A Baseline Analysis of the Asia and Latin America Fracture Observational
      Study (ALAFOS).
PG  - 111-21
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this analysis is to describe the baseline characteristics of 
      patients who are prescribed teriparatide for the treatment of postmenopausal
      osteoporosis in a real-world setting in East Asia. Patients and Methods: The Asia
      and Latin America Fracture Observational Study (ALAFOS) is a prospective,
      multinational, observational study designed to evaluate real-world use of
      teriparatide in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 20 countries
      across Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia. This subregional
      analysis focuses on the East Asian subpopulation of the ALAFOS study. Here we
      report baseline clinical characteristics, details regarding the history of
      fractures, risk factors for osteoporosis, comorbidities, osteoporosis treatment, 
      and health-related quality of life in patients enrolled in China, Hong Kong,
      South Korea, and Taiwan. Results: The East Asian subgroup of ALAFOS included 1136
      postmenopausal women, constituting 37.5% (1136/3031) of the overall ALAFOS
      patient population. The mean (SD) age was 75.0 (9.6) years. The mean (SD) bone
      mineral density T-scores were −3.11 (1.54), −2.58 (1.11), and −2.86 (1.09) at the
      lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, respectively; 69.6% of patients had
      experienced at least one fragility fracture and 40.4% had experienced ≥2
      fragility fractures after 40 years of age. Overall, 63.3% of patients had used
      medications for osteoporosis in the past. The mean (SD) EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS) score at baseline was 59.7 (20.8); the mean (SD) back pain numeric
      rating scale score for worst pain in the last 24 hrs was 5.2 (3.2). Conclusion:
      Our results indicate that patients who are prescribed teriparatide in East Asia
      were elderly women with severe osteoporosis, low bone mineral density, high
      prevalence of fractures, back pain and poor health-related quality of life. Most 
      of the patients received teriparatide as a second-line treatment.

TI  - Impact of a low FODMAP diet on the amount of rectal gas and rectal volume during 
      radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer – a prospective pilot study.
LID - 27
AB  - Background: Small inter- and intrafractional prostate motion was shown to be a
      prerequisite for precise radiotherapy (RT) of prostate cancer (PCa) to achieve
      good local control and low rectal toxicity. As rectal gas and rectal volume are
      known to have a relevant effect on prostate motion, this study aims to reduce
      these parameters by using a Low FODMAP Diet (LFD) and to show feasibility of this
      intervention. Methods: We compared a prospective intervention group (IG, n = 25) 
      which underwent RT for PCa and whose patients were asked to follow a LFD during
      RT with a retrospective control group (CG, n = 25) which did not get any dietary 
      advice. In the planning CT scan and all available cone beam CT scans rectal gas
      was classified based on a semiquantitative score (scale from 1 to 5) and rectal
      volume was measured. Furthermore, patients’ compliance was evaluated by a
      self-assessment questionnaire. Results: Clinical and treatment characteristics
      were well balanced between both groups. A total of 266 (CG, 10.6 per patient) and
      280 CT scans (IG, 11.2 per patient), respectively, were analysed. The frequency
      distribution of gas scores differed significantly from each other (p < .001) with
      the IG having lower scores. Rectal volume was smaller in the IG (64.28 cm3, 95%
      CI 60.92–67.65 cm3, SD 28.64 cm3) than in the CG (71.40 cm3, 95% CI
      66.47–76.32 cm3, SD 40.80 cm3) (p = .02). Mean intrapatient standard deviation as
      a measure for the variability of rectal volume was 22 cm3 in the IG and 23 cm3 in
      the CG (p = .81). Patients’ compliance and contentment were satisfying.
      Conclusions: The use of a LFD significantly decreased rectal gas and rectal
      volume. LFD was feasible with an excellent patients’ compliance. However,
      prospective trials with a larger number of patients and a standardized evaluation
      of gastrointestinal toxicity and quality of life are reasonable. Trial

TI  - Health-related quality of life in adolescents with persistent pain and the
      mediating role of self-efficacy: a cross-sectional study.
LID - 19
AB  - Background: Persistent pain has a high prevalence among adolescents. Pain has
      been shown to reduce all aspects of the adolescent’s health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL). In adult patients with pain, self-efficacy has been shown to
      mediate the relationship between pain intensity, disability and depression.
      However, little is known about whether self-efficacy acts as a mediating variable
      in the relationship between persistent pain and HRQOL sub-scale scores in a
      school-based population of adolescents. Objectives: To describe the experience of
      pain, HRQOL and self-efficacy, and to explore the association between pain
      intensity, general self-efficacy and HRQOL in adolescents with persistent pain by
      testing self-efficacy as a possible mediator. Methods: The study participants
      were 78 adolescents with persistent pain, aged 16–19 years, who were recruited
      from five high schools in southern Norway. All participants completed an
      electronic survey consisting of the Lubeck Pain Questionnaire, which included a
      visual analogue scale (VAS) measuring pain intensity, the General Self-Efficacy
      Scale (GSE) and the KIDSCREEN-52 Questionnaire measuring HRQOL. Statistical
      analyses were conducted using the PROCESS macro for SPSS developed by Andrew
      Hayes. Results: All participants reported pain in multiple locations, of which
      the head was most common (88.5%). Mean (SD) pain intensity score of the
      participants was 5.4 (1.8). The study sample had poor HRQOL, with mean (SD)
      scores for several sub-scales ranging from 45.2 (21.0) to 91.0 (13.3) on a 0–100 
      scale. The associations between pain intensity and the HRQOL sub-scales of
      physical well-being, psychological well-being, mood, self-perception, autonomy
      and school environment were mediated by self-efficacy. The highest degree of
      mediation and, thus, the largest indirect effect was estimated for the HRQOL
      sub-scale physical well-being (67.2%). Conclusions: This school-based sample of
      adolescents with persistent pain had impaired HRQOL. Up to 67% of the reduction
      in the HRQOL sub-scale scores for physical well-being, psychological well-being, 
      mood, self-perception, autonomy and school environment could be explained by the 
      mediating variable self-efficacy. Thus, future pain-management interventions that
      aim to increase HRQOL in school-based populations of adolescents with persistent 
      pain should consider promoting self-efficacy and providing more targeted
      interventions. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03551977.

TI  - Randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-centre study to assess the
      efficacy, tolerability and safety of Enterosgel® in the treatment of irritable
      bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) in adults.
LID - 122
AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a common and
      chronic condition that can significantly impair quality of life. The emergence of
      new drugs for IBS-D has been slow and there is a need for new treatments,
      including drug-free treatments, which are easy to use and suitable for different 
      patient groups. Currently available drug-free treatments include Enterosgel®, an 
      intestinal adsorbent approved for use in IBS-D and acute diarrhoea and available 
      over-the-counter in the UK and 30 countries worldwide. The aim of this
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study is to test the
      efficacy and safety of Enterosgel® compared to placebo in symptomatic treatment
      in IBS-D. Methods/design: We will recruit 430 participants with IBS-D from
      approximately 30 primary and secondary care sites in England. Participants
      meeting the required abdominal pain and stool consistency criteria over a 2-week 
      screening period will be randomly allocated to receive blinded treatment
      (Enterosgel® or placebo) for 8 weeks. This will be followed by an 8-week
      open-label treatment phase with Enterosgel®. Participants will be allowed to
      adjust their daily dosage during both phases based on their symptoms.
      Participants will then return to standard care and those who responded to
      treatment will receive a follow-up call 8 weeks later. Co-medication with
      loperamide will be permitted and use recorded. The primary outcome measure is the
      percentage of participants defined as responders for abdominal pain and stool
      consistency during at least 4 weeks in the 8-week blinded phase. Secondary
      outcome measures include stool frequency, stool consistency, abdominal pain,
      bloating, urgency, adequate relief, questionnaire scores and rescue medication
      use. Exploratory outcomes will be assessed in subsets of participants including
      qualitative and quantitative data on faecal microorganisms and biomarkers and
      gut-related measurements from magnetic resonance imaging data. Discussion: This
      is the first large scale randomised controlled trial investigating Enterosgel® in
      IBS-D. A study design with blinded phase followed by an open-label phase was
      chosen to encourage participation and study completion. Demonstrating that
      Enterosgel® is effective and safe in IBS-D could encourage adoption by patients
      and healthcare professionals and foster future clinical trials assessing its use 
      in related conditions. Trial registration: ISRCTN17149988. Prospectively

TI  - Multi-region assessment of pharmaceutical exposures and predicted effects in USA 
      wadeable urban-gradient streams.
LID - e0228214
AB  - Human-use pharmaceuticals in urban streams link aquatic-ecosystem health to human
      health. Pharmaceutical mixtures have been widely reported in larger streams due
      to historical emphasis on wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) sources, with limited
      investigation of pharmaceutical exposures and potential effects in smaller
      headwater streams. In 2014–2017, the United States Geological Survey measured 111
      pharmaceutical compounds in 308 headwater streams (261 urban-gradient sites
      sampled 3–5 times, 47 putative low-impact sites sampled once) in 4 regions across
      the US. Simultaneous exposures to multiple pharmaceutical compounds
      (pharmaceutical mixtures) were observed in 91% of streams (248 urban-gradient, 32
      low-impact), with 88 analytes detected across all sites and cumulative maximum
      concentrations up to 36,142 ng/L per site. Cumulative detections and
      concentrations correlated to urban land use and presence/absence of permitted
      WWTP discharges, but pharmaceutical mixtures also were common in the 75% of
      sampled streams without WWTP. Cumulative exposure-activity ratios (EAR) indicated
      widespread transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to
      vertebrates. Considering the potential individual and interactive effects of the 
      detected pharmaceuticals and the recognized analytical underestimation of the
      pharmaceutical-contaminant (unassessed parent compounds, metabolites, degradates)
      space, these results demonstrate a nation-wide environmental concern and the need
      for watershed-scale mitigation of in-stream pharmaceutical contamination.

TI  - Job postings in the substance use disorder treatment related sector during the
      first five years of Medicaid expansion.
LID - e0228394
AB  - Background: Effective treatment strategies exist for substance use disorder
      (SUD), however severe hurdles remain in ensuring adequacy of the SUD treatment
      (SUDT) workforce as well as improving SUDT affordability, access and stigma.
      Although evidence shows recent increases in SUD medication access from expanding 
      Medicaid availability under the Affordable Care Act, it is yet unknown whether
      these policies also led to a growth in hiring in the SUDT related workforce,
      partly due to poor data availability. Our study uses novel data to shed light on 
      recent trends in a fast-evolving and policy-relevant labor market, and
      contributes to understanding data sources to track the SUDT related workforce and
      the effect of recent state healthcare policies on the supply side of this sector.
      Methods and data: We examine hiring attempts in the SUDT and related behavioral
      health sector over 2010-2018 to estimate the causal effect of the 2014-and-beyond
      state Medicaid expansions on these outcomes through “difference-in-difference”
      econometric models. We use Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) data covering
      virtually all U.S. job postings by employers. Findings: Nationally, we find
      little growth in the sector’s hiring attempts in 2010-2018 relative to the rest
      of the economy or to health care as a whole. However, this masks heterogeneity in
      the bimodal trend in SUDT job postings, with some increases in most years but a
      decrease in 2014 and in 2017, as well as a shift in emphasis between different
      occupational categories. Medicaid expansion, however, is not associated with any 
      statistically significant change in overall hiring attempts in the SUDT related
      sector during this time period, although there is moderate evidence of increases 
      among primary care physicians. Conclusions: Although hiring attempts in the SUDT 
      related sector as measured by the number of job advertisements have not grown
      substantially over time, there was a shift in the hiring landscape. Many national
      factors including reimbursement policy may play a role in incentivizing demand
      for the SUDT related workforce, but our research does not show that recent state 
      Medicaid expansion was one such statistically detectable factor. Future research 
      is needed to understand how aggregate labor demand signals translate into actual 
      increases in SUDT workforce and availability.

TI  - Risk factors for liposomal bupivacaine resistance after total hip or knee
      arthroplasties: a retrospective observational cohort in 237 patients.
LID - 6
AB  - Purpose: Liposomal bupivacaine demonstrated promise decreasing postoperative pain
      in total hip and total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA). Some randomized trials have
      shown non-superior results; however, confounding variables were not accounted for
      in such analyses. This study attempts to determine risk factors associated with
      failure of pain management in patients receiving liposomal bupivacaine. Methods: 
      Postoperative pain scores were collected following primary or revision
      arthroplasties between January 2016 and December 2017. Retrospective analysis of 
      institutional total joint quality and outcomes registry was screened and patients
      undergoing primary or revision arthroplasties who completed a multi-modal pain
      management including liposomal bupivacaine were included in the study. Patients
      with a history of infection/deviated from the institutional pain management
      protocol were excluded. Results: A total of 237 patients were included for
      analysis. Younger patients less than 64 years old had significantly higher pain
      scores between 0 and 12 h and > 24 h. Active smokers had significantly higher
      pain scores between 0 and 6 h and > 24 h. Patients with a history of opioid
      use/pain management had significantly higher pain scores at 6-12 h and 24-48 h.
      Regression analysis indicated risk factors for resistance to liposomal
      bupivacaine are younger patients less than 64 years old, those undergoing primary
      THA, and patients with a history of smoking/pain management/opioid use.
      Conclusion: We identify risk factors for resistance to liposomal bupivacaine,
      which include younger age less than 64 years old, history of smoking/pain
      management/opioid use. Future studies should use these risk factors as exclusion 
      criteria when using liposomal bupivacaine or initiating any randomized trials
      regarding efficacy.

TI  - Nonunion – consensus from the 4th annual meeting of the Danish Orthopaedic Trauma
      Society.
PG  - 46-57
AB  - Nonunions are a relevant economic burden affecting about 1.9% of all fractures.
      Rather than specifying a certain time frame, a nonunion is better defined as a
      fracture that will not heal without further intervention.Successful fracture
      healing depends on local biology, biomechanics and a variety of systemic factors.
      All components can principally be decisive and determine the classification of
      atrophic, oligotrophic or hypertrophic nonunions. Treatment prioritizes mechanics
      before biology.The degree of motion between fracture parts is the key for healing
      and is described by strain theory. If the change of length at a given load is >
      10%, fibrous tissue and not bone is formed. Therefore, simple fractures require
      absolute and complex fractures relative stability.The main characteristics of a
      nonunion are pain while weight bearing, and persistent fracture lines on
      X-ray.Treatment concepts such as ‘mechanobiology’ or the ‘diamond concept’
      determine the applied osteosynthesis considering soft tissue, local biology and
      stability. Fine wire circular external fixation is considered the only form of
      true biologic fixation due to its ability to eliminate parasitic motions while
      maintaining load-dependent axial stiffness. Nailing provides intramedullary
      stability and biology via reaming. Plates are successful when complex fractures
      turn into simple nonunions demanding absolute stability. Despite available
      alternatives, autograft is the gold standard for providing osteoinductive and
      osteoconductive stimuli.The infected nonunion remains a challenge. Bacteria,
      especially staphylococcus species, have developed mechanisms to survive such as
      biofilm formation, inactive forms and internalization. Therefore, radical
      debridement and specific antibiotics are necessary prior to reconstruction.Cite

TI  - Electroacupuncture Treatment Attenuates Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathic Pain in
      Rats via Inhibiting Spinal Glia and the TLR4/NF-κB Pathway.
PG  - 239-50
AB  - Background and Purpose: Neuropathic pain is a major side-effect of paclitaxel
      (PTX) chemotherapy. Although the precise mechanisms responsible for this pain are
      unclear, the activation of neuroglia and upregulation of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway
      are known to be involved. In this study, we determined whether electroacupuncture
      (EA) could limit mechanical hypersensitivity resulting from the chemotherapeutic 
      drug PTX in rats, and investigated the potential mechanisms involved. Methods:
      Rats intraperitoneally received a cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg PTX (2 mg/kg per
      day) or vehicle control on alternate days (day 0, 2, 4 and 6). EA treatment (10
      Hz, 1 mA) was applied at bilateral ST36 acupoints in rats once every other day on
      days 0–14. For sham EA, needles were inserted at ST36 acupoints without
      electrical stimulation. Mechanical allodynia was measured by mechanical
      withdrawal latency (MWL) of paws to a mechanical stimulus every 2 days. Protein
      expression of TLR4 and NF-κB p65, as well as TMEM119 and GFAP (indicators of
      microglia and astrocytes, respectively) in spinal cord was quantified by Western 
      blot analysis. Levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in spinal cord
      and serum were detected by ELISA. Results: Mechanical allodynia induced by PTX in
      both paws (right and left) of rats was significantly attenuated by EA but not
      sham EA treatment. In addition, EA, but not sham EA, inhibited the activation of 
      both microglia (TMEM119) and astrocytes (GFAP) in lumbar spinal cord. Moreover,
      Western blot analysis revealed that protein expression of TLR4 and NF-κB in
      spinal cord was suppressed by EA but not sham EA treatment. PTX significantly
      increased inflammatory cytokines in spinal cord and serum, which were ameliorated
      by EA treatment but not by sham EA. Conclusion: These results indicate that EA
      treatment attenuates PTX-induced mechanical allodynia. The putative mechanism
      corroborating this finding could be related to the suppression of activated
      microglia and astrocytes in spinal cord, as well as the inhibition of the
      activated TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway by EA treatment.

TI  - Fetal and Maternal Responses to Dexmedetomidine Intrathecal Application During
      Cesarean Section: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e918523-1-e918523-13
AB  - Background: Intrathecal dexmedetomidine (DEX) can improve the blockade of spinal 
      anesthesia, but there is no clear conclusion on whether it has an effect on the
      fetus during cesarean section. Our meta-analysis evaluated the safety and
      efficacy of intrathecal DEX in cesarean delivery. Material/Methods: We searched
      Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and CBM for eligible studies, and used the Revised
      Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2.0) to assess the risk of bias of each study.
      RevMan was used for statistical analyses. We have registered this meta-analysis
      on PROSPERO (CRD42019120995). Results: The meta-analysis included 10 RCTs, but
      only 5 were prospectively registered. The results of preregistration studies,
      including the 1- or 5-min Apgar score (mean difference [MD], −0.03; 95%
      confidence intervals [CI], −0.16 to 0.10; P=0.64 or MD, 0.00; 95% CI, −0.09 to
      0.09; P=1), the umbilical arterial oxygen or carbon dioxide partial pressure (MD,
      0.90; 95% CI, −4.92 to 6.72; P=0.76 or MD, 1.20; 95% CI, −2.06 to 4.46; P=0.47), 
      and the cord blood pH (MD, −0.01; 95% CI, −0.05 to 0.03; P=0.72), showed that
      intrathecal DEX had no significant difference in neonatal outcomes compared with 
      placebo. In maternal outcomes, intrathecal DEX significantly prolonged
      postoperative pain-free period and reduced the incidence of postoperative
      shivering, which did not increase spinal anesthesia-associated adverse effects.
      Conclusions: Intrathecal DEX is safe for the fetus during cesarean section and
      can improve the blockade effects of spinal anesthesia on puerperae.

TI  - Epigenetics and In Utero Acquired Predisposition to Metabolic Disease.
LID - 1270
AB  - Epidemiological evidence has shown an association between prenatal malnutrition
      and a higher risk of developing metabolic disease in adult life. An inadequate
      intrauterine milieu affects both growth and development, leading to a permanent
      programming of endocrine and metabolic functions. Programming may be due to the
      epigenetic modification of genes implicated in the regulation of key metabolic
      mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs
      (miRNAs). The expression of miRNAs in organs that play a key role in metabolism
      is influenced by in utero programming, as demonstrated by both experimental and
      human studies. miRNAs modulate multiple pathways such as insulin signaling,
      immune responses, adipokine function, lipid metabolism, and food intake. Liver is
      one of the main target organs of programming, undergoing structural, functional, 
      and epigenetic changes following the exposure to a suboptimal intrauterine
      environment. The focus of this review is to provide an overview of the effects of
      exposure to an adverse in utero milieu on epigenome with a focus on the molecular
      mechanisms involved in liver programming.

TI  - Opioid and Polydrug Use Among Patients in Opioid Maintenance Treatment.
PG  - 9-18
AB  - Purpose: Opioid maintenance treatment reduces a person’s use of heroin. However, 
      frequent substance use in treatment is a problem. Aim: To examine the association
      between opioid maintenance treatment and opioid/polydrug use, and whether social 
      factors, adverse experiences, social resources, and quality of life are
      associated with opioid/polydrug use during the first 12 months in treatment.
      Patients and Methods: Forty-seven participants from treatment units in Bergen,
      Norway participated in five waves of data collection. Every third month, a
      structured face-to-face interview collected self-reported data on
      sociodemographic characteristics, opioid/polydrug use, participants’ social
      resources or adverse experiences, and quality of life. Data were collected as
      part of KVARUS, the National Quality Register for Substance Abuse Treatment. A
      multilevel binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the
      association of opioid/polydrug use and time in current treatment. The analysis
      included regressions of opioid/polydrug use on time-invariant baseline adverse
      experiences and social resources, and time-varying reports of quality of life.
      Results: There was a significant negative association between time in treatment
      and use of opioids, b =−0.89, SE = 0.19, p = <0.01. Furthermore, a negative
      association of age at substance use on polydrug use was found, b =−0.40, SE
      =0.19, p = 0.03. A higher overall quality of life was significantly associated
      with lower odds of opioid use during opioid maintenance treatment, b = −0.62, SE 
      = 0.23, p = < 0.01. Social dimensions, participants’ adverse experiences, and
      social resources were not associated with polydrug or opioid use. Conclusion:
      Opioid maintenance treatment is associated with lowered opioid use, but to a
      lesser degree with polydrug use. Our findings add quality of life as an important
      factor that should be given particular attention because it can offer insight to 
      aspects that can affect the patients’ opioid use.

TI  - PRESCRIPTION OPIOID MISUSE MOTIVE LATENT CLASSES: OUTCOMES FROM A NATIONALLY
      REPRESENTATIVE US SAMPLE.
PG  - e97
AB  - Aims:: Prescription opioid misuse (POM) contributes to a larger opioid crisis in 
      the US and Canada, with over 17,000 US POM-related overdose deaths in 2017. Our
      aims were to 1) identify specific profiles of respondents based on POM motives
      using the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and 2) compare
      profile respondents on sociodemographics, substance use and mental and physical
      health outcomes. Methods:: Analyses included 2017-18 NSDUH respondents with data 
      on POM motives (n= 4,810). POM was defined as prescription opioid use in a way
      not intended by the prescriber, including use without a prescription, in larger
      amounts or more frequently. Nine POM motives for the most recent episode were
      assessed, including “to relieve physical pain” and “to get high”. Latent classes,
      based on POM motives, were estimated. Classes were compared on sociodemographics,
      substance use, physical and mental health outcomes. Results:: Eight latent
      classes were identified (in order of prevalence): pain relief only, relax-pain
      relief, sleep-pain relief, multi-motive, high, experimenter, emotional coping,
      and dependent/hooked. Compared to the pain relief only group, the high and
      multi-motive classes had higher odds of all substance use outcomes, with the
      dependent/hooked class having higher odds on all but one outcome. Six of the
      eight classes had higher odds of past-year mental health treatment and suicidal
      ideation than the pain relief only class. Conclusions:: Screening for pain, pain 
      conditions, problematic substance use and psychopathology are recommended in
      those with any POM. While those in the dependent/hooked, multi-motive, and
      emotional coping classes are most likely to have prescription opioid use
      disorder, screening for opioid use disorder symptoms in all individuals with POM 
      is also warranted.

TI  - D-4F, an ApoA-I mimetic peptide ameliorating TRPA1-mediated nocifensive behaviour
      in a model of neurogenic inflammation.
LID - 1744806920903848
AB  - Background: High doses of capsaicin are recommended for the treatment of
      neuropathic pain. However, low doses evoke mechanical hypersensitivity.
      Activation of the capsaicin chemosensor transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 
      (TRPV1) induces neurogenic inflammation. In addition to the release of
      pro-inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species are produced. These highly
      reactive molecules generate oxidised phospholipids and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)
      which then directly activate TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1). The apolipoprotein A-I
      mimetic peptide D-4F neutralises oxidised phospholipids. Here, we asked whether
      D-4F ameliorates neurogenic hypersensitivity in rodents by targeting reactive
      oxygen species and 4-HNE in the capsaicin-evoked pain model. Results:
      Co-application of D-4F ameliorated capsaicin-induced mechanical hypersensitivity 
      and allodynia as well as persistent heat hypersensitivity measured by
      Randell–Selitto, von Frey and Hargreaves test, respectively. In addition,
      mechanical hypersensitivity was blocked after co-injection of D-4F with the
      reactive oxygen species analogue H2O2 or 4-HNE. In vitro studies on dorsal root
      ganglion neurons and stably transfected cell lines revealed a TRPA1-dependent
      inhibition of the calcium influx when agonists were pre-incubated with D-4F. The 
      capsaicin-induced calcium influx in TRPV1-expressing cell lines and dorsal root
      ganglion neurons sustained in the presence of D-4F. Conclusions: D-4F is a
      promising compound to ameliorate TRPA1-dependent hypersensitivity during
      neurogenic inflammation.

TI  - Responses to addiction help-seeking from Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana,

LID - 11
AB  - We investigated how intelligent virtual assistants (IVA), including Amazon’s
      Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Samsung’s Bixby, 
      responded to addiction help-seeking queries. We recorded if IVAs provided a
      singular response and if so, did they link users to treatment or treatment
      referral services. Only 4 of the 70 help-seeking queries presented to the five
      IVAs returned singular responses, with the remainder prompting confusion (e.g.,
      “did I say something wrong?”). When asked “help me quit drugs” Alexa responded
      with a definition for the word drugs. “Help me quit…smoking” or “tobacco” on
      Google Assistant returned Dr. QuitNow (a cessation app), while on Siri “help me
      quit pot” promoted a marijuana retailer. IVAs should be revised to promote free, 
      remote, federally sponsored addiction services, such as SAMSHA’s 1-800-662-HELP
      helpline. This would benefit millions of IVA users now and more to come as IVAs
      displace existing information-seeking engines.

TI  - The identification of risk factors contributing to accidental opioid poisonings
      in companion dogs using data from a North American poison control center
      (2006-2014).
LID - e0227701
AB  - In the last decade, there has been a marked increase in opioid-related human
      deaths in the U.S. However, the effects of the growth in opioid use on vulnerable
      populations, such as pet dogs, are largely unknown. The objective of this study
      was to investigate potential risk factors at the dog, county, and state-levels
      that contributed to accidental dog opioid poisonings. Dog demographic information
      was collected during calls to the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC), operated
      by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, about pet dog
      exposures to poisons from 2006–2014. Data concerning state-level opioid-related
      human death rates and county-level human opioid prescription rates were collected
      from databases accessed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A
      multilevel logistic regression model with random intercepts for county and state 
      was fitted to explore associations between the odds of a call to the APCC being
      related to dog opioid poisonings with the following independent variables: sex,
      weight, age, reproductive status, breed class, year, source of calls,
      county-level human opioid prescription rate, and state-level opioid human death
      rate. There was a significant non-linear positive association between accidental 
      opioid dog poisoning calls and county-level human opioid prescription rates.
      Similarly, the odds of a call being related to an opioid poisoning significantly 
      declined over the study period. Depending on the breed class, the odds of a call 
      being related to an opioid poisoning event were generally lower for older and
      heavier dogs. The odds of a call being related to an opioid poisoning were
      significantly higher for intact compared to neutered dogs, and if the call was
      made by a veterinarian compared to a member of the public. Veterinarians
      responding to poisonings may benefit from knowledge of trends in the use and
      abuse of both legal and illegal drugs in human populations.

TI  - Effect of postoperative Trendelenburg position on shoulder pain after
      gynecological laparoscopic procedures: a randomized clinical trial.
LID - 27
AB  - Background: Laparoscopic surgery has become a standard of care for many
      gynecological surgeries due to its lower morbidity, pain and cost compared to
      open techniques. Unfortunately, the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) to insufflate the
      abdomen is the main contributor to post-operative shoulder pain. Methods: We aim 
      to assess the effect of postoperative Trendelenburg position on shoulder pain
      after gynecological laparoscopic procedures. We hypothesize that maintaining the 
      patient in Trendelenburg for 24 h postoperatively will significantly decrease
      postoperative shoulder pain and analgesic consumption. After obtaining written
      informed consent, 108 patients were prospectively randomized into two groups. In 
      the control group, patients underwent standard gynecologic laparoscopic
      procedures; then after passive deflation of the pneumoperitoneum at the end of
      the surgery, the patients were placed in supine head up position in the post
      anesthesia care unit (PACU) and received our institution’s common postoperative
      care. Patients in the intervention group were subjected to the same maneuver but 
      were positioned in a Trendelenburg position (20 °) once fully awake and
      cooperative in the PACU and retained this position for the first 24 h. Numerical 
      rating scale (NRS) was used to assess shoulder pain and nausea upon patient
      arrival to the PACU, at 4, 6, 12 (primary outcome) and 24 h postoperatively. Time
      to first rescue pain medication, total rescue pain medications and overall
      satisfaction with pain control were recorded. 101 patients were included in the
      final data analysis. Results: Both groups were comparable in terms of baseline
      characteristics. NRS pain scores were significantly lower in the intervention
      group at 12 h compared to the control group (0 [0–1] versus 5 [1–4], p < 0.001), 
      furthermore improvement in postoperative shoulder pain between time of arrival to
      PACU (time zero) and 12 h postoperatively was significantly higher in patients
      allocated to the experimental group compared to the control group. Pain scores
      were significantly lower in patients allocated to the experimental group versus
      the control group (0 [0–1] versus 5 [1–4], p < 0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion,
      Trendelenburg position is an easy non-pharmacologic intervention that is
      beneficial in reducing postoperative shoulder pain following gynecologic
      laparoscopic surgery. Trial registration: Retrospectively registered at

TI  - The neurocognitive function change criteria after whole-brain radiation therapy
      for brain metastasis, in reference to health-related quality of life changes: a
      prospective observation study.
LID - 66
AB  - Background: We sought to construct the optimal neurocognitive function (NCF)
      change criteria sensitive to health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in patients 
      who have undergone whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for brain metastasis.
      Methods: We categorized the patients by the changes of NCF into groups of
      improvement versus deterioration if at least one domain showed changes that
      exceeded the cut-off while other domains remained stable. The remaining patients 
      were categorized as stable, and the patients who showed both significant
      improvement and deterioration were categorized as ‘both.’ We examined the
      clinical meaning of NCF changes using the cut-off values 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 SD
      based on the percentage of patients whose HR-QOL changes were ≥ 10 points.
      Results: Baseline, 4-month and 8-month data were available in 78, 41 (compliance;
      85%), and 29 (81%) patients, respectively. At 4 months,
      improvement/stable/deterioration/both was seen in 15%/12%/41%/32% of the patients
      when 1.0 SD was used; 19%/22%/37%/22% with 1.5 SD, and 17%/37%/37%/9% with 2.0
      SD. The HR-QOL scores on the QLQ-C30 functional scale were significantly worse in
      the deterioration group versus the others with 1.0 SD (p = 0.013) and 1.5 SD
      (p = 0.015). With 1.5 SD, the HR-QOL scores on the QLQ-BN20 was significantly
      better in the improvement group versus the others (p = 0.033). However, when
      ‘both’ was included in ‘improvement’ or ‘deterioration,’ no significant
      difference in HR-QOL was detected. Conclusions: The NCF cut-off of 1.5 SD and the
      exclusion of ‘both’ patients from the ‘deterioration’ and ‘improvement’ groups
      best reflects HR-QOL changes.

TI  - Cannabis Sativa Revisited—Crosstalk between microRNA Expression, Inflammation,
      Oxidative Stress, and Endocannabinoid Response System in Critically Ill Patients 
      with Sepsis.
LID - 307
AB  - Critically ill patients with sepsis require a multidisciplinary approach, as this
      situation implies multiorgan distress, with most of the bodily biochemical and
      cellular systems being affected by the condition. Moreover, sepsis is
      characterized by a multitude of biochemical interactions and by dynamic changes
      of the immune system. At the moment, there is a gap in our understanding of the
      cellular, genetic, and molecular mechanisms involved in sepsis. One of the
      systems intensely studied in recent years is the endocannabinoid signaling
      pathway, as light was shed over a series of important interactions of cannabinoid
      receptors with biochemical pathways, specifically for sepsis. Furthermore, a
      series of important implications on inflammation and the immune system that are
      induced by the activity of cannabinoid receptors stimulated by the
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) have been noticed.
      One of the most important is their ability to reduce the biosynthesis of
      pro-inflammatory mediators and the modulation of immune mechanisms. Different
      studies have reported that cannabinoids can reduce oxidative stress at
      mitochondrial and cellular levels. The aim of this review paper was to present,
      in detail, the important mechanisms modulated by the endocannabinoid signaling
      pathway, as well as of the molecular and cellular links it has with sepsis. At
      the same time, we wish to present the possible implications of cannabinoids in
      the most important biological pathways involved in sepsis, such as inflammation, 
      redox activity, immune system, and epigenetic expression.

TI  - A Census of Medicolegal Death Investigation in the United States: A Need to
      Determine the State of our Nation’s Toxicology Laboratories and Their
      Preparedness for the Current Drug Overdose Epidemic†, ‡.
PG  - 544-9
AB  - In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported on 2004 data collected from
      the Census of Medical Examiner and Coroner Offices (CMEC). The CMEC was one of
      the first comprehensive reports on the state of the medicolegal death
      investigation system in the United States and included information on
      administration, expenditure, workload, specialized death investigations, records 
      and evidence retention, and resources. However, the report did not include
      responses on questions that were related to toxicology such as specimen retention
      and type of testing. The purpose of this publication is to provide the community 
      with toxicology laboratory‐specific responses from nearly 2000 medical examiner
      and coroner (MEC) offices. Data obtained from a BJS CMEC public use dataset for
      any remaining information that was not reported in the 2007 BJS report were
      evaluated specific to the operation of toxicology laboratories within a MEC
      office or specific to toxicology testing. The CMEC includes information on
      average operating budget for MEC offices with internal or external toxicology
      services, budget for toxicology/microbiology services, respondents’ routine uses 
      of toxicology analysis, toxicology specimen retention time, average turnaround
      times, use of computerized information management systems, and participation in
      federal data collections. These historical data begin to address the present
      state of our nation’s toxicology laboratories within the medicolegal death
      investigation system and their preparedness for the current drug overdose
      epidemic.

TI  - Clinical outcome of transurethral enucleation of the prostate using the 120-W
      thulium Laser (Vela™ XL) compared to bipolar transurethral resection of the
      prostate (TURP) in aging male.
PG  - 1888-98
AB  - This study compared the surgical outcomes of the 120-W Thulium laser (Vela™ XL)
      enucleation of the prostate and bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate
      (TURP) in terms of efficacy, safety, and improvements of quality of life (QoL) in
      patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Records were obtained from
      January 2014 to September 2018 for selected patients with symptomatic BPH who
      underwent 120-W Thulium laser (Vela™XL) prostate enucleation and bipolar TURP in 
      our institution. All the patients selected met the surgical criteria for TURP and
      had received medical treatment for at least 3 months. Patients were excluded if
      their ECOG performance status was >1, if they had active malignant disease, of if
      they had a history of prostate surgery or reconstruction surgery of the urinary
      system. Patients decided which treatment option would be performed. Both the
      procedures were conducted by a single surgeon. Clinical outcomes such as changes 
      in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) score, urodynamic parameters, 
      drug consumption, pain scores, and QoL were evaluated. The rate of urinary tract 
      infection, recatheterization, additional analgesic requirement, return to the
      emergency department for treatment, and other surgical complications was analyzed
      and compared between the two cohorts. A total of 276 patients met the inclusion
      criteria. Among them, 141 patients received bipolar TURP, where as 135 decided to
      receive laser vaporesection. No significant difference was observed in age, PSA
      level, prostate volume, and comorbidities between the two cohorts. Pre-operative 
      (pre-op) urodynamic parameters were also identical, except that the laser surgery
      group had a higher rate of admission with a urinary catheter (24.4% vs. 14.2%,
      p=0.044). The operating time was longer in the laser surgery group (79.3 minutes 
      vs. 62.4 minutes, p<0.001). However, enucleation using the Thulium laser was
      superior to bipolar TURP in terms of post-operative (post-op) pain status,
      including the numeric rating scale of pain, rate of additional narcotic use, and 
      oral analgesic requirement. Compared with bipolar TURP, laser enucleation
      achieved a higher improvement in the QoL score at post-op follow-up at 2 weeks
      and 3 months. Nevertheless, the complication rate, changes in IPSS score, Qmax,
      and post-op medication-free survival were statistically identical in the two
      cohorts. Our data revealed that compared with bipolar TURP, 120-W Thulium laser
      (Vela™ XL) enucleation of the prostate achieved lower post-op pain and higher
      improvement in the short-term QoL of patients after surgery.

TI  - Economic Evaluation of Hepatitis C Treatment Extension to Acute Infection and
      Early-Stage Fibrosis Among Patients Who Inject Drugs in Developing Countries: A
      Case of China.
LID - 800
AB  - We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of (1) treating acute hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) vs. deferring treatment until the chronic phase and (2) treating all
      chronic patients vs. only those with advanced fibrosis; among Chinese genotype 1b
      treatment-naïve patients who injected drugs (PWID), using a combination
      Daclatasvir (DCV) plus Asunaprevir (ASV) regimen and a Peg-interferon
      (PegIFN)-based regimen, respectively. A decision-analytical model including the
      risk of HCV reinfection simulated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
      (QALYs) of three treatment timings, under the DCV+ASV and PegIFN regimen,
      respectively: Treating acute infection (“Treat at acute”), treating chronic
      patients of all fibrosis stages (“Treat at F0 (no fibrosis)”), treating only
      advanced-stage fibrosis patients (“Treat at F3 (numerous septa without
      cirrhosis)”). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to compare 
      scenarios. “Treat at acute” compared with “Treat at F0” was cost-saving (cost:
      DCV+ASV regimen—US$14,486.975 vs. US$16,224.250; PegIFN-based
      regimen—US$19,734.794 vs. US$22,101.584) and more effective (QALY: DCV+ASV
      regimen—14.573 vs. 14.566; PegIFN-based regimen—14.148 vs. 14.116). Compared with
      “Treat at F3”; “Treat at F0” exhibited an ICER of US$3780.20/QALY and
      US$15,145.98/QALY under the DCV+ASV regimen and PegIFN-based regimen;
      respectively. Treatment of acute HCV infection was highly cost-effective and
      cost-saving compared with deferring treatment to the chronic stage; for both
      DCV+ASV and PegIFN-based regimens. Early treatment for chronic patients with
      DCV+ASV regimen was highly cost-effective.

TI  - Patient-Controlled Intravenous Morphine Analgesia Combined with Transcranial
      Direct Current Stimulation for Post-Thoracotomy Pain: A Cost-Effectiveness Study 
      and A Feasibility for Its Future Implementation.
LID - 816
AB  - This prospective randomized study aims to evaluate the feasibility and
      cost-effectiveness of combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      with patient controlled intravenous morphine analgesia (PCA-IV) as part of
      multimodal analgesia after thoracotomy. Patients assigned to the active treatment
      group (a-tDCS, n = 27) received tDCS over the left primary motor cortex for five 
      days, whereas patients assigned to the control group (sham-tDCS, n = 28) received
      sham tDCS stimulations. All patients received postoperative PCA-IV morphine. For 
      cost-effectiveness analysis we used data about total amount of PCA-IV morphine
      and maximum visual analog pain scale with cough (VASP-Cmax). Direct costs of
      hospitalization were assumed as equal for both groups. Cost-effectiveness
      analysis was performed with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER),
      expressed as the incremental cost (RSD or US$) per incremental gain in mm of
      VASP-Cmax reduction. Calculated ICER was 510.87 RSD per VASP-Cmax 1 mm reduction.
      Conversion on USA market (USA data 1.325 US$ for 1 mg of morphine) revealed ICER 
      of 189.08 US$ or 18960.39 RSD/1 VASP-Cmax 1 mm reduction. Cost-effectiveness
      expressed through ICER showed significant reduction of PCA-IV morphine costs in
      the tDCS group. Further investigation of tDCS benefits with regards to reduction 
      of postoperative pain treatment costs should also include the long-term benefits 
      of reduced morphine use.

TI  - Screening for depression among a sample of US college students who engage in
      recreational prescription opioid misuse.
PG  - 59-65
AB  - Background: Among student populations, literature has identified associations
      between prescription opioid misuse and symptoms of depression such as
      hopelessness, sadness, and emotional pain. Thus far, existing literature has yet 
      to investigate associations between prescription opioid misuse and depression
      using validated screening instruments for depression when exploring such
      associations. The purpose of this study was to utilize a validated screening tool
      to explore quantifiable presence of depression among college students who engage 
      in recreational prescription opioid misuse (RPOM). Additionally, gender
      differences in depression and co-occurring substance use are examined.Methods:
      Students (n = 104) of a large university in the Southeastern United States who
      reported ROM within the past 6 months completed instrumentation assessing
      demographics, substance use, as well as, screening tools for depression and
      possible opioid use disorder (OUD). Results: Positive depression screens were
      significantly higher among females, however, nearly56% of participants screened
      positive for major depression. Though high levels of co-occurring substance use
      were observed among the entire sample, males were significantly more likely to
      report cocaine use, more frequent use of alcohol and marijuana, as well as,
      exhibit a positive screen for disordered opioid use, at a rate 5 times that of
      their female counterparts. Conclusion: Students who engage in RPOM are a
      particularly heightened-risk subsample of the college population who exhibit high
      levels of depressive symptomatology and substance use behavior. Targeted
      programming and further investigations are needed among this specific population.
      Future studies are encouraged to utilize validated instruments when assessing
      depression among students.

TI  - Prescription Pattern of Drugs Used for Neuropathic Pain and Adherence to NeuPSIG 
      Guidelines in Cancer.
PG  - 13-8
AB  - Objective:: The objective of the present research was to evaluate the
      prescription pattern of the drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of
      cancer-related neuropathic pain (CRNP) and to assess the adherence of the
      physicians to the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) Guidelines.
      Materials and Methods:: This was a cross-sectional, observational study where
      patients who presented to the pain and palliative care outpatient clinic of the
      tertiary care hospital with CRNP were prospectively recruited. Participants were 
      screened for neuropathic pain using DN4 questionnaire. Demographic details,
      diagnosis, medication details, and adherence to NeuPSIG guidelines were assessed 
      using a validated questionnaire. Results:: Of 300 patients screened, 64% were
      male and 36% were female, with a mean age of 48.26 ± 13.05 years. The predominant
      symptoms found were pin-and-needle sensation (99%) followed by tingling sensation
      (98.66%). The most common diagnosis was head-and-neck cancers (37.3%) followed by
      bone cancers (17.3%) and lung cancers (15.3%). Among the first-line drugs
      recommended in NeuPSIG for CRNP, pregabalin (78.7%) was the most common drug
      prescribed followed by amitriptyline (67%). The most common co-prescribed drugs
      were acid suppressants drugs (50.7%). Tapentadol, which is not part of the
      NeuPSIG guidelines, was prescribed on 51 occasions for neuropathic pain.
      Underdosing was observed in 272 prescriptions. Only 12 prescriptions completely
      adhered, while 275 had partial, and 13 prescriptions had poor adherence to
      NeuPSIG guidelines. Conclusion:: The most commonly used drugs in the treatment of
      CRNP were pregabalin and amitriptyline. Most physician partially or did not
      adhere to the NeuPSIG guideline in the management of CRNP.

TI  - Prolonged Intravenous Line Access in a Terminally Ill Patient, Consequences and
      Suggestions.
PG  - 137-9
AB  - Prolonged and neglected use of an intravenous (IV) line could be limb- and
      life-threatening. In many terminally sick cancer patients of rural India, pain
      management is a major concern. It is a very common practice by local
      practitioners to give IV fluids and pain medications in such patients. Where IV
      access is difficult, a secure venous cannula is kept in situ for long periods to 
      administer pain medicines and fluids. This article tries to highlight the dangers
      a neglected IV line poses to limb and life and tries to stress on the importance 
      of a subcutaneous route for pain medication administration in terminally ill
      palliative patients.

TI  - A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial Evaluating the Analgesic Effect of Salmon
      Calcitonin in Refractory Bone Metastasis Pain.
PG  - 4-8
AB  - Injection calcitonin is a natural hormone inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption
      have been used as an analgesic to control bone metastasis pain or pain due to
      osteoporosis or fracture. This randomized double blind placebo controlled trial
      was undertaken to determine the role of injection Salmon Calcitonin therapy to
      control refractory pain caused due to bone metastasis arising from cancer breast,
      lung, prostate or kidney. All patients had received palliative radiotherapy and
      were suffering unsatisfactory pain relief on NSAIDs and tab morphine. Fourteen
      days inj. calcitonin or placebo injections were administered in 23 patients
      initially as high dose induction dose (800 IU per day SC) followed 200 IU
      subcutaneous (SC) once a day. Patients were assessed for pain intensity and
      quality of life on EORTC QLQ-30 questionnaire 6 hourly for 2 days and on 7th and 
      30th day. Any incidence of hypercalcemia, bone fracture, nerve root and bone
      marrow compression were also noted. This study found a significant reduction in
      pain after SC calcitonin injection therapy at 14 and 30 days' assessment. No
      patients in the study group required rescue analgesia after 18 hrs. There was a
      statistically significant difference in rescue analgesics required between the
      groups during two days hospitalization. Global health as well as physical and
      social wellbeing was better at 30 and 90 days in the study group as compared to
      control group, however it could not reach a statistical significance which may be
      attributed to the small sample size of the study.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Initiation of Strong Opioids in Cancer Patients on
      Palliative Care: An Audit from a Tertiary Cancer Center in India.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - Aim:: This audit was done to analyze the factors influencing the use of strong
      opioids in cancer patients receiving comprehensive palliative care from a
      tertiary institute. Materials and Methods:: Case records of patients registered
      for palliative care at our center in 3 months were retrospectively reviewed and
      followed up throughout the course of their illness. Demographic factors, prior
      treatments, social support system, analgesic use at registration, and use of
      radiation and adjuvant analgesics were recorded. Strong opioid use and their time
      of initiation were evaluated, and multivariate analysis was used to identify the 
      factors correlating with the above. Results:: After registration, strong opioids 
      were initiated in 16% of the patients. It was observed that patients younger than
      55 years and those with visceral metastases and history of use of weak opioids at
      the time of registration had a higher probability of being started on strong
      opioids. Factors associated with a significantly longer strong opioid-free
      interval were having spouse as primary caregiver, presence of skeletal
      metastases, use of palliative radiotherapy, and low socioeconomic status.
      Conclusion:: It is certain that the use of strong opioids for adequate analgesia 
      is a necessity for palliative-care patients. However, optimal utilization of
      adjunctive analgesic modalities, coupled with good supportive care, can minimize 
      the requirement and duration of strong opioid use, especially in developing
      countries with limited access to specialist palliative care.

AB  - Pain adversely affects the quality of life in cancer patients. Although
      conventional oral analgesics and co-analgesics manage 80%–90% of pain,
      interventional pain management techniques may be useful in the management of
      cancer pain refractory to opioid analgesia or in patients unable to tolerate
      systemic opioids. Herein, we report three cases depicting the successful role of 
      erector spinae plane block in our palliative care unit for the management of
      different chronic cancer pain.

      Management: A Pharmacogenomics Perspective.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - The global cancer burden is significantly increasing at an alarming rate
      affecting patients, relatives, communities, and health-care system. Cancer
      patients require adequate pain relief and palliative care throughout the life
      course, especially in terminal illness. Although opioid treatment is successful
      in majority of patients, around 40% do not achieve enough analgesia or are prone 
      to serious side effects and toxicity. The treatment of medical conditions with
      cannabis and cannabinoid compounds is constantly expanding. This review organizes
      the current knowledge in the context of SNPs associated with opioids and
      nonopioids and its clinical consequences in pain management and pharmacogenetic
      targets of cannabinoids, for use in clinical practice.

      a Patient with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.
PG  - 134-6
AB  - Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) refers to the chronic neuropathic pain that persists
      beyond the initial varicella-zoster rash. Patients with chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) are susceptible to infections because of decreased immunity.
      Various treatment strategies including pharmacological, nonpharmacological, and
      interventional techniques have been described in the literature. We report the
      successful management of PHN with lumbar erector spinae plane block in a patient 
      of CLL.

PG  - 36-42
AB  - Viral infections of the oral cavity usually manifest as either ulceration or
      blistering presentation of oral tissues. Oral viral infections are encountered in
      dental practice but received less clinical interest due to the lesser frequency
      of patients and diagnostic challenges. The clinical presentation, pathogenic
      mechanism, investigations, and management of oral viral infections are integrated
      into the article which will enable general dentists to develop critical thinking 
      processes on differential diagnosis and management through a multidisciplinary
      approach with specialist dentists.

TI  - A sleep disturbance after total knee arthroplasty.
PG  - 119-24
AB  - Background:: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is common arthritis in elderly. Total knee 
      arthroplasty; (TKA) is effective to restore mobility and improve quality of life 
      in patients with OA. One of TKA complications is sleep disturbance. Objective::
      Aim was to evaluate sleep disturbance after TKA despite differences in
      postoperative pain managements. Methods:: Prospective cohort study was performed 
      on 67 patients who underwent primary TKA by different surgeons during May to
      March 2019. Samples were collected randomly from different hospitals in
      Sulaimani, Kurdistan, Iraq. Sleep pattern was assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI) and pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) for
      three months postoperatively. Results:: Mean ± standard deviation (SD) age (year)
      and body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) of participants were 64.2 ± 7.5 (range: 40–82)
      and 27.3 ± 3.7 (range: 21.3–41.6), respectively. About 83.6% were females with
      male to female ratio of (0.2:1). There were statistically insignificant
      associations of age, gender, BMI, and history of diabetes mellitus with PSQI.
      Degree of pain was gradually decreasing during follow-up, but sleep was better at
      beginning followed by peaked disturbance after one month, then it started to
      improve gradually at end of follow-up. Conclusions:: Sleep disturbance assessment
      needs multimodal approaches in order to improve it and satisfy patients.

TI  - Activation of Melanocortin-4 Receptor Inhibits Both Neuroinflammation Induced by 
      Early Exposure to Ethanol and Subsequent Voluntary Alcohol Intake in Adulthood in
      Animal Models: Is BDNF the Key Mediator?
LID - 5
AB  - The concept that neuroinflammation induced by excessive alcohol intake in
      adolescence triggers brain mechanisms that perpetuate consumption has
      strengthened in recent years. The melanocortin system, composed of the
      melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and its ligand α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone
      (α-MSH), has been implicated both in modulation of alcohol consumption and in
      ethanol-induced neuroinflammation decrease. Chronic alcohol consumption in
      adolescent rats causes a decrease in an α-MSH release by the hypothalamus, while 
      the administration of synthetic agonists of MC4R causes a decrease in
      neuroinflammation and a decrease in voluntary alcohol consumption. However, the
      mechanism that connects the activation of MC4R with the decrease of both
      neuroinflammation and voluntary alcohol consumption has not been elucidated.
      Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in alcohol drinking 
      motivation, dependence and withdrawal, and its levels are reduced in alcoholics. 
      Deficiencies in BDNF levels increased ethanol self-administration in rats.
      Further, BDNF triggers important anti-inflammatory effects in the brain, and this
      could be one of the mechanisms by which BDNF reduces chronic alcohol intake.
      Interestingly, MC4R signaling induces BDNF expression through the activation of
      the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). We hypothesize that ethanol
      exposure during adolescence decreases the expression of α-MSH and hence MC4R
      signaling in the hippocampus, leading to a lower BDNF activity that causes
      dramatic changes in the brain (e.g., neuroinflammation and decreased
      neurogenesis) that predispose to maintain alcohol abuse until adulthood. The
      activation of MC4R either by α-MSH or by synthetic agonist peptides can induce
      the expression of BDNF, which would trigger several processes that lead to lower 
      alcohol consumption.

TI  - Effect of Morning Light Glasses and Night Short-Wavelength Filter Glasses on
      Sleep-Wake Rhythmicity in Medical Inpatients.
LID - 5
AB  - Sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are common amongst medical inpatients. They 
      are caused by a mixture of factors, including noise, loss of habitual daily
      routines, and abnormal exposure to light, which tends to be insufficient in the
      day and too high at night. The aim of the present study was to test the efficacy 
      of morning light therapy plus night short-wavelength filter glasses on sleep
      quality/timing, and sleepiness/mood over the daytime hours, in a group of
      well-characterized medical inpatients. Thirty-three inpatients were enrolled and 
      randomized (2:1) to either treatment (n = 22; 13 males, 48.3 ± 13.3 years) or
      standard of care (n = 11; 8 males, 56.9 ± 12.9 years). On admission, all
      underwent a baseline assessment of sleep quality/timing and diurnal preference.
      During hospitalization they underwent monitoring of sleep quality/timing (sleep
      diaries and actigraphy), plus hourly assessment of sleepiness/mood during the
      daytime hours on one, standard day of hospitalization. Patients in the treatment 
      arm were administered bright light through glasses immediately after awakening,
      and wore short-wavelength filter glasses in the evening hours. Treated and
      untreated patients were comparable in terms of demographics, disease
      severity/comorbidity, diurnal preference and pre-admission sleep quality/timing. 
      During hospitalization, sleep diaries documented a trend for a lower number of
      night awakenings in treated compared to untreated patients (1.6 ± 0.8 vs. 2.4 ±
      1.3, p = 0.057). Actigraphy documented significantly earlier day mode in treated 
      compared to untreated patients (06:39 ± 00:35 vs. 07:44 ± 00:40, p = 0.008).
      Sleepiness during a standard day of hospitalization, recorded between 09:30 and
      21:30, showed physiological variation in treated compared to untreated patients, 
      who exhibited a more blunted profile. The level of sleepiness reported by treated
      patients was lower over the 09:30–14:30 interval, i.e., soon after light
      administration (interaction effect: F = 2.661; p = 0.026). Mood levels were
      generally higher in treated patients, with statistically significant differences 
      over the 09:30–14:30 time interval, i.e., soon after light administration
      (treatment: F = 5.692, p = 0.026). In conclusion, treatment with morning bright
      light and short-wavelength filter glasses in the evening, which was well
      tolerated, showed positive results in terms of sleepiness/mood over the morning
      hours and a trend for decreased night awakenings.

TI  - Acid and inflammatory sensitisation of naked mole-rat colonic afferent nerves.
LID - 1744806920903150
AB  - Acid sensing in the gastrointestinal tract is required for gut homeostasis and
      the detection of tissue acidosis caused by ischaemia, inflammation and infection.
      In the colorectum, activation of colonic afferents by low pH contributes to
      visceral hypersensitivity and abdominal pain in human disease including during
      inflammatory bowel disease. The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) shows no
      pain-related behaviour to subcutaneous acid injection and cutaneous afferents are
      insensitive to acid, an adaptation thought to be a consequence of the
      subterranean, likely hypercapnic, environment in which it lives. As such we
      sought to investigate naked mole-rat interoception within the gastrointestinal
      tract and how this differed from the mouse (Mus Musculus). Here, we show the
      presence of calcitonin gene-related peptide expressing extrinsic nerve fibres
      innervating both mesenteric blood vessels and the myenteric plexi of the smooth
      muscle layers of the naked mole-rat colorectum. Using ex vivo colonic-nerve
      electrophysiological recordings, we show differential sensitivity of naked
      mole-rat, compared to mouse, colonic afferents to acid and the prototypic
      inflammatory mediator bradykinin, but not direct mechanical stimuli. In naked
      mole-rat, but not mouse, we observed mechanical hypersensitivity to acid, whilst 
      both species sensitised to bradykinin. Collectively, these findings suggest that 
      naked mole-rat colonic afferents are capable of detecting acidic stimuli;
      however, their intracellular coupling to downstream molecular effectors of
      neuronal excitability and mechanotransduction likely differs between species.

TI  - Efficacy of continuous epidural infusion with epidural electric stimulation
      compared to that of conventional continuous epidural infusion for acute herpes
      zoster management: a retrospective study.
LID - 26
AB  - Background: Continuous epidural infusions are commonly used in clinical settings 
      to reduce the likelihood of transition to postherpetic neuralgia via pain
      control. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of conventional
      continuous epidural infusion to that of continuous epidural infusion in which the
      catheter is guided by electric stimulation to areas with neurological damage for 
      the treatment of zoster-related pain and prevention of postherpetic neuralgia.
      Methods: We analyzed the medical records of 114 patients in this study. The
      patients were divided into two groups: contrast (conventional continuous epidural
      infusion) and stimulation (continuous epidural infusion with epidural electric
      stimulation). In the contrast group, the position of the epidural catheter was
      confirmed using contrast medium alone, whereas in the stimulation group, the site
      of herpes zoster infection was identified through electric stimulation using a
      guidewire in the catheter. Clinical efficacy was assessed using a numerical
      rating scale (pain score) up to 6 months after the procedures. We compared the
      percentage of patients who showed complete remission (pain score less than 2 and 
      no further medication) in each group. We also investigated whether the patients
      required additional interventional treatment due to insufficient pain control
      during the 6-month follow-up period after each procedure. Results: After
      adjusting for confounding variables, the pain score was significantly lower in
      the stimulation group than in the contrast group for 6 months after the
      procedure. After adjustment, the odds of complete remission were 1.9-times higher
      in the stimulation group than in the contrast group (95% confidence interval
      [CI]: 0.81–4.44, P = 0.14). Patients in the contrast group were significantly
      more likely to require other interventions within 6 months of the procedure than 
      patients in the stimulation group (odds ratio: 3.62, 95% CI: 1.17–11.19,
      P = 0.03). Conclusion: Epidural drug administration to specific spinal segments
      using electric stimulation catheters may be more helpful than conventional
      continuous epidural infusion for improving pain and preventing postherpetic
      neuralgia in the acute phase of herpes zoster.

TI  - Measuring the placebo effect in carpal tunnel syndrome.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: The placebo effect can account for part of the improvement seen in
      patients undergoing any type of treatment, be it surgical or pharmacological. The
      objective of this study is to quantify the placebo effect in carpal tunnel
      syndrome treatment. Materials and methods: A double-blinded randomized trial was 
      performed with 68 patients suffering from mild to moderate carpal tunnel
      syndrome, divided into two groups with no statistically significant differences
      regarding age, weight, or degree of nerve compression. The patients were
      evaluated clinically and electromyographically before and after 2 months of
      treatment with either palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) or placebo. Results: The
      results, comparing the two groups, showed an improvement in both groups on a
      visual analogue scale (VAS) and Levine’s questionnaire, which have been reported 
      to show statistical differences in only a few items. In the placebo group, the
      mean age was 53.32 years (±13.43) and the BMI was 28.85 kg/m2 (±4.84). Before
      treatment, the average symptom severity score (SSS) on the Levine questionnaire
      was 2.57 (±0.74) and the functional status score (FSS) was 2.24 (±0.66). After
      treatment, these decreased to 2.11 (±0.81) and 1.96 (±0.77), being statistically 
      nonsignificant for SSS (p = 0.0865) but significant for FSS (p = 0.0028). VAS
      showed a statistically nonsignificant decrease from 4.06 to 3.25 (p = 0.3407).
      After placebo treatment, SSS, FSS, and VAS improved by 0.46, 0.28, and 0.81
      points or 17.89%, 12.5%, and 19.95%, respectively. Conclusions: These results
      show an improvement in the studied parameters by up to 20%, but when compared
      with those published in literature, these show great variability due to the wide 
      variety of factors involved in the placebo effect. Several factors that affect
      the placebo effect are discussed, and the present work tries to quantify it in
      carpal tunnel syndrome. Level of Evidence: Level 2 of evidence according to “The 
      Oxford 2011 Level of Evidence.”

TI  - Staphylococcus Aureus Osteomyelitis as an Inducer of Tolerance to Escherichia
      Coli Pyelonephritis: an Experimental Study.
LID - 1345
AB  - The high incidence of osteomyelitis in vulnerable populations like those with
      multiple injuries or elderly undergoing joint arthroplasties generates the
      question what may be their responses to subsequent infection by high virulent
      isolates. Rabbits were subject to two operations at three week intervals; sham
      osteomyelitis and sham pyelonephritis (group S); sham osteomyelitis and
      Escherichia coli pyelonephritis (group P); and Staphylococcus aureus
      osteomyelitis and E. coli pyelonephritis (group OP). Survival was recorded;
      cytokine stimulation of circulating mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tissue
      myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and bacterial growth were monitored. In some
      experiments, dalbavancin treatment was given before pyelonephritis. Healthy PBMCs
      were pre-treated with bone homogenate, S. aureus or both. Mortality of groups S, 
      P and OP after induction of pyelonephritis was 0%, 50% and 8.3% respectively.
      Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) production by PBMCs was significantly lower
      in the OP group at 48 hours. E. coli bacterial load was similar in groups P and
      OP at death or sacrifice whereas the MPO activity of group OP was decreased.
      Production of TNFα was further decreased among dalbavancin treated rabbits; in
      these rabbits tissue MPO was increased. TNFα production decreased when healthy
      PBMCs pre-treated with bone homogenate, S. aureus (HKSA) or both were stimulated 
      with E. coli (HKEC); production was further decreased in the presence of
      anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR9. It is concluded that staphylococcal osteomyelitis
      modulated the innate immune responses of the host leading to protection from
      death by highly virulent E. coli. Tolerance to TLR ligands is the most likely
      mechanism of action.

TI  - Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine in preventing postoperative nausea and
      vomiting in pediatric patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - e0227904
AB  - Background: Intravenous lidocaine in adults undergoing general anesthesia has
      been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
      However, the anti-postoperative vomiting (POV) effect of lidocaine in pediatric
      patients remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with
      Trial Sequential Analysis to evaluate the effect of intravenous lidocaine on
      prevention of POV/PONV. Methods: Six databases including trial registration sites
      were searched. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the incidence of POV/PONV
      after intravenous lidocaine compared with control were included. The primary
      outcome was the incidence of POV within 24 hours after general anesthesia. The
      incidence of POV was combined as a risk ratio with 95% confidence interval using 
      a random-effect model. We used the I2 to assess heterogeneity. We evaluated the
      quality of trials using the Cochrane methodology, and we assessed quality of
      evidence using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and
      Evaluation approach. We also assessed adverse events. Results and discussion: Six
      trials with 849 patients were included, of whom 433 received intravenous
      lidocaine. Three trials evaluated the incidence of POV, and 3 evaluated the
      incidence of PONV. The overall incidence of POV within 24 hours after anesthesia 
      was 45.9% in the lidocaine group and 63.4% in the control group (risk ratio,
      0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–1.00; I2 = 32%; p = 0.05). The incidence of
      PONV within 24 hours after anesthesia was 3.73% in the lidocaine group and 4.87% 
      in the control group (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.36–1.59; I2 = 0%; p = 0.47). The
      quality of evidence was downgraded to “very low” due to the study designs,
      inconsistency, imprecision, and possible publication bias. Conclusion: Our
      meta-analysis suggests that intravenous lidocaine infusion may reduce the
      incidence of POV, however, the evidence quality was “very low.” Further trials
      with a low risk of bias are necessary.

TI  - Proteomic profiling of proteins in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in dairy
      cows with chronic lameness.
LID - e0228134
AB  - Chronic lameness affects bovine welfare and has a negative economic impact in
      dairy industry. Moreover, due to the translational gap between traditional pain
      models and new drugs development for treating chronic pain states, naturally
      occurring painful diseases could be a potential translational tool for chronic
      pain research. We therefore employed liquid chromatography tandem mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to stablish the proteomic profile of the spinal cord
      samples from lumbar segments (L2-L4) of chronic lame dairy cows. Data were
      validated and quantified through software tool (Scaffold® v 4.0) using output
      data from two search engines (SEQUEST® and X-Tandem®). Search Tool for the
      Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) analysis was performed to detect
      proteins interactions. LC-MS/MS identified a total amount of 177 proteins; of
      which 129 proteins were able to be quantified. Lame cows showed a strong
      upregulation of interacting proteins with chaperone and stress functions such as 
      Hsp70 (p < 0.006), Hsc70 (p < 0.0079), Hsp90 (p < 0.015), STIP (p > 0.0018) and
      Grp78 (p <0.0068), and interacting proteins associated to glycolytic pathway such
      as; γ-enolase (p < 0.0095), α-enolase (p < 0.013) and hexokinase-1 (p < 0.028).
      It was not possible to establish a clear network of interaction in several
      upregulated proteins in lame cows. Non-interacting proteins were mainly
      associated to redox process and cytoskeletal organization. The most relevant down
      regulated protein in lame cows was myelin basic protein (MBP) (p < 0.02). Chronic
      inflammatory lameness in cows is associated to increased expression of stress
      proteins with chaperone, metabolism, redox and structural functions. A state of
      endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) might explain
      the changes in protein expression in lame cows; however, further studies need to 
      be performed in order to confirm these findings.

TI  - Neuromuscular blockade in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: Neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) has been proposed by medical
      guidelines for early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) because of
      its survival benefits. However, new studies have provided evidence contradicting 
      these results. Method: A search was performed of the Pubmed, Scopus,
      Clinicaltrials.gov, and Virtual Health Library databases for randomized
      controlled trials (RCT) evaluating 28-day mortality in ARDS patients treated with
      NMBA within 48 h. An English language restriction was applied. Relevant data were
      extracted and pooled into risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effect model.
      Sensitivity and meta-regression analysis were performed. Results: From 2675
      studies, we included five RCTs in the analysis, for a total of 1461 patients with
      a mean PaO2/FIO2 of 104 ± 35 mmHg. The cisatracurium group had the same risk of
      death at 28 days (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78–1.03; I2 = 50%, p = 0.12) and 90 days
      (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62–1.06; I2 = 56%, p = 0.06) as the control group (no
      cisatracurium). The secondary outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration and
      ventilator-free days were not different between the two groups. Cisatracurium had
      a significantly lower risk of barotrauma than the control group with no
      difference in intensive care unit (ICU)–induced weakness. The PaO2/FIO2 ratio was
      higher in the cisatracurium group but not until 48 h. Meta-regression analysis of
      the baseline PaO2/FIO2 ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) revealed no
      heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis excluding the trial using high PEEP and light
      sedation strategy yielded an improvement in all mortality outcomes. Conclusion:
      NMBA improves oxygenation only after 48 h in moderate, severe ARDS patients and
      has a lower barotrauma risk without affecting ICU weakness. However, NMBA does
      not reduce ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation or, most
      importantly, the mortality risk regardless of the severity of ARDS.

TI  - Multicentre, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial of 10 khz
      high-frequency spinal cord stimulation for chronic neuropathic low back pain
      (MODULATE-LBP): a trial protocol.
LID - 111
AB  - Introduction: Chronic neuropathic low back pain (CNLBP) is a debilitating
      condition in which established medical treatments seldom alleviate symptoms.
      Evidence demonstrates that high-frequency 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
      reduces pain and improves health-related quality of life in patients with failed 
      back surgery syndrome (FBSS), but evidence of this effect is limited in
      individuals with CNLBP who have not had surgery. The aim of this multicentre
      randomised trial is to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 10 kHz SCS
      for this population. Methods: This is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised,
      sham-controlled trial with a parallel economic evaluation. A total of 96 patients
      with CNLBP who have not had spinal surgery will be implanted with an epidural
      lead and a sham lead outside the epidural space without a screening trial.
      Patients will be randomised 1:1 to 10 kHz SCS plus usual care (intervention
      group) or to sham 10 kHz SCS plus usual care (control group) after receiving the 
      full implant. The SCS devices will be programmed identically using a cathodal
      cascade. Participants will use their handheld programmer to alter the intensity
      of the stimulation as per routine practice. The primary outcome will be a 7-day
      daily pain diary. Secondary outcomes include the Oswestry Disability Index,
      complications, EQ-5D-5 L, and health and social care costs. Outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline (pre-randomisation) and at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months
      after device activation. The primary analyses will compare primary and secondary 
      outcomes between groups at 6 months, while adjusting for baseline outcome scores.
      Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) will be calculated at 6
      months and over the lifetime of the patient. Discussion: The outcomes of this
      trial will inform clinical practice and healthcare policy on the role of
      high-frequency 10 kHz SCS for use in patients with CNLBP who have not had
      surgery. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03470766. Registered on 20

TI  - The analgesic efficacy of bilateral superficial cervical plexus block for thyroid
      surgery under general anesthesia: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 42
AB  - Objective: Uses of simple analgesics were found insufficient to manage pain after
      thyroid surgery. We hypothesized that using bilateral superficial cervical plexus
      block (BSCPB) might influence the pattern of immediate postoperative pain and
      analgesic consumption. The general objective of the study was to assess the
      analgesic efficacy of bilateral superficial plexus block for thyroid surgery
      under general anesthesia. Results: A total of 74 willing patients involved. Half 
      of them had received BSCPB with 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine just before induction 
      and the remaining half did not. Postoperatively, patients were assessed at
      immediate, 2nd, 6th, 12th and 24th h. At all endpoints, NRS-11 scores for pain
      were significantly lower in the block group. The time to first analgesic
      requirement was significantly longer 132.3 ± 71.5 min vs 71.4 ± 60.0 min,
      p = 0.009. Opioid and total analgesic consumption were reduced by BSCPB in the
      first 24 postoperative hours. There was low but non-significant rate of PONV in
      the block group. No clinically important adverse event was noted related to
      BSCPB.Trial registration The study was registered in Pan African Clinical Trial
      Registry on 13/01/2020 and the registration number is PACTR202001579588451.
      Retrospectively registered.

TI  - Time‐to‐Event Modeling for Remimazolam for the Indication of Induction and
      Maintenance of General Anesthesia.
PG  - 505-14
AB  - Remimazolam is an ultra‐short‐acting benzodiazepine being investigated for
      induction and maintenance of general anesthesia and for procedural sedation. This
      dose‐response analysis of 4 phase 2‐3 studies evaluated covariates that may
      impact the pharmacodynamic profile (based on theoretical pharmacokinetic
      principles) and require dose adjustments in subpopulations, particularly elderly,
      and if remimazolam has cumulative properties. Covariates affecting the time to
      loss of consciousness and time to extubation were evaluated using Cox
      proportional hazards models. Factors affecting steady‐state infusion rate
      required to produce adequate sedation were evaluated using linear regression.
      Variability in time to loss of consciousness was explained by induction dose,
      age, body mass index, and time from initiation of opioids to initiation of
      remimazolam. The steady‐state infusion rate producing adequate sedation was
      higher in European than Japanese subjects due to differences in study design.
      American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class 3 subjects had a 28% 
      lower maintenance infusion rate than class 1 subjects. Other statistically
      significant covariates (American Society of Anesthesiologists class 2, estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate, and sex) resulted in small (≤14%), non–clinically
      relevant differences. Factors affecting time to extubation included the last
      infusion rate (ie, tapering), the bispectral index score at the end of infusion, 
      and sex. The time to extubation after remimazolam did not increase with increased
      cumulative dose of remimazolam or duration of surgery. This evaluation of
      remimazolam's pharmacodynamic profile, in the absence of pharmacokinetic data,
      informed dosing recommendations and showed that remimazolam does not have
      cumulative properties in the general anesthesia setting.

TI  - A Collaborative Medication Review Including Deprescribing for Older Patients in
      an Emergency Department: A Longitudinal Feasibility Study.
LID - 348
AB  - Medication review for older patients with polypharmacy in the emergency
      department (ED) is crucial to prevent inappropriate prescribing. Our objective
      was to assess the feasibility of a collaborative medication review in older
      medical patients (≥65 years) using polypharmacy (≥5 long-term medications). A
      pharmacist performed the medication review using the tools: Screening Tool of
      Older Persons’ potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria, a
      drug–drug interaction database (SFINX), and Renbase® (renal dosing database). A
      geriatrician received the medication review and decided which recommendations
      should be implemented. The outcomes were: differences in Medication
      Appropriateness Index (MAI) and Assessment of Underutilization Index (AOU) scores
      between admission and 30 days after discharge and the percentage of patients for 
      which the intervention was completed before discharge. Sixty patients were
      included from the ED, the intervention was completed before discharge for 50
      patients (83%), and 39 (61.5% male; median age 80 years) completed the follow-up 
      30 days after discharge. The median MAI score decreased from 14 (IQR 8-20) at
      admission to 8 (IQR 2-13) 30 days after discharge (p < 0.001). The number of
      patients with an AOU score ≥1 was reduced from 36% to 10% (p < 0.001). Thirty
      days after discharge, 83% of the changes were sustained and for 28 patients
      (72%), 1≥ medication had been deprescribed. In conclusion, a collaborative
      medication review and deprescribing intervention is feasible to perform in the
      ED.

TI  - Chronic femoral diaphyseal osteomyelitis with radiographs initially concerning
      for Paget disease of the bone.
PG  - 344-8
AB  - Chronic osteomyelitis can be difficult to diagnose given its similar radiographic
      appearance to other lesions. This case report describes a 48-year-old woman, who 
      presented with left thigh pain and on radiography a large disorganized sclerotic 
      lesion involving nearly the entire femoral diaphysis, concerning for Paget
      disease or malignancy. Biopsy suggested chronic osteomyelitis but did not
      identify a causative organism. Treatment with antibiotics led to resolution of
      pain and improvement of biochemical markers. This case exemplifies the role of
      radiographic imaging in the diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis and the possible
      utility of antibiotics for culture-negative chronic osteomyelitis. We review
      imaging modalities for the diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis and Paget disease.

TI  - Distinct inactive conformations of the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors correspond to
      different extents of inverse agonism.
LID - e52189
AB  - By analyzing and simulating inactive conformations of the highly homologous
      dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R), we find that eticlopride binds D2R in
      a pose very similar to that in the D3R/eticlopride structure but incompatible
      with the D2R/risperidone structure. In addition, risperidone occupies a
      sub-pocket near the Na+ binding site, whereas eticlopride does not. Based on
      these findings and our experimental results, we propose that the divergent
      receptor conformations stabilized by Na+-sensitive eticlopride and
      Na+-insensitive risperidone correspond to different degrees of inverse agonism.
      Moreover, our simulations reveal that the extracellular loops are highly dynamic,
      with spontaneous transitions of extracellular loop 2 from the helical
      conformation in the D2R/risperidone structure to an extended conformation similar
      to that in the D3R/eticlopride structure. Our results reveal previously
      unappreciated diversity and dynamics in the inactive conformations of D2R. These 
      findings are critical for rational drug discovery, as limiting a virtual screen
      to a single conformation will miss relevant ligands.

TI  - Video Game Addiction and Emotional States: Possible Confusion Between Pleasure
      and Happiness?
LID - 2894
AB  - Internet gaming disorder is characterized by a severely reduced control over
      gaming, resulting in an increasing gaming time and leading to negative
      consequences in many aspects of the individual life: personal, family, social,
      occupational and other relevant areas of functioning (World Health Organization).
      In the last years, the significant boom in using video games has been raising
      health issues that remain insufficiently understood. The extent of this
      phenomenon (the estimated prevalence is between 1.7 and 10% of the general
      population) has led the mentioned Organization to include gaming disorders in the
      list of mental health conditions (2018). Several studies show converging findings
      that highlight the common brain activities between substance use disorders and
      behavioral addictions (i.e., gaming disorders). Addiction specialists observed
      that addict subjects tend to confuse pleasure with happiness when linking
      emotional states to their addictive activities. As far as we know, beyond the
      mentioned observations, distinguishing the perception of these two emotional
      states in the frame of an addiction has not been yet the object of formal
      research. This study aims at examining the possible confusion between pleasure
      and happiness within the addiction sphere. Video game addiction has been chosen
      to explore the possible occurrence of this perceptional distortion. A mixed
      design lab-based study was carried out to compare between video games addicts and
      non-addicts (between-subjects), and video games-related activities and neutral
      activities (within-subject). Emotional reactions were gauged by self-reported
      scales and physiological data acquired through a range of biosensors: Relaxation 
      and Hearth Rate. From a therapeutic standpoint, this research intends to explore 
      alternatives to deal with this sort of disorders. More specifically, at the
      cognitive level, the idea is elaborating guidelines to develop patients’ insights
      into these emotional states and thus increasing their ability to handle them.
      Overall, several indices resulting from this study constitute a bundle of
      arguments that argue in favor of the confusion between pleasure and happiness
      made by addict users when associating their affective states to video gaming.
      Furthermore, this approach illustrates how reappraising emotions may contribute
      to reducing the perceptional distortion of these emotional states.

      (HCC).
LID - 1254
AB  - This study aims at evaluating the symptom response, response duration, and
      toxicity of single dose palliative liver radiotherapy (RT) for symptomatic HCC
      patients. We reviewed unresectable HCC patients treated with palliative RT in our
      institution. Eligible patients were unsuitable or refractory to trans-arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), with an index
      symptom of pain or abdominal discomfort. The primary outcome was the percentage
      of patients with clinical improvement of index symptom at 1 month. Secondary
      outcomes were response duration, toxicities, alpha-feto protein (AFP) response,
      and radiological response. Fifty-two patients were included in the study. The
      index symptom was pain in 34 patients (65.4%), and abdominal discomfort (34.6%)
      in 18 patients. At 1 month, 51.9% of patients had improvement of symptoms. Median
      time to symptom progression was 89 days (range: 12–392 days). Treatment was well 
      tolerated with only 2 patients (3.8%) developing grade 3 GI toxicities. AFP
      response, radiological response rate, and disease control rate at 3 months were
      48.6%, 15.1%, and 54.5% respectively. Half of the patients had improvement of
      index symptoms after receiving palliative liver RT with median response duration 
      of 3 months. The treatment was well tolerated with minimal toxicities.

TI  - Affective state determination in a mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal
      cancer.
LID - e0228413
AB  - Behavioural indicators of affective state, including burrowing, clinical scores
      and the Mouse Grimace Score have not yet been validated in mouse models of
      chronic gastrointestinal disease. Additionally, a comparison of these methods has
      not been characterised. This study aimed to determine which behavioural
      assessment was the optimal indicator of disease, evidenced by correlation with
      clinically-assessed measures, in an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulphate sodium
      (DSS) mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. C57BL/6 mice were
      allocated to four groups (n = 10/group); 1) saline control, 2)
      saline+buprenorphine, 3) AOM+DSS+water, 4) AOM+DSS+buprenorphine. Mice were
      gavaged thrice weekly with water or buprenorphine (0.5mg/kg; 80μL) for 9 weeks.
      Disease activity index (DAI) was measured daily; burrowing and grimace analyses
      occurred on days -1, 5, 19, 26, 40, 47 and 61. Colonoscopies were performed on
      days 20, 41 and 62. All animals were euthanized on day 63. Burrowing activity and
      retrospective grimace analyses were unaffected (P>0.05), whilst DAI was
      significantly increased (P<0.05) in mice with colitis-associated colorectal
      cancer compared to normal controls. In addition, DAI was positively correlated
      with colonoscopically-assessed severity and tumour number (P<0.05). We conclude
      that traditional measures of DAI or clinical scoring provide the most reliable
      assessment of wellbeing in mice with colitis-associated colorectal cancer.

TI  - Optogenetic mapping of feeding and self-stimulation within the lateral
      hypothalamus of the rat.
LID - e0224301
AB  - The lateral hypothalamus (LH) includes several anatomical subregions involved in 
      eating and reward motivation. This study explored localization of function across
      different LH subregions in controlling food intake stimulated by optogenetic
      channelrhodopsin excitation, and in supporting laser self-stimulation. We
      particularly compared the tuberal LH subregion, the posterior LH subregion, and
      the lateral preoptic area. Local diameters of tissue optogenetically stimulated
      within the LH were assessed by measuring laser-induced Fos plumes and Jun plumes 
      via immunofluorescence surrounding optic fiber tips. Those plume diameters were
      used to map localization of function for behavioral effects elicited by LH
      optogenetic stimulation. Optogenetic stimulation of the tuberal subsection of the
      LH produced the most robust eating behavior and food intake initially, but
      produced only mild laser self-stimulation in the same rats. However, after
      repeated exposures to optogenetic stimulation, tuberal LH behavioral profiles
      shifted toward more self-stimulation and less food intake. By contrast,
      stimulation of the lateral preoptic area produced relatively little food intake
      or self-stimulation, either initially or after extended stimulation experience.
      Stimulation in the posterior LH subregion supported moderate self-stimulation,
      but not food intake, and at higher laser intensity shifted valence to evoke
      escape behaviors. We conclude that the tuberal LH subregion may best mediate
      stimulation-bound increases in food intake stimulated by optogenetic excitation. 
      However, incentive motivational effects of tuberal LH stimulation may shift
      toward self-stimulation behavior after repeated stimulation. By contrast, the
      lateral preoptic area and posterior LH do not as readily elicit either eating
      behavior or laser self-stimulation, and may be more prone to higher-intensity
      aversive effects.

TI  - Improving opioid guideline adherence: evaluation of a multifaceted,
      theory-informed pilot intervention for family physicians.
LID - e032167
AB  - Objectives: Opioid-related deaths continue to increase in North America, an
      epidemic that was initiated by high rates of opioid prescribing. We designed a
      multifaceted, theory-informed Opioid Self-Assessment (OSA) package, to increase
      adherence to the Canadian Opioid Guideline among family physicians. This study
      aimed to assess changes in Canadian family physicians’ knowledge and practices
      after completing the OSA package. Design: We conducted a mixed-method evaluation 
      using a pre-test and post-test design that involved the collection of both
      qualitative and quantitative data. Setting: This research was conducted in the
      primary care setting in Ontario, Canada. Participants: We recruited a purposive
      sample of nine family physicians in Ontario who use long-term opioid therapy to
      treat patients with chronic pain. Interventions: The OSA package included four
      components: an online knowledge test, an online learning programme, a safe
      medication practice self-assessment questionnaire and chart audit with feedback. 
      Outcome measures: Our measures included changes in knowledge, opioid safety
      practices and physicians’ perspectives on the OSA package. Results: We found
      statistically significant improvements between pre-test and post-test knowledge
      scores at both baseline and 6-month follow-up. Physicians’ scores improved
      significantly on five of the seven core characteristics of the practice
      self-assessment questionnaire. On the chart audits, we observed an improvement in
      patient education between baseline and 6 months. Qualitative interviews showed
      that participants appreciated embedded resources in the OSA package. The
      completion of the package stimulated identification of gaps or deficits in
      practice and served as a useful reminder to discuss risk and safety with
      patients. Participants described the chart review as helpful in prompting
      discussions with their patients, identifying deficits and strengths and a
      ‘primary motivator’ for project participation. Conclusions: The OSA package has
      the potential to improve medication safety practices in primary care related to
      opioid monitoring and adherence to current opioid guidelines.

TI  - Problematic Internet Use, Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs, and Depressive
      Symptoms among Adolescents: A Large-Scale Study in China.
LID - 774
AB  - This large-scale study aimed to test, among Chinese adolescents, the association 
      between problematic Internet use (PIU), non-medical use of prescription drugs
      (NMUPD), and depressive symptoms, as well as the mediating effects of NMUPD on
      the associations above. This study used the data from the 2017 National
      School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey, and 24,345 students’
      questionnaires qualified for the analyses. Generalized linear mixed models and
      path models were performed. In the models without mediation, PIU was associated
      with depressive symptoms (unstandardized β estimate = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.25–0.27); 
      frequent use of opioid or sedative was also related to depressive symptoms
      (unstandardized β estimate for opioid = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.90–3.63; unstandardized 
      β estimate for sedative = 4.45, 95% CI = 3.02–5.88). Additionally, the results of
      the path models indicated that opioid misuse partially mediated the association
      between PIU and depressive symptoms. PIU and opioid/sedative misuse were related 
      to the increased risk of depressive symptoms, respectively. The association above
      might be complicated, and PIU may elevate the risk of opioid or sedative misuse
      and depressive symptoms, which in turn could worsen the situation of PIU and vice
      versa. Multidisciplinary health intervention programs to prevent adolescents
      involving in PIU, as well as NMPUD, are recommended to be provided.

TI  - Awareness during emergence from anesthesia: Features and future research
      directions.
PG  - 245-54
AB  - The anesthesia awareness with recall (AAWR) phenomenon represents a complication 
      of general anesthesia consisting of memorization of intraoperative events
      reported by the patient immediately after the end of surgery or at a variable
      distance from it. Approximately 20% of AAWR cases occur during emergence from
      anesthesia. Clinically, these unexpected experiences are often associated with
      distress especially due to a sense of paralysis. Indeed, although AAWR at the
      emergence has multiple causes, in the majority of cases the complication develops
      when the anesthesia plan is too early lightened at the end of anesthesia and
      there is a lack of use, or misuse, of neuromuscular monitoring with improper
      management of the neuromuscular block. Because the distress caused by the sense
      of paralysis represents an important predictor for the development of severe
      psychological complications, the knowledge of the phenomenon, and the possible
      strategies for its prophylaxis are aspects of considerable importance.
      Nevertheless, a limited percentage of episodes of AAWR cannot be prevented. This 
      paradox holds also during the emergence phase of anesthesia which represents a
      very complex neurophysiological process with many aspects yet to be clarified.

TI  - Trigeminal neuralgia: An overview from pathophysiology to pharmacological
      treatments.
LID - 1744806920901890
AB  - The trigeminal nerve (V) is the fifth and largest of all cranial nerves, and it
      is responsible for detecting sensory stimuli that arise from the craniofacial
      area. The nerve is divided into three branches: ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), 
      and mandibular (V3); their cell bodies are located in the trigeminal ganglia and 
      they make connections with second-order neurons in the trigeminal brainstem
      sensory nuclear complex. Ascending projections via the trigeminothalamic tract
      transmit information to the thalamus and other brain regions responsible for
      interpreting sensory information. One of the most common forms of craniofacial
      pain is trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden,
      brief, and excruciating facial pain attacks in one or more of the V branches,
      leading to a severe reduction in the quality of life of affected patients.
      Trigeminal neuralgia etiology can be classified into idiopathic, classic, and
      secondary. Classic trigeminal neuralgia is associated with neurovascular
      compression in the trigeminal root entry zone, which can lead to demyelination
      and a dysregulation of voltage-gated sodium channel expression in the membrane.
      These alterations may be responsible for pain attacks in trigeminal neuralgia
      patients. The antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are the
      first-line pharmacological treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. Their mechanism of
      action is a modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a decrease in
      neuronal activity. Although carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are the first-line
      treatment, other drugs may be useful for pain control in trigeminal neuralgia.
      Among them, the anticonvulsants gabapentin, pregabalin, lamotrigine and
      phenytoin, baclofen, and botulinum toxin type A can be coadministered with
      carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine for a synergistic approach. New pharmacological
      alternatives are being explored such as the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine,
      eslicarbazepine, and the new Nav1.7 blocker vixotrigine. The pharmacological
      profiles of these drugs are addressed in this review.

TI  - High Efficacy by GAL-021: A Known Intravenous Peripheral Chemoreceptor Modulator 
      that Suppresses BKCa-Channel Activity and Inhibits IK(M) or Ih.
LID - 188
AB  - GAL-021 has recently been developed as a novel breathing control modulator.
      However, modifications of ionic currents produced by this agent remain uncertain,
      although its efficacy in suppressing the activity of big-conductance
      Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels has been reported. In pituitary tumor (GH3)
      cells, we found that the presence of GAL-021 decreased the amplitude of
      macroscopic Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK(Ca)) in a concentration-dependent
      manner with an effective IC50 of 2.33 μM. GAL-021-mediated reduction of IK(Ca)
      was reversed by subsequent application of verteporfin or ionomycin; however, it
      was not by that of diazoxide. In inside-out current recordings, the addition of
      GAL-021 to the bath markedly decreased the open-state probability of BKCa
      channels. This agent also resulted in a rightward shift in voltage dependence of 
      the activation curve of BKCa channels; however, neither the gating charge of the 
      curve nor single-channel conductance of the channel was changed. There was an
      evident lengthening of the mean closed time of BKCa channels in the presence of
      GAL-021, with no change in mean open time. The GAL-021 addition also suppressed
      M-type K+ current with an effective IC50 of 3.75 μM; however, its presence did
      not alter the amplitude of erg-mediated K+ current, or mildly suppressed
      delayed-rectifier K+ current. GAL-021 at a concentration of 30 μM could also
      suppress hyperpolarization-activated cationic current. In HEK293T cells
      expressing α-hSlo, the addition of GAL-021 was also able to suppress the
      BKCa-channel open probabilities, and GAL-021-mediated suppression of BKCa-channel
      activity was attenuated by further addition of BMS-191011. Collectively, the
      GAL-021 effects presented herein do not exclusively act on BKCa channels and
      these modifications on ionic currents exert significant influence on the
      functional activities of electrically excitable cells occurring in vivo.

TI  - A Fermented Milk Product with B. lactis CNCM I-2494 and Lactic Acid Bacteria
      Improves Gastrointestinal Comfort in Response to a Challenge Diet Rich in
      Fermentable Residues in Healthy Subjects.
LID - 320
AB  - Background: Healthy plant-based diets rich in fermentable residues may induce
      gas-related symptoms. Our aim was to determine the potential of a fermented milk 
      product with probiotics in improving digestive comfort with such diets. Methods: 
      In an open design, a 3-day high-residue diet was administered to healthy subjects
      (n = 74 included, n = 63 completed) before and following 28 days consumption of a
      fermented milk product (FMP) containing Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis
      CNCM I-2494 and lactic acid bacteria. Main outcomes: digestive sensations, number
      of daytime anal gas evacuations, and gas volume evacuated during 4 h after a
      probe meal. Results: As compared to the habitual diet, the high-residue diet
      induced gas-related symptoms (flatulence score 4.9 vs. 1.2; p ≤ 0.0001),
      increased the daily number of anal gas evacuations (20.7 vs. 8.7; p < 0.0001),
      and impaired digestive well-being (1.0 vs. 3.4; p < 0.05). FMP consumption
      reduced flatulence sensation (by −1.7 [−1.9; −1.6]; p < 0.0001), reduced the
      number of daily evacuations (by −5.8 [−6.5; −5.1]; p < 0.0001), and improved
      digestive well-being (by +0.6 [+0.4; +0.7]; p < 0.05). FMP consumption did not
      affect the gas volume evacuated after a probe meal. Conclusion: In healthy
      subjects, consumption of a FMP containing B. lactis CNCM I-2494 and lactic acid
      bacteria improves the tolerance of a flatulogenic diet by subjective and
      objective criteria (sensations and number of anal gas evacuations, respectively).

TI  - Transdiagnostic or Disorder Specific? Indicators of Substance and Behavioral
      Addictions Nominated by People with Lived Experience.
LID - 334
AB  - Using a transdiagnostic perspective, the present research examined the prominent 
      indicators of substance (alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, tobacco) and behavioral
      (gambling, video games, sex, shopping, work, eating) addictions nominated by
      people with lived experiences. Specifically, we aimed to explore whether the
      perceived most important indicators nominated were consistent across the 10
      addictions or differed based on the specific addiction. Additionally, we explored
      gender differences in the perceived most important indicators across addictive
      behaviors. A large online sample of adults recruited from a Canadian province (n 
      = 3503) were asked to describe the most important signs or symptoms of problems
      with these substances and behaviors. Open-ended responses were analyzed among a
      subsample of 2603 respondents (n = 1562 in the past year) who disclosed that they
      had personally experienced a problem with at least one addiction listed above.
      Content analyses revealed that dependence (e.g., craving, impairments in control)
      and patterns of use (e.g., frequency) were the most commonly perceived indicators
      for both substance and behavioral addictions, accounting for over half of all the
      qualitative responses. Differences were also found between substance and
      behavioral addictions regarding the proportion of the most important signs
      nominated. Consistent with the syndrome model of addiction, unique indicators
      were also found for specific addictive behaviors, with the greatest proportion of
      unique indicators found for eating. Supplemental analyses found that perceived
      indicators across addictions were generally gender invariant. Results provide
      some support for a transdiagnostic conceptualization of substance and behavioral 
      addictions. Implications for the study, prevention, and treatment of addictions
      are discussed.

TI  - G protein‐biased kratom‐alkaloids and synthetic carfentanil‐amide opioids as
      potential treatments for alcohol use disorder.
PG  - 1497-513
AB  - Background and Purpose: Mitragyna speciosa, more commonly known as kratom, is a
      plant that contains opioidergic alkaloids but is unregulated in most countries.
      Kratom is used in the self‐medication of chronic pain and to reduce illicit and
      prescription opioid dependence. Kratom may be less dangerous than typical opioids
      because of the stronger preference of kratom alkaloids to induce receptor
      interaction with G proteins over β‐arrestin proteins. We hypothesized that kratom
      (alkaloids) can also reduce alcohol intake. Experimental Approach: We
      pharmacologically characterized kratom extracts, kratom alkaloids (mitragynine,
      7‐hydroxymitragynine, paynantheine, and speciogynine) and synthetic
      carfentanil‐amide opioids for their ability to interact with G proteins and
      β‐arrestin at μ, δ, and κ opioid receptors in vitro. We used C57BL/6 mice to
      assess to which degree these opioids could reduce alcohol intake and whether they
      had rewarding properties. Key Results: Kratom alkaloids were strongly G
      protein‐biased at all three opioid receptors and reduced alcohol intake, but
      kratom and 7‐hydroxymitragynine were rewarding. Several results indicated a key
      role for δ opioid receptors, including that the synthetic carfentanil‐amide
      opioid MP102—a G protein‐biased agonist with modest selectivity for δ opioid
      receptors—reduced alcohol intake, whereas the G protein‐biased μ opioid agonist
      TRV130 did not. Conclusion and Implications: Our results suggest that kratom
      extracts can decrease alcohol intake but still carry significant risk upon
      prolonged use. Development of more δ opioid‐selective synthetic opioids may
      provide a safer option than kratom to treat alcohol use disorder with fewer side 
      effects.

TI  - Clinicians Beware, Ewing’s Sarcoma After 60 Is Elusive and Rare!
LID - e6768
AB  - Ewing’s sarcoma is the second most common malignant bone tumor in children, with 
      the worst outcomes seen in patients over the age of 20. However, the onset of the
      disease is much less common in people over the age of 30. This case represents
      the diagnostic dilemma posed by an otherwise “straight forward” case of back
      pain. Keeping the differential diagnosis sufficiently broad to include bone
      malignancies, so as not to delay diagnosis and treatment, provides the best
      chance at a positive outcome.

      resection of colon cancer.
PG  - 2533-8
AB  - Effect of nalbuphine on patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) after
      radical resection of colon cancer was explored. Retrospective analyses of 100
      patients who underwent elective laparoscopic radical resection of colon cancer in
      Xiang Yang No. 1 People's Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine from June 2014
      to December 2016 were made. Forty-seven patients were treated with nalbuphine as 
      experimental group and 53 cases were treated with morphine as control group. All 
      patients received PCIA after surgery. According to visual analogue scale (VAS),
      pain degree at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h after surgery, total dosage of analgesia
      pump, total times and effective times of pressing were evaluated. Analgesic
      satisfaction rate, and adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness and 
      headache at the same time were observed and recorded. The postoperative VAS in
      the experimental group was evidently lower than that in the control group
      (P<0.05) at 8, 12 and 24 h after surgery, which was statistically significant.
      There was no significant difference in postoperative VAS between experimental
      group and control group at 2 and 4 h after surgery (P>0.05). The incidence of
      adverse reactions to nausea and vomiting in the experimental group was low. There
      was no significant difference in the total dosage of analgesia pump, total times 
      and effective times of pressing and analgesic satisfaction rate (P>0.05). After
      laparoscopic radical resection of colon cancer, nalbuphine is effective in PCIA, 
      with low incidence of adverse reactions and high safety.

TI  - Gamified M-Health Attention Bias Modification Intervention for Individuals with
      Opioid Use Disorder: Protocol for a Pilot Randomised Study.
LID - 752
AB  - Introduction: Globally, there is an epidemic of opioid use disorders. Locally, in
      Singapore, there is an increase in the number of individuals abusing opioids. The
      advances in experimental psychology have highlighted the need to modify
      unconscious, automatic biases. These automatic, unconscious biases result in
      individuals having preferential attention to substance-related cues in their
      natural environment, thus leading to a slip or relapse back into their underlying
      addictive disorders. Prior studies have demonstrated not only the presence of
      robust attentional biases amongst individuals with opioid use disorder, even when
      maintained on methadone; and the effectiveness of bias modification amongst these
      individuals. There remains limited evaluation of attention bias modification
      amongst a treatment-seeking cohort of Asian individuals. The objective of this
      pilot is to ensure that the methods of the planned definitive randomized trial
      could be conducted. Methods and Analysis: A non-blinded pilot randomized trial
      will be conducted. A total of 30 participants will be randomized to receive
      either the conventional application or the newly designed co-designed
      application. In order to identify these 30 participants, 60 participants will be 
      recruited and screened to determine if they have baseline biases. Participants
      will be recruited from the inpatient unit at the National Addictions Management
      Service (NAMS) Singapore. All participants who are enrolled into the trial will
      complete a baseline assessment task, and a bias modification assessment and
      modification task daily. They will have to complete a baseline demographic and
      clinical information questionnaire, as well as a cravings rating scale before and
      after the intervention daily. Perspectives—that of self-reported experiences—will
      be sought from the participants following their completion of three intervention 
      tasks. Descriptive statistical analyses will be performed, and chi-square and
      ANOVA analyses will be performed. Qualitative analyses will be undertaken for the
      perspectives shared. Ethics and Dissemination: Ethical approval has been obtained
      from the National Healthcare Group’s Domain Specific Research Board (DSRB)
      (approval number that of 2019/00934). The findings arising from this study will
      be disseminated by means of conferences and publications.

TI  - Effectiveness of supervised early exercise program in patients with arthroscopic 
      rotator cuff repair: Study protocol clinical trial.
LID - e18846
AB  - Background:: Based on the available evidence, it is difficult to make a clinical 
      decision about the best exercise program and to establish the most favorable time
      to start postoperative treatment after rotator cuff (RC) repair. The aim of this 
      trial is to evaluate the effects of adding a supervised early exercise program to
      standard treatment for functional improvement and pain relief compared with
      standard treatment alone in patients with arthroscopic RC repair. Method/design::
      A total of 118 patients between the ages of 18 and 50 years with arthroscopic RC 
      repair will be randomized to 2 treatment arms. The control group will receive a
      standard exercise program based on a consensus statement on shoulder
      rehabilitation developed by the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow
      Therapists. The intervention group will receive a supervised early exercise
      program in combination with standard treatment. This supervised exercise program 
      will be based on electromyographic evidence. Three evaluations will be performed:
      before surgery, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be 
      the shoulder function by the Constant–Murley questionnaire, and the secondary
      outcome measures will be the upper limb function by the disabilities of the arm, 
      shoulder, and hand questionnaire; pain by the visual analog scale; and the
      shoulder range of motion by a goniometer. Discussion:: We hypothesize that
      patients who receive a supervised early exercise program in combination with
      standard treatment will benefit more in respect to shoulder function, pain
      reduction, and range of motion than those who receive a standard exercise
      program. If this is confirmed, our study can be used clinically to enhance the
      recovery of patients with arthroscopic RC repair. Trial registration:: Brazilian 
      registry of clinical trials UTN number U1111-1224-4143. Registered December 18,

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Rimegepant for the Acute Treatment of Migraine: Evidence
      From Randomized Controlled Trials.
LID - 1577
AB  - Background: As one of the novel therapeutic drugs that targets Calcitonin
      gene-related peptide (CGRP), 75 mg rimegepant has been used for the acute
      management of migraine, which is one of the most common neurological diseases
      worldwide. Several clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of rimegepant for the acute management of migraine, but no
      systematic review of existing literature has been performed. We therefore
      performed a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of rimegepant in
      treatment of patients with migraine. Method: Pubmed, Embased, and Cochrane
      Library were searched from January 2001 to August 2019 for randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs). Four RCTs with 3,827 patients were finally included in our study. 
      Result: We pooled 3,827 patients from four RCTs, and the primary endpoints were
      freedom from pain, most bothersome symptom, and pain relief at 2 hr post dose. We
      found that 75 mg rimegepant led to significant freedom from pain (P < 0.001),
      pain relief (P < 0.001), and freedom from the most bothersome symptom (P < 0.001)
      at 2 hr post dose compared with the placebo. In addition, there was no
      statistically significant increase in adverse events compared with the placebo.
      Conclusions: 75 mg rimegepant had good efficacy and safety for acute treatment of
      migraine. Further studies are needed to compare the efficacy of rimegepant with
      traditional drugs for acute management of migraine.

TI  - Regulator of G-Protein Signaling (RGS) Protein Modulation of Opioid Receptor
      Signaling as a Potential Target for Pain Management.
LID - 5
AB  - Opioid drugs are the gold standard for the management of pain, but their use is
      severely limited by dangerous and unpleasant side effects. All clinically
      available opioid analgesics bind to and activate the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), a 
      heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor, to produce analgesia. The activity of 
      these receptors is modulated by a family of intracellular RGS proteins or
      regulators of G-protein signaling proteins, characterized by the presence of a
      conserved RGS Homology (RH) domain. These proteins act as negative regulators of 
      G-protein signaling by serving as GTPase accelerating proteins or GAPS to switch 
      off signaling by both the Gα and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins.
      Consequently, knockdown or knockout of RGS protein activity enhances signaling
      downstream of MOR. In this review we discuss current knowledge of how this
      activity, across the different families of RGS proteins, modulates MOR activity, 
      as well as activity of other members of the opioid receptor family, and so pain
      and analgesia in animal models, with particular emphasis on RGS4 and RGS9
      families. We discuss inhibition of RGS proteins with small molecule inhibitors
      that bind to sensitive cysteine moieties in the RH domain and the potential for
      targeting this family of intracellular proteins as adjuncts to provide an opioid 
      sparing effect or as standalone analgesics by promoting the activity of
      endogenous opioid peptides. Overall, we conclude that RGS proteins may be a novel
      drug target to provide analgesia with reduced opioid-like side effects, but that 
      much basic work is needed to define the roles for specific RGS proteins,
      particularly in chronic pain, as well as a need to develop newer inhibitors.

TI  - Unmet needs of patients with cancer in their last year of life as described by
      caregivers in a developing world setting: a qualitative study.
LID - 13
AB  - Background: Palliative care is in its infancy in most of the developing world. We
      set out to explore the lived experiences of families and caregivers of recently
      deceased cancer patients in Trinidad and Tobago and to determine the unmet needs 
      of the patients and what recommendations could be derived to improve the current 
      services. Methods: A phenomenological approach with purposeful sampling was used.
      Participants were referred by key health professionals. Face-to-face interviews
      were conducted. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, with analysis and data
      collection occurring concurrently. Thematic content analysis was used to
      determine common domains, themes and sub-themes. Results: Interviews were
      completed with 15 caregivers. All were spouses or children of the deceased. Ages 
      of the deceased ranged from 43 to 93, the average being 65.5 years. The deceased 
      experienced a variety of cancers including lung, colorectal and oesophageal.Unmet
      needs were identified under 4 domains of institutions, community, the family unit
      and the wider society. Institutional unmet needs were delayed diagnosis and
      treatment and poor inter-institution coordination. Medical and nursing care
      failed in the areas of health care providers’ attitudes, pain management and
      communication. The family unit lacked physical and psychosocial support for the
      caregiver and financial aid for the family unit. Societal needs were for public
      education to address myths and cultural beliefs around cancer. Conclusion: There 
      is need for systemic interventions to improve the care of those dying from cancer
      in Trinidad and Tobago. Stakeholders need to commit to palliative care as a
      public health priority, implementing education, planning services and mobilizing 
      community resources.

TI  - Characteristics of Patients Referred To A Specialized Headache Clinic.
LID - 1146
AB  - Headache is a common problem with great effect both on the individual and on the 
      society. Recent studies raised the possibility of increasing rate of specialty
      referrals, inappropiate treatment and advanced imaging for simple headache. The
      aim of our study was to analyze the characteritics of patients (including
      duration of symptoms, headache type, brain imaging, treatment) referred to our
      specialized headache clinic between 01/01/2014 and 01/01/2015 by their general
      practitioners and primary care neurologists due to chronic/treatment-resistant
      headache syndromes. 202 patients (mean age 53.6 ± 17.6 years) were evaluated in
      our clinic (102 females, mean age 50.14 ± 16.11 years and 100 males, mean age
      57 ± 18.1 years). Migraine (84/202) and tension-type (76/202) were the most
      common syndromes. 202 plain brain CT, 60 contrast-enhanced CT and 128 MRI were
      carried out by their general practitioners or other healthcare professioners
      including neurologists before referral to our headache centre. Despite of
      extensive brain imaging appropiate treatment was started less than 1/3 of all
      patients and significant proportion received benzodiazepines or opioid therapy.
      Furthermore, more than 10% of referred patients presented with secondary headache
      including one meningitis. The management of headache is still a challenge for
      primary care physicians leading to medical overuse. Vast majority of our patients
      should not be referred to our specialized headache clinic as they had
      uncomplicated headache or other underlying conditions than pain.

TI  - Drivers of the opioid crisis: An appraisal of financial conflicts of interest in 
      clinical practice guideline panels at the peak of opioid prescribing.
LID - e0227045
AB  - Background: Starting in the late 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry sought to
      increase prescribing of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Influencing the
      content of clinical practice guidelines may have been one strategy industry
      employed. In this study we assessed potential risk of bias from financial
      conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry in guidelines for opioid
      prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain published between 2007 and 2013, the peak
      of opioid prescribing. Methods: We used the Guideline Panel Review (GPR) to
      appraise the guidelines included in the 2014 systematic review and critical
      appraisal by Nuckols et al. These were English language opioid prescribing
      guidelines for adults with chronic non-cancer pain published between July 2007
      and July 2013, the peak of opioid prescribing. The GPR assigns red flags to items
      known to introduce potential bias from financial conflicts of interest. We
      operationalized the GPR by creating specific definitions for each red flag. Two
      reviewers independently evaluated each guideline. Disagreements were resolved
      with discussion. We also compared our score to the critical appraisal scores for 
      overall quality from the study by Nuckols et al. Results: We appraised 13
      guidelines, which received 43 red flags in total. Guidelines had 3.3 red flags on
      average (out of a possible seven) with range from one to six. Four guidelines had
      missing information, so red flags may be higher than reported. The guidelines
      with the highest and second highest scores for overall quality in the 2014
      critical appraisal by Nuckols et al. had five and three red flags, respectively. 
      Conclusion: Our findings reveal that the guidelines for opioid prescribing
      chronic non-cancer pain from 2007 to 2013 were at risk of bias because of
      pervasive conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry and a paucity of
      mechanisms to address bias. Even highly-rated guidelines examined in a 2014
      systematic review and critical appraisal had many red flags.

TI  - 1-1-8 one-step sevoflurane wash-in scheme for low-flow anesthesia: simple, rapid,
      and predictable induction.
LID - 23
AB  - Background: Sevoflurane is suitable for low-flow anesthesia (LFA). LFA needs a
      wash-in phase. The reported sevoflurane wash-in schemes lack simplicity, target
      coverage, and applicability. We proposed a one-step 1-1-8 wash-in scheme for
      sevoflurane LFA to be used with both N2O and Air. The objective of our study was 
      to identify time for achieving each level of alveolar concentration of
      sevoflurane (FAS) from 1 to 3.5% in both contexts. Methods: We recruited 199
      adults requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and controlled
      ventilation—102 in group N2O and 97 in group Air. After induction and intubation,
      a wash-in was started using a fresh gas flow of O2:N2O or O2:Air at 1:1 L·min− 1 
      plus sevoflurane 8%. The ventilation was controlled to maintain end-tidal CO2 of 
      30–35 mmHg. Results: The rising patterns of FAS and inspired concentration of
      sevoflurane (FIS) are similar, running parallel between the groups. The FAS/FIS
      ratio increased from 0.46 to 0.72 within 260 s in group N2O and from 0.42 to 0.69
      within 286 s in group Air. The respective time to achieve an FAS of 1, 1.5, 2,
      2.5, 3, and 3.5% was 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 3.5, and 4.5 min in group N2O and 1, 1.5, 2,
      3, 4, and 5 min in group Air. The heart rate and blood pressure of both groups
      significantly increased initially then gradually decreased as FAS increased.
      Conclusions: The 1-1-8 wash-in scheme for sevoflurane LFA has many advantages,
      including simplicity, coverage, swiftness, safety, economy, and that it can be
      used with both N2O and Air. A respective FAS of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5% when 
      used with N2O and Air can be expected at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 3.5, and 4.5 min and 1,
      1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min. Trial registration: This study was retrospectively
      registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03510013) on June 8, 2018.

      disabilities and ADHD.
LID - 212601
AB  - Background: We evaluated Gamalate® B6 (GB6) in patients with borderline
      intellectual functioning (BIF) or mild intellectual development disability (IDD).
      Patients and methods: This was a prospective phase IV observational pilot study
      in 30 patients who underwent neuropsychological evaluation during treatment with 
      GB6 for 12 weeks. Results: In comparison with baseline, the responses were
      positive, with a significant improvement in hyperactivity (51.7%), irritability
      (35.5%), and logorrhea (50%), and no sedative effect. The Clinical Global
      Impressions – Severity (CGI-S) score was much improved or very much improved in
      73% of cases. Reaction time was better with fewer errors, thus indicating an
      improvement in attentional processes. A statistically significant result was
      obtained for the number of movements used to solve the problem and for the total 
      number of correctly solved problems. Conclusion: In this pilot study, GB6 was
      effective and well tolerated in cases of ADHD and challenging behavior in young
      adults with borderline-to-mild BIF/IDD. However, given the small number of
      patients involved and the uncontrolled nature of the study, these results should 
      be viewed cautiously.

TI  - A Novel G Protein-Biased and Subtype-Selective Agonist for a G Protein-Coupled
      Receptor Discovered from Screening Herbal Extracts.
PG  - 213-25
AB  - Subtype selectivity and functional bias are vital in current drug discovery for G
      protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as selective and biased ligands are expected to
      yield drug leads with optimal on-target benefits and minimal side-effects.
      However, structure-based design and medicinal chemistry exploration remain
      challenging in part because of highly conserved binding pockets within
      subfamilies. Herein, we present an affinity mass spectrometry approach for
      screening herbal extracts to identify active ligands of a GPCR, the 5-HT2C
      receptor. Using this method, we discovered a naturally occurring aporphine 1857
      that displayed strong selectivity for activating 5-HT2C without activating the
      5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors. Remarkably, this novel ligand exhibited exclusive
      bias toward G protein signaling for which key residues were identified, and it
      showed comparable in vivo efficacy for food intake suppression and weight loss as
      the antiobesity drug, lorcaserin. Our study establishes an efficient approach to 
      discovering novel GPCR ligands by exploring the largely untapped chemical space
      of natural products.

TI  - Fatal Transdermal Fentanyl Patch Overdose in a Child.
LID - e6755
AB  - A previously healthy three-year-old girl was brought into the emergency
      department by ambulance after being found unresponsive with a family member’s
      fentanyl patch found adherent to her lower back. A head CT scan showed global
      cerebral edema and the patient progressed to brain death. An initial standard
      urine drug screen was negative for opiates, however, subsequent specific urine
      assay testing was found to be positive for fentanyl and norfentanyl. This case
      highlights the dangers of not properly disposing of used fentanyl patches as they
      may still contain enough fentanyl to cause respiratory failure and subsequent
      unintentional death in children. Prescribing physicians and pediatricians should 
      advise care providers that fentanyl patches should be carefully stored,
      monitored, and disposed of properly in order to prevent accidental exposure to
      the pediatric population. Furthermore, synthetic opiates such as fentanyl will
      not read as positive on routine urine drug screens and will require specific
      urine assays.

TI  - Unintentional Drug-related Deaths in Cambridgeshire: A Retrospective
      Observational Study.
LID - e6750
AB  - Background: Drug-related deaths are a growing public health problem in the United
      Kingdom, overtaking road fatalities and homicides in terms of annual deaths. In
      this study, we investigated the causes and circumstances of unintentional
      drug-related deaths occurring in the county of Cambridgeshire, with the objective
      of identifying the prevalence of physical, mental, and social health problems
      within this cohort.Methods: We collected data on the demographics and mental and 
      physical health of, and drugs contributing to, 30 consecutive unintentional
      drug-related deaths recorded by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough County
      Council Coroners in 2017. A retrospective observational study was used, and data 
      were collected by manual extraction from coroners’ files.Results: Social
      isolation was identified as a recurring theme amongst the decedents, although
      homelessness was found in very few cases. Pharmacologically, multiple drug
      toxicity and opioid toxicity were highly prevalent, whilst prescription opioids
      were implicated in more cases than heroin. Chronic pain was also highly prevalent
      amongst the decedents, and a history of mental illness was found to occur in the 
      majority of cases.Discussion: Our findings show that reports from the coronial
      system provide a rich narrative to understand the causes of drug-related deaths. 
      We have identified that individuals who die from drug-related deaths frequently
      have multiple adverse physical, mental, and social problems. This implies that
      any attempt to reduce drug-related deaths requires a multi-faceted and
      multi-disciplinary approach.

TI  - Epilepsy Benchmarks Area IV: Limit or Prevent Adverse Consequence of Seizures and
      Their Treatment Across the Life Span.
PG  - 31S-9S
AB  - Epilepsy represents a complex spectrum disorder, with patients sharing seizures
      as a common symptom and manifesting a broad array of additional clinical
      phenotypes. To understand this disorder and treat individuals who live with
      epilepsy, it is important not only to identify pathogenic mechanisms underlying
      epilepsy but also to understand their relationships with other health-related
      factors. Benchmarks Area IV focuses on the impact of seizures and their treatment
      on quality of life, development, cognitive function, and other aspects and
      comorbidities that often affect individuals with epilepsy. Included in this
      review is a discussion on sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and other causes of
      mortality, a major area of research focus with still many unanswered questions.
      We also draw attention to special populations, such as individuals with
      nonepileptic seizures and pregnant women and their offspring. In this study, we
      review the progress made in these areas since the 2016 review of the Benchmarks
      Area IV and discuss challenges and opportunities for future study.

TI  - Virtual Reality Analgesia With Interactive Eye Tracking During Brief Thermal Pain
      Stimuli: A Randomized Controlled Trial (Crossover Design).
LID - 467
AB  - In light of growing concerns about opioid analgesics, developing new
      non-pharmacologic pain control techniques has become a high priority. Adjunctive 
      virtual reality can help reduce acute pain during painful medical procedures.
      However, for some especially painful medical procedures such as burn wound
      cleaning, clinical researchers recommend that more distracting versions of
      virtual reality are needed, to further amplify the potency of virtual reality
      analgesia. The current study with healthy volunteers explores for the first time 
      whether interacting with virtual objects in Virtual Reality (VR) via “hands free”
      eye-tracking technology integrated into the VR helmet makes VR more
      effective/powerful than non-interactive/passive VR (no eye-tracking) for reducing
      pain during brief thermal pain stimuli.Method: Forty eight healthy volunteers
      participated in the main study. Using a within-subject design, each participant
      received one brief thermal pain stimulus during interactive eye tracked virtual
      reality, and each participant received another thermal pain stimulus during
      non-interactive VR (treatment order randomized). After each pain stimulus,
      participants provided subjective 0–10 ratings of cognitive, sensory and affective
      components of pain, and rated the amount of fun they had during the pain
      stimulus. Results: As predicted, interactive eye tracking increased the analgesic
      effectiveness of immersive virtual reality. Compared to the passive
      non-interactive VR condition, during the interactive eye tracked VR condition,
      participants reported significant reductions in worst pain (p < 0.001) and pain
      unpleasantness (p < 0.001). Participants reported a significantly stronger
      illusion of presence (p < 0.001), and significantly more fun in VR (p < 0.001)
      during the interactive condition compared to during passive VR. In summary, as
      predicted by our primary hypothesis, in the current laboratory acute pain analog 
      study with healthy volunteers, increasing the immersiveness of the VR system via 
      interactive eye tracking significantly increased how effectively VR reduced worst
      pain during a brief thermal pain stimulus. Although attention was not directly
      measured, the pattern of pain ratings, presence ratings, and fun ratings are
      consistent with an attentional mechanism for how VR reduces pain. Whether the
      current results generalize to clinical patient populations is another important
      topic for future research. Additional research and development is recommended.

TI  - Intrathecal Morphine Infusion Therapy via a Percutaneous Port for Refractory
      Cancer Pain in China: An Efficacy, Safety and Cost Utilization Analysis.
PG  - 231-7
AB  - Purpose: Intrathecal morphine infusion therapy via a percutaneous port (IMITPP)
      has been used widely for its relatively low initial cost. However, there is
      scarce knowledge about IMITPP. In this study, we sought to evaluate efficacy,
      complications, and the interval required to achieve the cost equivalence of
      IMITPP in patients with refractory cancer pain in China. Patients and Methods: A 
      retrospective chart review was conducted on cancer patients who had received
      IMITPP at our hospital between April 2017 and April 2019. Data from the numeric
      pain rating scale and Karnofsky performance scores, and complications and costs
      related to IMITPP were collected from medical records. Daily analgesic costs
      before and after IMITPP were calculated based on the doses of opioids on
      admission and at discharge, respectively. The doses of systemic opioids before
      IMITPP were stratified into very high doses [VHD, oral morphine equivalent dose
      (OMED) >599 mg/day], high doses (HD, 300 mg/day ≤ OMED ≤ 599 mg/day), and regular
      doses (RD, OMED < 300 mg/day). Results: Intrathecal morphine infusion therapy via
      a percutaneous port provided significant pain relief, but impaired activities of 
      daily living in patients with refractory cancer pain. The commonly reported
      complications included nausea/vomiting and urinary retention, most of which were 
      managed with symptomatic therapies. The median interval required to achieve cost 
      equivalence was 11.44 months. The median intervals of VHD group and HD group were
      significantly shorter than that of RD group. Conclusion: Intrathecal morphine
      infusion therapy via a percutaneous port provided effective cancer pain
      management without causing serious complications. Patients with higher doses of
      systemic opioids would economically benefit from IMITPP in a shorter time.

TI  - Objective Pain Assessment: a Key for the Management of Chronic Pain.
LID - F1000 Faculty Rev-35
AB  - The individual and social burdens associated with chronic pain have been
      escalating globally. Accurate pain measurement facilitates early diagnosis,
      disease progression monitoring and therapeutic efficacy evaluation, thus is a key
      for the management of chronic pain. Although the “golden standards” of pain
      measurement are self-reported scales in clinical practice, the reliability of
      these subjective methods could be easily affected by patients’ physiological and 
      psychological status, as well as the assessors’ predispositions. Therefore,
      objective pain assessment has attracted substantial attention recently. Previous 
      studies of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed that certain
      cortices and subcortical areas are commonly activated in subjects suffering from 
      pain. Dynamic pain connectome analysis also found various alterations of neural
      network connectivity that are correlated with the severity of clinical pain
      symptoms. Electroencephalograph (EEG) demonstrated suppressed spontaneous
      oscillations during pain experience. Spectral power and coherence analysis of EEG
      also identified signatures of different types of chronic pain. Furthermore, fMRI 
      and EEG can visualize objective brain activities modulated by analgesics in a
      mechanism-based way, thus bridge the gaps between animal studies and clinical
      trials. Using fMRI and EEG, researchers are able to predict therapeutic efficacy 
      and identify personalized optimal first-line regimens. In the future, the
      emergence of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and cell labelling in MRI would
      encourage the investigation on metabolic and cellular pain biomarkers. The
      incorporation of machine learning algorithms with neuroimaging or behavior
      analysis could further enhance the specificity and accuracy of objective pain
      assessments.

TI  - A methodological quality assessment of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
      antidepressants effect on low back pain using updated AMSTAR.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: Antidepressants are prescribed widely to manage low back pain. There 
      are a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses which have investigated the 
      efficacy of the treatments, while the methodological quality of them has not been
      assessed yet. This study aims to evaluate the methodological quality of the
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigating the effect of antidepressants 
      on low back pain. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE,
      Medline, and Cochrane Library databases up to November 2018. The 16-item
      Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR2) scale was used to assess the 
      methodological quality of the studies. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
      the Antidepressants treatment effects on low back pain published in English
      language were included. There was no limitation on the type of Antidepressants
      drugs, clinical setting, and study population, while non-systematical reviews and
      qualitative and narrative reviews were excluded. Results: A total of 25
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses were evaluated; the studies were reported
      between 1992 and 2017. Obtained results from AMSTAR2 showed that 11 (44%), 9
      (36%) and 5 (20%) of the included studies had high, moderate and low qualities,
      respectively. 13(52%) of studies assessed risk of bias and 2(20%) of meta
      analyses considered publication bias. Also, 16 (64%) of the included reviews
      provided a satisfactory explanation for any heterogeneity observed in the
      results. Conclusions: Although the trend of publishing high quality papers in ADs
      effect on LBP increased recently, performing more high-quality SRs and MAs in
      this field with precise subgroups of the type of pains, the class of drugs and
      their dosages may give clear and more reliable evidence to help clinicians and
      policymakers.

      reduced postoperative pain after splenectomy: a randomized trial.
LID - 22
AB  - Background: Splenectomy performed with a curved incision results in severe
      postoperative pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
      transversus abdominis plane block and rectus sheath block on postoperative pain
      relief and recovery. Methods: A total of 150 patients were randomized into the
      control (C), levobupivacaine (L) and levobupivacaine/morphine (LM) groups. The
      patients in the C group received only patient-controlled analgesia. The patients 
      in the L and LM groups received transversus abdominis plane block and rectus
      sheath block with levobupivacaine or levobupivacaine plus morphine. The
      intraoperative opioid consumption; postoperative pain score; time to first
      analgesic use; postoperative recovery data, including the times of first exhaust,
      defecation, oral intake and off-bed activity; the incidence of postoperative
      nausea and vomiting and antiemetics use; and the satisfaction score were
      recorded. Results: Transversus abdominis plane block and rectus sheath block
      reduced intraoperative opioid consumption. The patients in the LM group showed
      lower postoperative pain scores, opioid consumption, postoperative nausea and
      vomiting incidence and antiemetic use and presented shorter recovery times and
      higher satisfaction scores. Conclusions: The combination of transversus abdominis
      plane block and rectus sheath block with levobupivacaine and morphine can improve
      postoperative pain relief, reduce the consumption of analgesics, and partly
      accelerate postoperative recovery. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial

TI  - Heterogeneity in the distribution of 159 drug-response related SNPs in world
      populations and their genetic relatedness.
LID - e0228000
AB  - Interethnic variability in drug response arises from genetic differences
      associated with drug metabolism, action and transport. These genetic variations
      can affect drug efficacy as well as cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We
      retrieved drug-response related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated
      data from databases and analyzed to elucidate population specific distribution of
      159 drug-response related SNPs in twenty six populations belonging to five
      super-populations (African, Admixed Americans, East Asian, European and South
      Asian). Significant interpopulation differences exist in the minor (variant)
      allele frequencies (MAFs), linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype
      distributions among these populations. 65 of the drug-response related alleles,
      which are considered as minor (variant) in global population, are present as the 
      major alleles (frequency ≥0.5) in at least one or more populations. Populations
      that belong to the same super-population have similar distribution pattern for
      majority of the variant alleles. These drug response related variant allele
      frequencies and their pairwise LD measure (r2) can clearly distinguish the
      populations in a way that correspond to the known evolutionary history of human
      and current geographic distributions, while D' cannot. The data presented here
      may aid in identifying drugs that are more appropriate and/or require
      pharmacogenetic testing in these populations. Our findings emphasize on the
      importance of distinct, ethnicity-specific clinical guidelines, especially for
      the African populations, to avoid ADRs and ensure effective drug treatment.

TI  - Persisting Reductions in Cannabis, Opioid, and Stimulant Misuse After
      Naturalistic Psychedelic Use: An Online Survey.
LID - 955
AB  - Background: Observational data and preliminary studies suggest serotonin 2A
      agonist psychedelics may hold potential in treating a variety of substance use
      disorders (SUDs), including opioid use disorder (OUD). Aims: The study aim was to
      describe and analyze self-reported cases in which naturalistic psychedelic use
      was followed by cessation or reduction in other substance use. Methods: An
      anonymous online survey of individuals reporting cessation or reduction in
      cannabis, opioid, or stimulant use following psychedelic use in non-clinical
      settings. Results: Four hundred forty-four respondents, mostly in the USA (67%)
      completed the survey. Participants reported 4.5 years of problematic substance
      use on average before the psychedelic experience to which they attributed a
      reduction in drug consumption, with 79% meeting retrospective criteria for severe
      SUD. Most reported taking a moderate or high dose of LSD (43%) or
      psilocybin-containing mushrooms (29%), followed by significant reduction in drug 
      consumption. Before the psychedelic experience 96% met SUD criteria, whereas only
      27% met SUD criteria afterward. Participants rated their psychedelic experience
      as highly meaningful and insightful, with 28% endorsing psychedelic-associated
      changes in life priorities or values as facilitating reduced substance misuse.
      Greater psychedelic dose, insight, mystical-type effects, and personal meaning of
      experiences were associated with greater reduction in drug consumption.
      Conclusions: While these cross-sectional and self-report methods cannot determine
      whether psychedelics caused changes in drug use, results suggest the potential
      that psychedelics cause reductions in problematic substance use, and support
      additional clinical research on psychedelic-assisted treatment for SUD.

TI  - Optogenetic Activation of β-Endorphin Terminals in the Medial Preoptic Nucleus
      Regulates Female Sexual Receptivity.
LID - ENEURO.0315-19.2019
AB  - Estrogen and progesterone (P4) act in neural circuits to elicit lordosis, the
      stereotypical female sexual receptivity behavior. Estradiol acts through membrane
      receptors to rapidly activate a limbic-hypothalamic circuit consisting of the
      arcuate (ARH), medial preoptic (MPN), and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei of the
      hypothalamus. This initial activation results in a transient but necessary
      inhibition of lordosis, which appears to be a result of the release of
      β-endorphin (β-End) from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) terminals onto cells
      containing the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) in the MPN. To functionally examine the
      role of the MOR in the hypothalamic lordosis circuit, we transfected a
      channelrhodopsin (ChR2) adeno-associated virus into POMC cell bodies in the ARH
      and photostimulated POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN in sexually receptive
      female Pomc-cre mice. Following estrogen and P4 priming, sexual receptivity was
      assessed by measuring the lordosis quotient (LQ). Following an initial trial for 
      sexual receptivity, mice were photostimulated during behavioral testing, and
      brains were processed for MOR immunohistochemistry (IHC). Photostimulation
      decreased the LQ only in ChR2-expressing Pomc-cre mice. Furthermore,
      photostimulation of ChR2 in POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN resulted in the 
      internalization of MOR, indicating activation of the receptor. Our results
      suggest that the activation of the MOR in the MPN is sufficient to attenuate
      lordosis behavior in a hormone-primed, sexually receptive female mouse. These
      data support a central role of MOR in female sexual behavior, and provide further
      insight into the hypothalamus control of sexual receptivity.

TI  - Practices related to assessment of sedation, analgesia and delirium among
      critical care pediatricians in Brazil.
LID - eAO5168
AB  - Objective: To understand the use of tools, protocols and comfort measures related
      to sedation/analgesia, and to screen the occurrence of delirium in pediatric
      intensive care units. Methods: A survey with 14 questions was distributed by
      e-mail to Brazilian critical care pediatricians. Eight questions addressed
      physician and hospital demographics, and six inquired practices to assess
      sedation, analgesia, and delirium in pediatric intensive care units. Results: Of 
      373 questionnaires sent, 61 were answered (16.3%). The majority of physicians
      were practicing in the Southeast region (57.2%). Of these, 46.5% worked at public
      hospitals, 28.6% of which under direct state administration. Of respondents,
      57.1% used formal protocols for sedation and analgesia, and the Ramsay scale was 
      the most frequently employed (52.5%). Delirium screening scores were not used by 
      48.2% of physicians. The Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium was the score
      most often used (23.2%). The majority (85.7%) of physicians did not practice
      daily sedation interruption, and only 23.2% used non-pharmacological measures for
      patient comfort frequently, with varied participation of parents in the process. 
      Conclusion: This study highlights the heterogeneity of practices for assessment
      of sedation/analgesia and lack of detection of delirium among critical care
      pediatricians in Brazil.

TI  - Carbonyl-protein content increases in brain and blood of female rats after
      chronic oxycodone treatment.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: Opioids are the most effective drugs commonly prescribed to treat
      pain. Due to their addictive nature, opioid pain relievers are now second to
      marijuana, ahead of cocaine with respect to dependence. Ours and other studies
      suggest potential toxic effects of chronic opioid administration leading to
      neuronal degeneration. It has been suggested that protein carbonylation may
      represent a sensitive biomarker of cellular degeneration. To evaluate whether
      prolonged oxycodone administration is associated with accumulation of protein
      aggregates that may contribute to neuronal degeneration we measured protein
      carbonylation levels in brain and also in blood plasma of rats after 30-days of
      15 mg/kg daily oxycodone administration. Results: We observed a significant
      increase in the level of carbonylated proteins in rat brain cortex after 30-days 
      of oxycodone treatment compare to that in water treated animals. Also, oxycodone 
      treated rats demonstrated accumulation of insoluble carbonyl-protein aggregates
      in blood plasma. Conclusions: Our data suggests that tests detecting insoluble
      carbonyl-protein aggregates in blood may serve as an inexpensive and minimally
      invasive method to monitor neuronal degeneration in patients with a history of
      chronic opioid use. Such methods could be used to detect toxic side effects of
      other medications and monitor progression of aging and neurodegenerative
      diseases.

      chronic pain mouse model.
LID - 1744806919900717
AB  - Background: Chronic pain is frequently comorbid with anxiety disorder, thereby
      complicating its treatment. Polydatin, a component from the root of Polygonum
      cuspidatum, has shown neuroprotection in the central nervous system. However, its
      effects on pain and anxiety processing have been rarely investigated. In this
      study, mice were injected with complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) at the hindpaw to
      induce pain- and anxiety-like behaviors. Results: Treatment with polydatin
      (25 mg/kg) alleviated the anxiety-like behaviors but not pain perception in these
      mice. Polydatin treatment reversed the upregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid
      receptors and GluA1-containing α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic
      acid receptors in the amygdala of CFA-injected mice. Additionally, this treatment
      reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, namely, tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha and interleukin-1β, in the amygdala. Furthermore, activated nuclear 
      factor kappa-B signaling was blocked in the amygdala from CFA-injected mice. By
      using docking technology, we found potential structural binding between polydatin
      and IκB kinase beta. Conclusion: This study indicates the anxiolytic effects of
      polydatin by suppressing inflammatory cytokines in the amygdala.

TI  - Intrinsic sensory disinhibition contributes to intrusive re-experiencing in
      combat veterans.
LID - 936
AB  - Intrusive re-experiencing of traumatic events is a hallmark symptom of
      posttraumatic stress disorder, characterized by rich and vivid sensory details as
      reported in “flashbacks”. While prevailing models of trauma intrusions focus on
      dysregulated emotional processes, we hypothesize that a deficiency in intrinsic
      sensory inhibition could drive overactivation of sensory representations of
      trauma memories, precipitating sensory-rich intrusions. In a sample of combat
      veterans, we examined resting-state alpha (8–12 Hz) oscillatory activity (in both
      power and posterior→frontal connectivity), given its role in sensory cortical
      inhibition, in association with intrusive re-experiencing symptoms. Veterans
      further participated in an odor task (including both combat and non-combat odors)
      to assess olfactory trauma memory and emotional response. We observed an
      association between intrusive re-experiencing symptoms and attenuated
      resting-state posterior→frontal alpha connectivity, which were both correlated
      with olfactory trauma memory. Importantly, olfactory trauma memory was identified
      as a mediator of the relationship between alpha connectivity and intrusive
      re-experiencing, suggesting that deficits in intrinsic sensory inhibition
      contributed to intrusive re-experiencing of trauma via heightened trauma memory. 
      Therefore, by permitting unfiltered sensory cues to enter information processing 
      and activate sensory representations of trauma, sensory disinhibition can
      constitute a sensory mechanism of intrusive re-experiencing in trauma-exposed
      individuals.

LID - 6
AB  - So far, opioids have been successfully used to reduce cancer pain in patients in 
      order to improve their quality of life. However, the use of opioids leads to
      numerous side effects such as constipation, drowsiness, nausea, itching,
      increased sweating and hormonal changes. In this review, we described the action 
      of opioids in several molecular pathways significant for maintenance of the
      intestinal homeostasis including the impact on the intestinal epithelium
      integrity, changes in microbiome composition, modulation of the immune system or 
      induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. We summed up the role of
      individual opioids in the processes involved in the growth and development of
      cancer and elucidated if targeting opioid receptors may constitute novel
      therapeutic option in colon cancer.

TI  - Interactive group-based orientation sessions: A method to improve adherence and
      retention in pragmatic clinical trials.
LID - 100527
AB  - Background: Intervention adherence and trial retention are challenging for
      clinical trials testing intensive behavioral interventions. Operational
      constraints or trial designs may preclude using effective retention strategies
      such as financial incentives. We examined whether implementing pre-enrollment
      orientation sessions was associated with higher intervention adherence and
      retention in a pragmatic clinical trial. Methods: The trial tested an intensive
      behavioral intervention for patients with chronic pain on long-term opioids.
      Orientation sessions were implemented two years into trial recruitment at one
      site. Held before informed consent and randomization, these mandatory,
      group-based orientation sessions provided trial specifics, explained research
      methods principles, and leveraged motivational interviewing techniques. Using a
      pre-post design and multivariate models, we assessed adherence (number of
      intervention meetings attended) and retention (completed quarterly pain
      assessments over 12 months) before (04/2014–12/2015; n = 209) and after
      (01/2016–02/2017; n = 258) implementation. Also, we evaluated whether session
      implementation affected the proportion and characteristics of enrolled patients. 
      Results: After implementing orientation sessions, patients had higher
      intervention adherence than before (M = 7.6, SD = 3.8 vs. M = 5.6, SD = 4.5,
      respectively; mean difference = 2.0, 95% CI [0.9, 3.2], p = .001), and 2.8 times 
      greater odds of completing quarterly assessments (95% CI [1.3, 5.8], p = .007).
      Fewer patients enrolled after implementing sessions than before (38.1% vs. 70.8%,
      95% CI [26.4, 39.1], p < .001), with no differences in patient characteristics.
      Conclusions: Implementing orientation sessions during recruitment may be useful
      for promoting trial adherence and retention. To ensure enrollment goals are met, 
      target population size and barriers affecting patients’ ability to attend
      orientation sessions should be considered, especially for patients with complex
      medical conditions. Clinical trials registration number: NCT02113592.

TI  - Direct Anterior Approach Versus Posterolateral Approach for Hemiarthroplasty in
      the Treatment of Displaced Femoral Neck Fractures in Geriatric Patients.
PG  - e919993-1-8
AB  - Background: In the present study, we aimed to evaluate early clinical and
      biochemical outcomes of direct anterior approach (DAA) versus posterolateral
      approach (PLA) for hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of displaced femoral neck
      fractures in geriatric patients. Material/Methods: Between September 2012 and
      September 2017, a total of 110 patients who underwent hemiarthroplasty for
      displaced femoral neck fractures were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were
      divided into 2 groups according to the surgical technique PLA (Group 1, n=54) and
      DAA (Group 2, n=56). Clinical and biochemical results were compared. Results:
      There was no significant difference in the demographic characteristics of the
      patients, fixation type, and follow-up (P>0.05). However, there was a significant
      difference in the duration of surgery, amount of blood transfusion, change from
      baseline in postoperative hemoglobin levels, amount of intraoperative gauze
      dressing, amount of drainage fluid from the surgical wound, postoperative VAS
      scores, incision length, length of hospital stay, and Barthel Index scores in
      favor of DAA group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the degree of
      mobilization (P>0.05). None of the patients had postoperative complications in
      Group 1, while 3 patients in Group 2 developed a lateral femoral cutaneous nerve 
      lesion and one patient had a missed iatrogenic fracture of the greater
      trochanter. Conclusions: Our study results suggest that early clinical and
      biochemical outcomes are better in DAA than PLA with early return to daily living
      activities in patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty for displaced femoral neck
      fractures.

TI  - Therapeutic Use of LSD in Psychiatry: A Systematic Review of
      Randomized-Controlled Clinical Trials.
LID - 943
AB  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was studied from the 1950s to the 1970s to
      evaluate behavioral and personality changes, as well as remission of psychiatric 
      symptoms in various disorders. LSD was used in the treatment of anxiety,
      depression, psychosomatic diseases and addiction. However, most of the studies
      were not performed under contemporary standards, and it has taken several decades
      for a resurgence of interest in LSD research and its therapeutic potential for
      psychiatry. The aim of this review is to identify controlled and randomized
      clinical trials that assess the potential use of LSD in psychiatry. PRISMA
      guidelines for systematic review were followed. A literature search of PubMed and
      Psychedelic bibliography from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic
      Studies (MAPS) databases was performed as well as a manual search of references
      from evaluated studies. Only randomized-controlled clinical trials were included.
      Study quality was systematically calculated by using the Cochrane Collaboration
      Tool for assessing risk of bias. A final selection of 11 articles was made after 
      considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. LSD was administered to 567
      patients in a dose ranging from 20 to 800 mcg. Despite the design heterogeneity
      of clinical trials, positive results were observed, thus revealing the
      therapeutic potential of LSD to reduce psychiatric symptomatology, mainly in
      alcoholism. The vast majority of authors describe significant and positive
      short-term changes in patients, despite the fact that in some studies an
      important homogenization was observed between the LSD treatment group and control
      group at long-term follow-up. Multiple variables regarding LSD treatment
      therapeutic approach and quality of experience were revealed and related to
      therapeutic outcomes. LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in
      psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment
      of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing proper double blind clinical
      trials with this substance, new studies that conform to modern standards are
      necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge on its use and open new doors in
      the future.

TI  - Coughing in Small Animal Patients.
LID - 513
AB  - Cough is one of the most common complaints in human medicine. In veterinary
      medicine cough is equally frequent and plays a significant role in an owner's
      perception of their pet's quality of life. In human and veterinary medicine,
      therapy for chronic cough is often ineffective. The complexity of the cough
      pathway and species differences have made it difficult to develop an effective
      antitussive agent for veterinary patients. The few effective antitussive agents
      currently available are associated with significant adverse effects. Fortunately,
      several promising drugs currently being studied in human clinical trials may
      offer options for use of novel antitussive therapies in small animal patients.
      This article reviews current understanding about cough pathophysiology,
      diagnostic strategies used to uncover underlying etiology of cough, and examines 
      available options for controlling cough, including novel antitussive therapies
      used in human medicine.

TI  - Safety, Tolerability, and Effect on Opioid Use of Meloxicam IV Following
      Orthopedic Surgery.
PG  - 221-9
AB  - Objective: A Phase 3 randomized multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial (NCT02720692) compared once-daily intravenous (IV) meloxicam 30 mg to
      placebo, when added to the standard of care pain management regimens, in adults
      with moderate-to-severe pain following major elective surgery and concluded that 
      meloxicam IV had a safety profile similar to placebo and reduced opioid
      consumption. Methods: In this post hoc subgroup analysis of orthopedic surgery
      subjects, 379 subjects received meloxicam IV 30 mg or IV-administered placebo
      every 24 hrs for ≤7 doses. Safety was assessed via AEs, laboratory tests, vital
      signs, and ECG, with an emphasis on specific AEs, including injection site
      reactions, bleeding, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, thrombotic, and wound
      healing events. Daily opioid consumption was assessed during treatment. Results: 
      Among meloxicam IV-treated subjects, 64.7% experienced ≥1 AE versus 68.8% of
      placebo-treated subjects. Investigators assessed most AEs to be mild or moderate 
      in intensity and unrelated to treatment. Total opioid consumption (36.8 mg versus
      50.3 mg IV morphine equivalent dose; P=0.0081) and opioid consumption during time
      points 0‒24, 24‒48, 0‒48, and 0‒72 hrs were statistically significantly lower in 
      the meloxicam IV group. Conclusion: Meloxicam IV demonstrated no significant
      differences in the number and frequency of AEs versus placebo in subjects
      following orthopedic surgery. Opioid consumption was reduced in the meloxicam IV 
      group versus placebo. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier:
      NCT02720692).

TI  - Prostanoid receptor genes confer poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma via epigenetic inactivation.
LID - 31
AB  - Background: Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC) and other diseases. Prostanoid receptors are clearly involved
      in the development of many types of cancer. However, their role is not simple and
      is poorly understood in HNSCC. Methods: Methylation profiles of prostanoid
      receptor family genes were generated for tumour samples obtained from 274
      patients with HNSCC, including 69 hypopharynx, 51 larynx, 79 oral cavity, and 75 
      oropharynx tumour samples, by quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Promoter
      methylation was then evaluated with respect to various clinical characteristics
      and patient survival. Results: The mean number of methylated genes per sample was
      2.05 ± 2.59 (range 0 to 9). Promoters of PTGDR1, PTGDR2, PTGER1, PTGER2, PTGER3, 
      PTGER4, PTGFR, PTGIR, and TBXA2R were methylated in 43.8%, 18.2%, 25.5%, 17.5%,
      41.2%, 8.0%, 19.3%, 20.4%, and 11.3% of the samples, respectively. Methylation
      indices for prostanoid receptor family genes tended to be higher as the number of
      TET methylation events increased. Patients with 5–9 methylated genes had a
      significantly lower survival rate than that of patients with 0–4 methylated genes
      (log-rank test, P= 0.007). In multivariate analyses, PTGDR1 methylation was most 
      highly correlated with recurrence in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer
      (P = 0.014). A similar correlation was observed for PTGER4 in patients with
      laryngeal cancer (P = 0.046). Methylation of the PTGIR and TBXA2R promoters was
      positively correlated with recurrence in oropharyngeal cancer (P = 0.028 and
      P = 0.006, respectively). Moreover, Patients with 5–9 methylated genes were
      extremely lower of 5hmC levels (P = 0.035) and was correlated with increasing
      expression of DNMT3A and DNMT3B (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively).
      Conclusion: We characterised the relationship between the methylation status of
      prostanoid receptor genes and recurrence in HNSCC. These results provide new
      perspectives for the development of molecular targeted treatment approaches.

      infection-induced chronic pain conditions.
LID - 1744806919900725
AB  - Infection-induced chronic pain is an under-studied pain condition. One example is
      apical periodontitis, which evokes considerable mechanical allodynia that
      persists after treatment in 7% to 12% of patients. Available analgesics often
      provide incomplete relief. However, a preclinical model to study pain mechanisms 
      associated with apical periodontitis is not available. Here, we report a mouse
      model of apical periodontitis to facilitate studies determining mechanisms
      mediating persistent infection-induced pain. Mice were anesthetized and the left 
      first molar was exposed to the oral environment for six weeks. Bone resorption,
      as an indicator of apical periodontitis, was quantified using microcomputed
      tomography. Mechanical allodynia was determined using extraoral von-Frey
      filaments in both male and female mice. The expression of c-fos in the medullary 
      dorsal horn was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Mice with apical
      periodontitis developed significant mechanical allodynia by day 7 that was
      maintained for 42 days. Mechanical thresholds were significantly lower in females
      compared to males. Administration of ibuprofen, morphine, or MK-801 reversed
      mechanical allodynia. Finally, apical periodontitis triggered an upregulation of 
      c-fos in the medullary dorsal horn. Collectively, this model simulates signs of
      clinical pain experienced by patients with apical periodontitis, detects sex
      differences in allodynia, and permits the study of peripheral and central
      trigeminal pain mechanisms.

LID - 1744806920902350
AB  - Pain is known to disrupt sleep patterns, and disturbances in sleep can further
      worsen pain symptoms. Sleep spindles occur during slow wave sleep and have
      established effects on sensory and affective processing in mammals. A number of
      chronic neuropsychiatric conditions, meanwhile, are known to alter sleep spindle 
      density. The effect of persistent pain on sleep spindle waves, however, remains
      unknown, and studies of sleep spindles are challenging due to long period of
      monitoring and data analysis. Utilizing automated sleep spindle detection
      algorithms built on deep learning, we can monitor the effect of pain states on
      sleep spindle activity. In this study, we show that in a chronic pain model in
      rodents, there is a significant decrease in sleep spindle activity compared to
      controls. Meanwhile, methods to restore sleep spindles are associated with
      decreased pain symptoms. These results suggest that sleep spindle density
      correlates with chronic pain and may be both a potential biomarker for chronic
      pain and a target for neuromodulation therapy.

LID - 2055207619901085
AB  - Objective: Social network platforms are increasingly used in digital health
      research. Our study aimed to 1. qualify and quantify the use of social media
      platforms in health research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
      and document changes occurring between 2011 and 2017 and 2. examine whether
      institutions hosting these studies provided public-facing guidelines on how to
      conduct ethical social media health research. Methods: The NIH RePORTER (Research
      Portfolio Online Reporting Tools) database was searched to identify research
      utilizing Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, or Twitter. Studies included used
      social media for observational research, recruitment, intervention delivery or to
      assess social media as an effective research tool. Abstracts were qualitatively
      analyzed to describe the population and health topic by year. Websites of
      organizations receiving funding for this research were searched to identify
      whether guidance or policy existed. Results: Studies (n = 105) were organized by 
      population targeted and health focus. Main “Health” themes were labeled: 1.
      substance use, 2. disease/diagnosis, 3. psychiatry/mental health, and 4. weight
      and physical activity. The populations most involved included adolescents and
      young adults, and men who have sex with men. The number of research studies using
      social media increased approximately 590% between 2011 and 2017. Studies were
      linked to 56 organizations of which 21% (n = 12) provided some accessible
      guidance with 79% (n = 44) offering no guidance specific to social media health
      research. Conclusions: Social media research is conducted with vulnerable
      populations that are traditionally difficult to reach. There is a compelling need
      for resources designed to support ethical and responsible social media-enabled
      research to enable this research to be carried out safely.

TI  - Interventions for incarcerated adults with opioid use disorder in the United
      States: A systematic review with a focus on social determinants of health.
LID - e0227968
AB  - Incarceration poses significant health risks for people involved in the criminal 
      justice system. As the world’s leader in incarceration, the United States
      incarcerated population is at higher risk for infectious diseases, mental
      illness, and substance use disorder. Previous studies indicate that the mortality
      rate for people coming out of prison is almost 13 times higher than that of the
      general population; opioids contribute to nearly 1 in 8 post-release fatalities
      overall, and almost half of all overdose deaths. Given the hazardous intersection
      of incarceration, opioid use disorder, and social determinants of health, we
      systematically reviewed recent evidence on interventions for opioid use disorder 
      (OUD) implemented as part of United States criminal justice system involvement,
      with an emphasis on social determinants of health (SDOH). We searched academic
      literature to identify eligible studies of an intervention for OUD that was
      implemented in the context of criminal justice system involvement (e.g.,
      incarceration or parole/probation) for adults ages 19 and older. From 6,604
      citations, 13 publications were included in final synthesis. Most interventions
      were implemented in prisons (n = 6 interventions), used medication interventions 
      (n = 10), and did not include SDOH as part of the study design (n = 8).
      Interventions that initiated medication treatment early and throughout
      incarceration had significant, positive effects on opioid use outcomes. Evidence 
      supports medication treatment administered throughout the period of criminal
      justice involvement as an effective method of improving post-release outcomes in 
      individuals with criminal justice involvement. While few studies included SDOH
      components, many investigators recognized SDOH needs as competing priorities
      among justice-involved individuals. This review suggests an evidence gap;
      evidence-based interventions that address OUD and SDOH in the context of criminal
      justice involvement are urgently needed.

TI  - Expression of feeding-related neuromodulatory signalling molecules in the mouse
      central olfactory system.
LID - 890
AB  - Various neural systems cooperate in feeding behaviour, and olfaction plays
      crucial roles in detecting and evaluating food objects. While odour-mediated
      feeding behaviour is highly adaptive and influenced by metabolic state, hedonic
      cues and learning processes, the underlying mechanism is not well understood.
      Feeding behaviour is regulated by orexigenic and anorexigenic neuromodulatory
      molecules. However, knowledge of their roles especially in higher olfactory areas
      is limited. Given the potentiation of feeding behaviour in hunger state, we
      systemically examined the expression of feeding-related neuromodulatory molecules
      in food-restricted mice through quantitative PCR, in the olfactory bulb (OB),
      olfactory tubercle (OT), and remaining olfactory cortical area (OC). The OT was
      further divided into attraction-related anteromedial, aversion-related lateral
      and remaining central regions. Examination of 23 molecules including
      neuropeptides, opioids, cannabinoids, and their receptors as well as signalling
      molecules showed that they had different expression patterns, with many showing
      elevated expression in the OT, especially in the anteromedial and central OT.
      Further, in mice trained with odour-food association, the expression was
      significantly altered and the increase or decrease of a given molecule varied
      among areas. These results suggest that different olfactory areas are regulated
      separately by feeding-related molecules, which contributes to the adaptive
      regulation of feeding behaviour.

TI  - The Role of Peripheral Opioid Receptors in Triggering Heroin-induced Brain
      Hypoxia.
LID - 833
AB  - While it is known that opioid receptors (ORs) are densely expressed in both the
      brain and periphery, it is widely accepted that hypoxic effects of opioids result
      solely from their direct action in the CNS. To examine the role of peripheral ORs
      in triggering brain hypoxia, we used oxygen sensors in freely moving rats to
      examine how naloxone-HCl and naloxone-methiodide, the latter which is commonly
      believed to be peripherally restricted, affect brain oxygen responses induced by 
      intravenous heroin at low, human-relevant doses. Similar to naloxone-HCl,
      naloxone-methiodide at a relatively low dose (2 mg/kg) fully blocked
      heroin-induced decreases in brain oxygen levels. As measured by mass
      spectrometry, naloxone-methiodide was found to be ~40-fold less permeable than
      naloxone-HCl across the blood-brain barrier, thus acting as a selective blocker
      of peripheral ORs. Despite this selectivity, a low but detectable amount of
      naloxone was found in brain tissue after naloxone-methiodide administration,
      potentially influencing our results. Therefore, we examined the effects of
      naloxone-methiodide at a very low dose (0.2 mg/kg; at which naloxone was
      undetectable in brain tissue) and found that this drug still powerfully
      attenuates heroin-induced brain oxygen responses. These data demonstrate the role
      of peripheral ORs in triggering heroin-induced respiratory depression and
      subsequent brain hypoxia.

TI  - Integrated miRNA-/mRNA-Seq of the Habenulo-Interpeduncular Circuit During Acute
      Nicotine Withdrawal.
LID - 813
AB  - Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of mortality in the world. The
      limited number of smoking cessation aids currently available are minimally
      effective, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic interventions. We describe
      a genome-wide approach to identify potential candidates for such interventions.
      Next-generation sequencing was performed using RNA isolated from the
      habenulo-interpeduncular circuit of male mice withdrawn from chronic nicotine
      treatment. This circuit plays a central role in the nicotine withdrawal response.
      Differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs were validated using RT-qPCR. Many of
      the differentially expressed mRNAs are predicted targets of reciprocally
      expressed miRNAs. We illustrate the utility of the dataset by demonstrating that 
      knockdown in the interpeduncular nucleus of a differentially expressed mRNA, that
      encoding profilin 2, is sufficient to induce anxiety-related behavior.
      Importantly, profilin 2 knockdown in the ventral tegmental area did not affect
      anxiety behavior. Our data reveal wide-spread changes in gene expression within
      the habenulo-interpeduncular circuit during nicotine withdrawal. This dataset
      should prove to be a valuable resource leading to the identification of
      substrates for the design of innovative smoking cessation aids.

      thoracoscopic surgery: A retrospective study.
LID - 795
AB  - Moderate-severe pain after surgical procedures is associated with decreased
      quality of life and increased costs. This study aimed to identify the incidence
      and predictive factors of moderate-severe postoperative pain within 48 hours
      following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) in a tertiary hospital. A
      retrospective cohort analysis was performed using medical records of adult
      patients who underwent VATS between January 2015 and December 2016. Logistic
      regression was performed to identify predictive factors for moderate-severe pain 
      (visual analogue scale, VAS ≥ 4) within 24 hours and within 48 hours
      postoperatively. Of the 1164 participants, the incidence of moderate-severe pain 
      was 12.7% within the first 24 hours and 15.6% within the first 48 hours after
      surgery. In multivariable analysis, the independent risk factors related to
      moderate-severe pain within 24 hours after surgery were younger age, increased
      body mass index, preoperative pain within 1 month and history of smoking. The
      risk factors for moderate-severe acute pain within 48 hours were almost the same,
      except that the number of chest tubes were also included. Moderate-severe
      postoperative pain following VATS is not rare, and presence of several risk
      factors deserves more aggressive pain management strategies perioperatively.

TI  - Rapid recovery following hip and knee arthroplasty using local infiltration
      analgesia: length of stay, rehabilitation protocol and cost savings.
PG  - 355-9
AB  - Background: We implemented local infiltration analgesia (LIA) as a technique of
      providing post‐operative pain management and early mobilization after
      arthroplasty surgery and have progressively found patients able to go home
      earlier. This study compares the national data on hip and knee arthroplasty
      provided by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and Medibank Private with 
      our outcomes using LIA and rapid recovery. Methods: Prospective study of one
      surgeon including 200 knees, and 165 hips in the two years till June 2016.
      Variables included in comparison to the two groups were: length of stay,
      percentage of patients transferred to rehabilitation or intensive care unit
      (ICU), readmitted within 30 days and average separation cost. Results: Hip
      replacement median length of stay in our series was two nights versus five
      nights, inpatient rehabilitation 7% versus 36%, ICU admission zero versus 4%, and
      readmissions 3.9% versus 6.0%, the average hospital separation cost in our series
      was $17 813 versus $26 734. Knee replacement median length of stay in our study
      was one night versus five nights, ICU 0.5% versus 3%, rehabilitation 4.5% versus 
      43%, and readmission 6% versus 7%, the average hospital separation cost in our
      group was $16 437 versus $27 505. Conclusion: The comprehensive approach of LIA
      and rapid recovery enables patients to have shorter hospitalization, lower
      rehabilitation incidence and a resultant reduction in health expenditure.

TI  - Pain assessment and management: An audit of practice at a tertiary hospital.
LID - 1281
AB  - Background: In spite of advances in techniques and analgesics for pain
      management, pain remains a major health problem. Regular assessment and
      reassessment of pain using guidelines with measurable goals is essential for
      effective pain management in surgical wards. Unfortunately, no such guidelines
      exist in South Africa. To implement appropriate precepts for the South African
      context, the current practice must be understood. Aim: The aim of this article
      was to evaluate pain assessment and management of patients in two surgical wards 
      at a tertiary hospital in South Africa. Setting: The study was conducted within
      the Western Cape Province of South Africa in a government-funded tertiary
      academic institution. The patients at this hospital are generally from the
      low-income strata and live in resource-poor communities. Methods: A
      cross-sectional, retrospective medical record audit was conducted. The folders of
      all 215 patients admitted to a specific orthopaedic trauma and urogynaecological 
      ward of a tertiary hospital in South Africa over a span of 1 month were targeted 
      for review. Medical folders that were not available or had missing notes were
      excluded. Variables evaluated included the number of pain assessments recorded,
      pain assessor, assessment tool and management plan. Results: A total of 168
      folders were available for review. Nearly half of the patients had no documented 
      pain assessment. The Verbal Rating Scale was the predominant tool used, and
      assessments were mostly conducted by the ward doctor. Pain interventions appeared
      to be primarily based on the professional knowledge of the practitioner and were 
      not evidence-based. Conclusion: Pain assessment and management was a problem in
      the two wards reviewed, which is similar to the findings from studies referenced 
      in this text. Health professionals must be empowered to manage pain adequately.
      An assessment tool that integrates the biopsychosocial factors that influence the
      pain experience should be routinely employed by a multidisciplinary team to
      facilitate goal-directed therapy.

TI  - Epidemiology of knee osteoarthritis in general practice: a registry-based study.
LID - e031734
AB  - Objectives: The present study investigated (1) trends in the prevalence and
      incidence of knee osteoarthritis over a 20-year period (1996–2015); (2) trends in
      multimorbidity and (3) trends in drug prescriptions. Design: Registry-based
      study. Setting: Primary healthcare, Flanders, Belgium. Participants: Data were
      collected from Intego, a general practice-based morbidity registration network.
      In the study period between 1996 and 2015, data from 440 140 unique patients were
      available. Outcome measures: Trends in prevalence and incidence rate of knee
      osteoarthritis were computed using joinpoint regression analysis. The mean
      disease count was calculated to assess trends in multimorbidity. In addition, the
      number of drug prescriptions was identified by the Anatomical Therapeutic
      Chemical Classification code and trends were equally recorded with joinpoint
      regression. Results: The total age-standardised prevalence of knee osteoarthritis
      increased from 2.0% in 1996 to 3.6% in 2015. An upward trend was observed with an
      average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 2.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 2.9). In 2015, the 
      prevalence rates in the 10 year age groups from the 45–54 years age group onwards
      were 3.1%, 5.6%, 9.0% and 13.9%, to reach 15.0% in people aged 85 years and
      older. The incidence remained stable with 3.75‰ in 2015 (AAPC=−0.5, 95% CI −1.4
      to 0.5). The mean disease count significantly increased from 1.63 to 2.34
      (p<0.001) for incident cases with knee osteoarthritis. Finally, we observed a
      significantly positive trend in the overall prescription of acetaminophen
      (AAPC=6.7, 95% CI 5.6 to 7.7), weak opioids (AAPC=4.0, 95% CI 0.9 to 7.3) and
      glucosamine (AAPC=8.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 15.1). Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs were most prescribed, with a prevalence rate of 29.8% in 2015, but remained
      stable during the study period (AAPC=0.0, 95% CI −1.1 to 1.1). Conclusions:
      Increased prevalence, multimorbidity, and number of drug prescriptions confirm an
      increased burden of knee osteoarthritis. In future, these trends can be used to
      prioritise initiatives for improvement in care.

TI  - Diagnosis of Acute Mesenteric Ischemia in a Patient with End-Stage Renal Disease 
      with Normal Serum Lactate.
LID - e6708
AB  - Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening vascular emergency and a
      diagnostic challenge for physicians. It represents a group of pathophysiologic
      processes that have a common end point, that is, bowel infarction, and has a
      nonspecific clinical picture and a high mortality rate. The most common
      underlying etiologies are arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, nonocclusive
      mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), and mesenteric venous thrombosis. NOMI is caused by
      prolonged functional vasoconstriction of the visceral arterial vessels, leading
      to progressive intestinal ischemia, and could be defined by the absence of
      atherosclerotic thrombotic or embolic occlusion of the mesenteric arteries. The
      pathophysiology of NOMI remains poorly understood. It can occur in a wide range
      of critical systemic illnesses associated with hypotension and hypovolemia and in
      patients on hemodialysis. Elevation of serum lactate may not be present in a
      significant portion of patients with AMI, which creates an additional obstacle to
      the prompt diagnosis and often delays treatment. We present a case of a
      35-year-old female with HIV and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who was
      admitted for complaints of vague nonspecific abdominal pain. Her initial lactic
      acid was normal, and due to renal function, she underwent CT of the chest and
      abdomen without contrast, which only revealed findings consistent with chronic
      constipation. She later developed vasopressor-dependent hypotension, but her
      serial lactic acids were all normal. Finally, CT of the abdomen and pelvis was
      performed with IV contrast, with findings of enterocolitis of the ileum and
      proximal ascending colon. There was also evidence of pneumatosis involving
      dilated loops of the small bowel in the lateral mid-abdomen. She underwent an
      exploratory laparotomy and was found to have gangrene of terminal ileum with
      associated perforation. Small bowel resection was performed, after which the
      patient clinically stabilized.

TI  - Allosteric Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1) Ligands Reduce Ocular Pain and
      Inflammation.
LID - 417
AB  - Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) activation has been reported to reduce transient
      receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1)-induced
      inflammatory responses and is anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory in corneal
      injury. We examined whether allosteric ligands, can modulate CB1 signaling to
      reduce pain and inflammation in corneal hyperalgesia. Corneal hyperalgesia was
      generated by chemical cauterization of cornea in wildtype and CB2 knockout
      (CB2−/−) mice. The novel racemic CB1 allosteric ligand GAT211 and its enantiomers
      GAT228 and GAT229 were examined alone or in combination with the orthosteric CB1 
      agonist Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC). Pain responses were assessed following 
      capsaicin (1 µM) stimulation of injured corneas at 6 h post-cauterization.
      Corneal neutrophil infiltration was also analyzed. GAT228, but not GAT229 or
      GAT211, reduced pain scores in response to capsaicin stimulation. Combination
      treatments of 0.5% GAT229 or 1% GAT211 with subthreshold Δ8-THC (0.4%)
      significantly reduced pain scores following capsaicin stimulation. The
      anti-nociceptive effects of both GAT229 and GAT228 were blocked with CB1
      antagonist AM251, but remained unaffected in CB2−/− mice. Two percent GAT228, or 
      the combination of 0.2% Δ8-THC with 0.5% GAT229 also significantly reduced
      corneal inflammation. CB1 allosteric ligands could offer a novel approach for
      treating corneal pain and inflammation.

TI  - New drugs are not enough-drug repositioning in oncology: An update.
PG  - 651-84
AB  - Drug repositioning refers to the concept of discovering novel clinical benefits
      of drugs that are already known for use treating other diseases. The advantages
      of this are that several important drug characteristics are already established
      (including efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity), making the
      process of research for a putative drug quicker and less costly. Drug
      repositioning in oncology has received extensive focus. The present review
      summarizes the most prominent examples of drug repositioning for the treatment of
      cancer, taking into consideration their primary use, proposed anticancer
      mechanisms and current development status.

TI  - Comparing the prophylactic effects of oral gabapentin, pregabalin, and celecoxib 
      on postoperative pain management in orthopedic surgery of the lower extremity: A 
      double-blind randomized controlled trial.
LID - 9
AB  - Background:: Lower extremity pain after orthopedic surgery is so frequent that
      has led to many treatment modalities. This study aims to compare the prophylactic
      effects of oral gabapentin, pregabalin, and celecoxib on reducing postsurgical
      pain of the lower extremity orthopedic surgery. Materials and Methods:: In a
      double-blind randomized controlled trial, 120 patients were randomly divided into
      four groups using block design randomization. 1 h before spinal anesthesia, the
      studied groups received 300 mg oral gabapentin; 75 mg oral pregabalin; 200 mg
      oral celecoxib; and starch as placebo. The severity of postoperative pain (using 
      visual analog scale), mean arterial pressure, heart rate, opioid consumption
      dose, and drug side effects were recorded for six times (each 60 min up to two
      times and then every 6 h for the next four times). Chi-square, one-way analysis
      of variance (ANOVA), and ANOVA repeated measure tests were used for statistical
      analysis. Results:: Significant reduction of pain severity was observed only at
      the first time measurement between pregabalin and placebo groups (P: 0.014).
      Patients in the pregabalin group required lower dose of opioid compared to
      placebo group during admission in surgical ward. There were no significant
      differences concerning pain reduction, opioid administration, and side effects
      between pregabalin, gabapentin, and celecoxib groups. Conclusion:: Taking 75 mg
      oral pregabalin before lower extremity orthopedic surgery can attenuate
      postoperative pain, especially during the 1st h postoperation as well as less
      opioid consumption and much more patients' satisfaction.

TI  - Relationship Between Pain Reduction and Improvement in Health-Related Quality of 
      Life in Patients with Knee Pain Due to Osteoarthritis Receiving Duloxetine:
      Exploratory Post Hoc Analysis of a Japanese Phase 3 Randomized Study.
PG  - 181-91
AB  - Purpose: This post hoc analysis of a Japanese phase 3 randomized study
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02248480) investigated relationships between
      changes in pain severity and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in
      duloxetine-treated patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Patients and Methods: 
      Patients with knee OA and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) average pain score ≥4
      received duloxetine 60 mg/day or placebo for 14 weeks. Spearman rank correlation 
      coefficients were calculated for change in pain severity, as assessed by the BPI,
      and change in HRQoL, as assessed by the items of the (i) 36-item Short-Form
      Health Survey (SF-36; a generic measure of HRQoL) and (ii) Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC; an OA-specific measure of
      HRQoL). Results: After 14 weeks of treatment, there was a significantly greater
      improvement (p<0.001) for duloxetine (n=177) vs placebo (n=176) in BPI average
      pain severity score and significantly greater improvements (p<0.01) for
      duloxetine vs placebo for 5 of the 8 SF-36 domains (including the Role-Physical, 
      Bodily Pain, and Physical Functioning domains) and all 24 individual WOMAC items.
      The correlation between BPI change from baseline and SF-36 item change from
      baseline was statistically significant (p<0.05) for 2 of the 8 SF-36 items
      (Bodily Pain, Physical Functioning) in duloxetine-treated patients. The
      correlation between BPI change from baseline and WOMAC item change from baseline 
      was statistically significant for 22 of the 24 WOMAC items in duloxetine-treated 
      patients. Conclusion: This post hoc analysis suggested that the pain reduction
      observed in duloxetine-treated patients with knee OA was associated with
      improvements in OA-specific aspects of HRQoL, ie, pain and physical functioning.

TI  - MicroRNA-802 Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis in Human Laryngeal
      Cancer by Targeting cAMP-Regulated Phosphoprotein 19.
PG  - 419-30
AB  - Background/Aims: miR-802 plays a key role in cancer progression and development. 
      The purpose of this work is to investigate the functional role of miR-802 in
      laryngeal cancer and to elucidate the function of miR-802 and cAMP-regulated
      phosphoprotein 19 (ARPP19) on laryngeal cancer. Methods: RT-qPCR was applied to
      study the expression level of ARPP19 and miR-802 in the laryngeal carcinoma cell 
      lines and tissues. CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry (FACS) assay were used
      to study the effect of ARPP19 and miR-802 on apoptosis, proliferation, and cell
      cycle of laryngeal carcinoma cells. Target gene prediction and luciferase
      reporter gene assay were applied to identify target gene of miR-802. The
      transcriptional mRNA and protein expression levels of ARPP19 were measured by
      RT-qPCR or Western blotting. Results: miR-802 was down-regulated in laryngeal
      carcinoma cell lines and tissues. Laryngeal cancer cells transfected by miR-802
      mimic were significantly inhibited in the terms of cell colony formation and
      proliferation. Furthermore, miR-802 can inhibit the expression level of ARPP19 by
      directly targeting the 3ʹ untranslated region (3ʹ-UTR) of ARPP19. Overexpression 
      of the ARPP19 gene can reverse the suppressive effect of miR-802 on laryngeal
      cancer cells. Conclusion: miR-802 can exert tumor suppressor effects in laryngeal
      carcinoma by targeting ARPP19, indicating that miR-802 protein may play a role of
      potential therapeutic target for clinical laryngeal cancer.

TI  - Immersive virtual reality as analgesia for women during hysterosalpingography:
      study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 102
AB  - Background: Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is an accepted radiologic diagnostic
      modality for initial infertility workup, and is generally considered
      uncomfortable and painful. However, the management of pain related to HSG remains
      inefficient. As an emerging nonpharmacologic and noninvasive pain control
      strategy, virtual reality (VR) distraction has been successfully used in areas
      such as burns, blunt force trauma, hospital-based needle procedures,
      dental/periodontal procedures, and urological endoscopy patients. This study aims
      to evaluate the analgesic effect of VR during HSG. Methods/design: A
      single-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial will be carried out in
      the Radiology Department of Yinchuan Women and Children Healthcare Hospital,
      Yinchuan. A total of 200 participants who are scheduled for HSG will be enrolled 
      in this study. The participants will be randomized (1:1) into two groups: a VR
      group and a blank control group. The VR group will receive routine care plus
      immersive VR intervention and the blank control group will receive routine care. 
      Outcomes will be monitored at baseline, immediately after HSG and 15 min after
      HSG for each group. The primary outcome is the worst pain score during HSG by a
      visual analog scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes include: affective pain,
      cognitive pain, and anxiety during the HSG procedure; worst pain within 15 min
      after HSG; patient satisfaction and acceptance with pain management;
      physiological parameters; adverse effects; HSG results; and immersion perception 
      score of the VR system (for the VR condition only). Discussion: This study will
      focus on exploring a simply operated, noninvasive and low-cost analgesia during
      the HSG procedure. The results of this trial will provide data on the feasibility
      and safety of VR distraction therapy during HSG. Trial registration: Chinese
      Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR1900021342. Registered on 16 February 2019.

TI  - A prospective randomized controlled study of auricular point acupressure to
      manage chronic low back pain in older adults: study protocol.
LID - 99
AB  - Background: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a major health problem and the most
      common pain condition among those aged 60 years or older in the US. Despite the
      development of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, cLBP
      outcomes have not improved and disability rates continue to rise. This study aims
      to test auricular point acupressure (APA) as a non-invasive, nonpharmacological
      self-management strategy to manage cLBP and to address current shortcomings of
      cLBP treatment. Methods/design: For this prospective randomized controlled study,
      participants will be randomly assigned to three groups: (1) APA group (active
      points related to cLBP), (2) Comparison group-1 (non-active points, unrelated to 
      cLBP), and (3) Comparison group-2 (enhanced educational control, an educational
      booklet on cLBP will be given and the treatment used by participants for their
      cLBP will be recorded). The ecological momentary assessment smartphone app will
      be used to collect real-time cLBP outcomes and adherence to APA practice.
      Treatment and nonspecific psychological placebo effects will be measured via
      questionnaires for all participants. This proposed trial will evaluate the APA
      sustained effects for cLBP at 12-month follow-up. Monthly telephone follow-up
      will be used to collect study outcomes. Blood will be collected during study
      visits at baseline, post APA treatment, and follow-up study visits at 1, 3, 6, 9 
      and 12 months post completion of treatment for a total of seven assessments.
      Appointments will start between 9 and 11 am to control for circadian variation in
      cytokine levels. Discussion: This study is expected to provide vital information 
      on the efficacy, sustainability, and underlying mechanism of APA on cLBP
      necessary for APA to gain acceptance from both healthcare providers and patients,
      which would provide a strong impetus for including APA as part of cLBP management
      in clinical and home settings. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID:

TI  - Routes of non-traditional entry into buprenorphine treatment programs.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: Excessive prescribing, increased potency of opioids, and increased
      availability of illicit heroin and synthetic analogs such as fentanyl has
      resulted in an increase of overdose fatalities. Medications for opioid use
      disorder (MOUD) significantly reduces the risk of overdose when compared with no 
      treatment. Although the use of buprenorphine as an agonist treatment for opioid
      use disorder (OUD) is growing significantly, barriers remain which can prevent or
      delay treatment. In this study we examine non-traditional routes which could
      facilitate entry into buprenorphine treatment programs. Methods: Relevant,
      original research publications addressing entry into buprenorphine treatment
      published during the years 1989–2019 were identified through PubMed, PsychInfo,
      PsychArticles, and Medline databases. We operationalized key terms based on three
      non-traditional paths: persons that entered treatment via the criminal justice
      system, following emergencies, and through community outreach. Results: Of 462
      screened articles, twenty studies met the inclusion criteria for full review.
      Most studies were from the last several years, and most (65%) were from the
      Northeastern region of the United States. Twelve (60%) were studies suggesting
      that the criminal justice system could be a potentially viable entry route, both 
      pre-release or post-incarceration. The emergency department was also found to be 
      a cost-effective and viable route for screening and identifying individuals with 
      OUD and linking them to buprenorphine treatment. Fewer studies have documented
      community outreach initiatives involving buprenorphine. Most studies were small
      sample size (mean = < 200) and 40% were randomized trials. Conclusions: Despite
      research suggesting that increasing the number of Drug Addiction Treatment Act
      (DATA) waived physicians who prescribe buprenorphine would help with the opioid
      treatment gap, little research has been conducted on routes to increase
      utilization of treatment. In this study, we found evidence that engaging
      individuals through criminal justice, emergency departments, and community
      outreach can serve as non-traditional treatment entry points for certain
      populations. Alternative routes could engage a greater number of people to
      initiate MOUD treatment.

TI  - Morphine plasmatic concentration in a pregnant mare and its foal after long term 
      epidural administration.
LID - 19
AB  - Background: Epidural administration of morphine has been shown to be an effective
      analgesic strategy in horses; however, the possible occurrence of side effects
      limits its usage. In order to decrease their frequency, it is important to target
      the minimal effective plasma concentration and avoid overdosing. As to date
      species-specific pharmacokinetics data are not available for epidural morphine,
      the dosing regimen is usually established on the basis of clinical reports and
      personal experience. In certain physiological conditions, like gestation, the
      outcome of an empirical dosing scheme can be unpredictable. The aim of this case 
      report is to describe the pharmacological profile of morphine and its metabolites
      after prolonged epidural administration in a pregnant mare and her foal. Case
      presentation: A 20 years old pregnant mare was presented to our hospital because 
      of severe lameness, 2 months before delivery. Following an ineffective systemic
      pain treatment, an epidural catheter was inserted and morphine administered
      (initial dose 0.1 mg/kg every 8 h). Due to its efficacy in controlling pain, it
      was continued until end of gestation. Plasmatic concentration of morphine and its
      metabolites were assessed in the mare 6 weeks after starting the treatment, and
      in both the mare and foal during the first days after delivery. Plasmatic values 
      similar to those previously reported in the literature following morphine short
      term administration through various routes and not accompanied by side effects
      were found in the mare, except during an excitatory period. Moreover, no evidence
      of dangerous drug accumulation or significant milk passage was noticed in the
      foal. Mild reduction of feces production with no signs of colic and two
      self-limiting episodes of excitement occurred during treatment in the mare. No
      side effects occurred during gestation and first phases of life in the foal.
      Conclusion: Prolonged epidural administration of morphine in a pregnant mare
      allowed good pain control in absence of clinically relevant side effects, in both
      the mare and her foal. Sudden increase in morphine plasmatic concentration can
      occur and side effects appear; careful treatment to the lowest effective dose and
      continuous monitoring of the clinical condition of the treated horse should be
      performed.

TI  - Building healthcare provider relationships for patient-centered care: A
      qualitative study of the experiences of people receiving injectable opioid
      agonist treatment.
LID - 7
AB  - Background: Injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT) was designed as a
      pragmatic and compassionate approach for people who have not benefitted from
      medication assisted treatment with oral opioids (e.g., methadone). While, a
      substantial body of clinical trial evidence has demonstrated the safety and
      effectiveness of iOAT, considerably less is known about the patient-centered
      aspects of this treatment and their role in self-reported treatment goals and
      outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore participants’ experiences in iOAT 
      as they broadly relate to the domains of patient-centered care. A secondary goal 
      was to explore how these experiences affected participants’ self-reported
      treatment outcomes. Methods: A qualitative methodology, and constructivist
      grounded theory approach, was used to guide sampling, data collection and
      analysis. A total of 30 in-depth interviews were conducted with people receiving 
      iOAT in North America’s first clinic. Audio-recordings for each semi-structured
      interview were transcribed and read repeatedly. The strategy of constant
      comparison was used through iterative stages of line-by-line, focused and
      theoretical coding until theoretical saturation was achieved. Results: “Building 
      healthcare provider relationships for patient-centered care in iOAT” was the
      emergent core concept. Healthcare provider relationships were established through
      two interrelated processes: ‘Opening up’ was attributed to the positive
      environment, and to feeling understood and supported by healthcare providers.
      ‘Being a part of care’ emerged as participants felt safe to ask for what was
      needed and had opportunities to collaborate in treatment decisions. These
      processes established a foundation in which participants experienced care that
      was responsive to their individual dose, health and psychosocial needs.
      Conclusions: The core concept suggested that therapeutic relationships were
      fundamental to experiences of patient-centered care in iOAT. When relationships
      were respectful and understanding, participants received individualized and
      holistic care in iOAT. These findings offer a valuable example of how therapeutic
      relationships can be strengthened in other substance use treatment settings,
      particularly when responding to the diverse treatment needs of clients.

TI  - Risk factors for prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay among patients
      with acute drug overdose in Japan.
LID - e482
AB  - Aim: Hospital selection for patients with drug overdose (DOD) is a critical
      issue. In Tokyo, the 50‐tablet rule has been widely utilized by paramedics for
      triaging patients with DOD given that it shortens the triage time. However,
      studies have not investigated the utility of such a rule in local cities. The
      present study aimed to identify prognostic pre‐ and in‐hospital factors among
      patients with DOD and determine whether the 50‐tablet rule benefits local cities.
      Methods: Clinical records of patients with DOD admitted at the University of
      Tsukuba Hospital (Tsukuba, Japan) between 2013 and 2017 were retrospectively
      reviewed. Results: A total of 93 patients with DOD were enrolled in this study.
      Multivariate analysis showed that creatine kinase and C‐reactive protein values
      and the total number of ingested pills were in‐hospital risk factors that
      significantly prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay. Moreover,
      Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission and the total number of ingested pills were
      identified as significant pre‐hospital risk factors for prolonged ICU and
      hospital stay. Setting the total number of ingested pills to 50 tablets did not
      significantly influence ICU and hospital stay. Conclusion: The total number of
      ingested pills and creatine kinase and C‐reactive protein values were identified 
      as predictive factors for prolonged ICU and hospital stay in patients with DOD
      after admission. Moreover, pre‐hospital risk factors included Glasgow Coma Scale 
      score and the total number of ingested pills. However, the 50‐tablet rule was
      determined to be a poor cut‐off value for patients with DOD. We presented a
      subset of our findings at the 46th annual meeting of the Japanese Society for
      Acute Medicine (Yokohama, Japan) on 20 November 2018.

TI  - Re-prioritizing traffic stops to reduce motor vehicle crash outcomes and racial
      disparities.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: Law enforcement traffic stops are one of the most common entryways to
      the US justice system. Conventional frameworks suggest traffic stops promote
      public safety by reducing dangerous driving practices and non-vehicular crime.
      Law enforcement agencies have wide latitude in enforcement, including
      prioritization of stop types: (1) safety (e.g. moving violation) stops, (2)
      investigatory stops, or (3) economic (regulatory and equipment) stops. In order
      to prevent traffic crash fatalities and reduce racial disparities, the police
      department of Fayetteville, North Carolina significantly re-prioritized safety
      stops. Methods: Annual traffic stop, motor vehicle crash, and crime data from
      2002 to 2016 were combined to examine intervention (2013–2016) effects.
      Fayetteville was compared against synthetic control agencies built from 8 similar
      North Carolina agencies by weighted matching on pre-intervention period trends
      and comparison against post-intervention trends. Results: On average over the
      intervention period as compared to synthetic controls, Fayetteville increased
      both the number of safety stops + 121% (95% confidence interval + 17%, + 318%)
      and the relative proportion of safety stops (+ 47%). Traffic crash and injury
      outcomes were reduced, including traffic fatalities − 28% (− 64%, + 43%),
      injurious crashes − 23% (− 49%, + 16%), and total crashes − 13% (− 48%, + 21%).
      Disparity measures were reduced, including Black percent of traffic stops − 7%
      (− 9%, − 5%) and Black vs. White traffic stop rate ratio − 21% (− 29%, − 13%). In
      contrast to the Ferguson Effect hypothesis, the relative de-prioritization of
      investigatory stops was not associated with an increase in non-traffic crime
      outcomes, which were reduced or unchanged, including index crimes − 10% (− 25%,
      + 8%) and violent crimes − 2% (− 33%, + 43%). Confidence intervals were estimated
      using a different technique and, given small samples, may be asymmetrical.
      Conclusions: The re-prioritization of traffic stop types by law enforcement
      agencies may have positive public health consequences both for motor vehicle
      injury and racial disparity outcomes while having little impact on non-traffic
      crime.

TI  - The Risk of Drug-Drug Interactions with Paracetamol in a Population of
      Hospitalized Geriatric Patients.
LID - 1354209
AB  - Aims: This study investigates the consumption of paracetamol and the risk of
      potential drug-drug interactions and assesses the clinical impact hereof in
      patients admitted to a department of geriatric medicine. Methods: A retrospective
      and longitudinal study was conducted in patients who had been receiving
      paracetamol upon or during hospitalization. The hospital files of the included
      patients were reviewed, including documentation of concomitant medications,
      diagnoses, biochemical values, and adverse incidents during admission. These
      parameters were used as a clinical follow-up when assessing a clinical
      probability impact of the identified drug-drug interactions. Results: In total,
      104 patients were admitted during the study period. 91 (87.5%) of these (mean age
      86 years) received a prescription or were treated with paracetamol. Of these, 10%
      were evaluated as being at risk of potential drug-drug interactions with
      paracetamol. Seven of the potential drug-drug interactions were related to
      treatments with warfarin, one with valsartan and one with phenytoin. Of the nine 
      patients at risk, six did experience either abnormal biochemical values or
      potential related clinical incidents. Four patients experienced increased INR
      (range 3.2–4.6), of which one patient suffered from anaemia and one with
      hematemesis. Two patients experienced increased ALAT/ASAT (55/42 U/I and
      87/51 U/I, both females). One experienced hypertension. Conclusion: A large
      majority of the patients in this study received treatment with paracetamol. Six
      patients were evaluated as having abnormal biochemical values or were
      experiencing clinical incidents during their hospitalization potentially related 
      to the identified potential drug-drug interactions.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA H19 in the injured dorsal root ganglion contributes to
      peripheral nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity.
PG  - 176-84
AB  - Peripheral nerve injury-induced changes in gene transcription and translation in 
      the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) play a critical role in the development and
      maintenance of neuropathic pain. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene
      expression. Here, we report that peripheral nerve injury caused by ligation of
      the fourth spinal nerve (SNL) led to a time-dependent increase in the expression 
      in H19, an lncRNA, in the injured DRG. Microinjection of a specific H19 siRNA,
      but not negative control scrambled siRNA, into the injured DRG 4 days before SNL 
      alleviated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia on days 3 and 5
      post-SNL. Additionally, DRG microinjection of the H19 siRNA on day 7 after SNL
      reduced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia on days 10 and 12 post-SNL.
      DRG microinjection of neither siRNA affected locomotor activity and acute basal
      responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli. Our findings suggest that H19
      participates in the peripheral mechanism underlying the development and
      maintenance of neuropathic pain. H19 may be a potential target for treatment of
      this disorder.

      for 11 normal corneas. Subbasal corneal nerves were analyzed for total nerve
      number, main nerve trunk number, branching patterns and tortuosity. C57BL/6 mice 
      were infected with Aspergillus fumigatus. Disease severity was determined through
      clinical scoring and slit lamp photography. Corneas were harvested at 1, 3, 5,
      and 7d post infection (p.i.) and assessed for β III tubulin. Corneal mechanical
      sensitivity thresholds were detected by von Frey test. β-endorphin (β-EP) and µ
      receptor protein expression was detected through Western blotting. RESULTS: Total
      nerve number, main nerve trunk number, and nerve branching were significantly
      lower in FK patients than in controls, but tortuosity was not significantly
      different. In infected mice, subbasal nerve density decreased from 1d p.i.,
      reaching a minimum at 5d p.i. Clinical scores rose at 1d p.i., peaked at 3d p.i.,
      and decreased at 5d p.i. Mechanical sensitivity thresholds showed the same
      trends. β-EP and µ receptor protein expression increased after infection.
      CONCLUSION: Corneal nerve density is lower in FK patients and Aspergillus
      fumigatus-infected mice than in controls. Pain sensitivity decreases with
      postinfection corneal ulcer aggravation. β-EP and µ receptor proteins are both
      upregulated in infected mouse corneas.

TI  - Knowledge About Postoperative Pain and Its Management in Surgical Patients.
LID - e6685
AB  - Background: Research has shown that more than 50% of patients have insufficient
      postoperative pain relief despite the use of multiple pain management modalities.
      Insufficient pain relief leads to several pathophysiological effects. One of the 
      barriers to optimal pain relief is patient’s lack of knowledge regarding the
      options available for pain management and their potential side effects. In this
      survey, we evaluated surgical patients’ knowledge about postoperative pain and
      its management in patients undergoing major upper abdominal surgeries at a
      tertiary care hospital.Methods and Material: This was a cross-sectional survey. A
      total of 155 patients (18-60 years of age) scheduled to undergo elective major
      upper abdominal surgery were included after ethical approval and informed
      consent. Preoperatively, patients were interviewed through a questionnaire
      regarding knowledge about postoperative pain and its management.Results: The
      average age of the patients was 42.97 ± 13.05 years. Excellent and good knowledge
      were observed in 11.61% and 21.94% patients, respectively, whereas fair and poor 
      knowledge were seen in 42.58% and 23.87%, respectively. Inadequate knowledge was 
      more marked regarding analgesic side effects and addiction risk. Education level,
      history of surgery, and adequate information provision about pain management plan
      by surgeons preoperatively were significantly associated with a higher level of
      knowledge about pain and its management (p-value 0.0005, 0.002, and 0.0005,
      respectively).Conclusion: A considerable proportion of patients have inadequate
      knowledge about their postoperative pain and its management, particularly in
      areas of side effects and addiction risk.

      Reinnervation.
LID - e2383
AB  - Neuroma pain significantly impacts patient quality of life and is associated with
      unemployment, chronic opioid dependence, and depression. Targeted muscle
      reinnervation (TMR), a surgical technique that coapts proximal stumps of cut
      nerves to distal motor nerves of adjacent muscles, has demonstrated efficacy in
      the treatment and prevention of neuroma pain. The objective of this study was to 
      describe the surgical technique for TMR of the saphenous nerve, while providing a
      retrospective review. Between January 2015 and December 2018, 18 patients
      underwent TMR of the saphenous nerve: 1 nonamputee patient with chronic pain
      after ankle surgery and 17 amputee patients (10 for relief of chronic
      postamputation neuroma pain and phantom pain and 7 at the time of amputation for 
      prevention of these symptoms). Six patients were lost to follow up; 2 patients
      had recurrent pain; and 10 patients had reduced or no pain after TMR surgery. TMR
      is a successful technique for the management of traumatic neuroma pain in both
      the amputee and nonamputee populations, and in this study, we describe the
      technique for saphenous nerve TMR.

TI  - The Role of CYP450 Drug Metabolism in Precision Cardio-Oncology.
LID - 604
AB  - As many novel cancer therapies continue to emerge, the field of Cardio-Oncology
      (or onco-cardiology) has become crucial to prevent, monitor and treat cancer
      therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity. Furthermore, given the narrow
      therapeutic window of most cancer therapies, drug-drug interactions are prevalent
      in the cancer population. Consequently, there is an increased risk of affecting
      drug efficacy or predisposing individual patients to adverse side effects. Here
      we review the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in the field of
      Cardio-Oncology. We highlight the importance of cardiac medications in preventive
      Cardio-Oncology for high-risk patients or in the management of cardiotoxicities
      during or following cancer treatment. Common interactions between Oncology and
      Cardiology drugs are catalogued, emphasizing the impact of differential
      metabolism of each substrate drug on unpredictable drug bioavailability and
      consequent inter-individual variability in treatment response or development of
      cardiovascular toxicity. This inter-individual variability in bioavailability and
      subsequent response can be further enhanced by genomic variants in CYP450, or by 
      modifications of CYP450 gene, RNA or protein expression or function in various
      ‘omics’ related to precision medicine. Thus, we advocate for an individualized
      approach to each patient by a multidisciplinary team with clinical pharmacists
      evaluating a treatment plan tailored to a practice of precision Cardio-Oncology. 
      This review may increase awareness of these key concepts in the rapidly evolving 
      field of Cardio-Oncology.

TI  - Deciphering the Association of Cytokines, Chemokines, and Growth Factors in
      Chondrogenic Differentiation of Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Using an
      ex vivo Osteochondral Culture System.
LID - 380
AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disorder associated with
      degradation and decreased production of the extracellular matrix, eventually
      leading to cartilage destruction. Limited chondrocyte turnover, structural
      damage, and prevailing inflammatory milieu prevent efficient cartilage repair and
      restoration of joint function. In the present study, we evaluated the role of
      secreted cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors present in the culture
      supernatant obtained from an ex vivo osteochondral model of cartilage
      differentiation using cartilage pellets (CP), bone marrow stem cells (BM-MSCs),
      and/or BM-MSCs + CP. Multiplex cytokine analysis showed differential secretion of
      growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF, HGF, EGF, VEGF); chemokines (MCP-1, MIP1α, MIP1β, 
      RANTES, Eotaxin, IP-10), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6,
      IL-8, TNFα, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10,
      and IL-13) in the experimental groups compared to the control. In silico analyses
      of the role of stem cells and CP in relation to the expression of various
      molecules, canonical pathways and hierarchical cluster patterns were deduced
      using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen, United States). The 
      interactions of the cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that are involved
      in the cartilage differentiation showed that stem cells, when used together with 
      CP, bring about a favorable cell signaling that supports cartilage
      differentiation and additionally helps to attenuate inflammatory cytokines and
      further downstream disease-associated pro-inflammatory pathways. Hence, the
      autologous or allogeneic stem cells and local cartilage tissues may be used for
      efficient cartilage differentiation and the management of OA.

TI  - New Perspective in Diabetic Neuropathy: From the Periphery to the Brain, a Call
      for Early Detection, and Precision Medicine.
LID - 929
AB  - Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes
      mellitus. It leads to distressing and expensive clinical sequelae such as foot
      ulceration, leg amputation, and neuropathic pain (painful-DPN). Unfortunately,
      DPN is often diagnosed late when irreversible nerve injury has occurred and its
      first presentation may be with a diabetic foot ulcer. Several novel diagnostic
      techniques are available which may supplement clinical assessment and aid the
      early detection of DPN. Moreover, treatments for DPN and painful-DPN are limited.
      Only tight glucose control in type 1 diabetes has robust evidence in reducing the
      risk of developing DPN. However, neither glucose control nor pathogenetic
      treatments are effective in painful-DPN and symptomatic treatments are often
      inadequate. It has recently been hypothesized that using various patient
      characteristics it may be possible to stratify individuals and assign them
      targeted therapies to produce better pain relief. We review the diagnostic
      techniques which may aid the early detection of DPN in the clinical and research 
      environment, and recent advances in precision medicine techniques for the
      treatment of painful-DPN.

TI  - Opioids Impair Intestinal Epithelial Repair in HIV-Infected Humanized Mice.
LID - 2999
AB  - Intestinal barrier dysfunction and subsequent microbial translocation play
      crucial roles in persistent immune activation leading to HIV disease progression.
      Opioid use is associated with worse outcome in HIV-infected patients. The
      exacerbated disease progression by opioids is mainly driven by excessive
      intestinal inflammation and increased gut permeability. The objective of this
      study is to investigate how opioids potentiate HIV disease progression by
      compromising intestinal barrier function and impairing intestinal epithelial
      self-repair mechanism. In the present study, abnormal intestinal morphology and
      reduced epithelial proliferation were observed in bone marrow-liver-thymus
      humanized mice and in HIV-infected patients who were exposed to opioids. In bone 
      marrow-liver-thymus mice, HIV, and morphine independently, and additively induced
      gut dysbiosis, especially depletion of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and
      Muribaculaceae. We also observed that the abundance of Lachnospiraceae,
      Ruminococcaceae, and Muribaculaceae negatively correlated with apoptosis of
      epithelial cells, and intestinal IL-6 levels. Previous studies have shown that
      these bacterial families play crucial roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis
      because they include most short-chain fatty acid-producing members. Short-chain
      fatty acids have been shown to maintain stem cell populations and suppress
      inflammation in the gut by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDAC). In addition,
      we demonstrate that morphine exposure inhibited growth of intestinal organoids
      derived from HIV transgenic mice by suppressing Notch signaling in an
      HDAC-dependent manner. These studies implicate an important role for HDAC in
      intestinal homeostasis and supports HDAC modulation as a therapeutic intervention
      in improving care of HIV patients, especially in opioid-abusing population.

TI  - The Risks and Outcomes Resulting From Medication Errors Reported in the Finnish
      Tertiary Care Units:: A Cross-Sectional Retrospective Register Study.
LID - 1571
AB  - Background: Hospital-acquired medication errors (MEs) are common in health care. 
      Although voluntary reporting is criticized for not producing reliable estimates
      on ME frequency, it provides valuable knowledge on errors occurring in the
      medication process.Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze and
      determine the risks and outcomes resulting from MEs related to the TOP15
      medicines in the Finnish tertiary care units from July 2016 to July 2017.Methods:
      The data consisting of 1,447 ME reports was organized according to ATC
      classification, after which TOP15 medicines involved in the reports were
      selected. Inductive content analysis was performed to the reports. After this,
      the reports were categorized by ME outcome into five categories and further
      analyzed accordingly.Results: The most common ME outcome in the reports was
      “omitted medicine” (33.9%). More than a quarter (27.1%) of ME reports were
      estimated to cause moderate or severe risk to the patient. When compared with
      each other, none of the outcome groups were more susceptible to high-risk events 
      (p = 0.71). Of the TOP15 medicines, only Norepinephrine had significantly higher 
      risk of being involved in high-risk events (OR 2.43, 95%CI 1.35–4.61).Conclusion:
      Voluntary reporting has an important role in the development of medication safety
      and the overall medication process within organizations. Although majority of the
      TOP15 medicines were involved in MEs resulting in seemingly high-risk outcomes,
      they were estimated to be insignificant or minor within the reporting unit. In
      the future, more emphasis will be needed for the assessment and analysis of the
      reports for more efficient, real-time detection and response to signals from
      health care units.

TI  - The Effect of UGT1A9, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 Genes Polymorphism on Propofol
      Pharmacokinetics in Children.
PG  - 13-27
AB  - Purpose: This study was conducted to determine the effect of UGT1A9 98T>C, CYP2B6
      516G>T and CYP2C9 430C>T genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of
      propofol in children of different sexes and ages who undergone total intravenous 
      anesthesia (ТIVA) and deep sedation during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
      Patients and Methods: The prospective study included 94 children, ASA I-II
      status, 1 to 17 years of age, who undergone standard anesthetic protocol for
      TIVA, which implied the continuous use of propofol. Before the administration of 
      propofol, venous blood was sampled to determine the presence of genetic
      variations in UGT1A9, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 gene using a polymerase chain
      reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). From each patient
      included in the study blood samples were taken: 10 mins after the induction of
      anesthesia, immediately before the discontinuation of the propofol infusion,
      10 mins after discontinuation of the propofol infusion and 20 mins after
      discontinuation of the propofol infusion to determine the pharmacokinetics of the
      drug in the plasma of the subjects The plasma propofol concentration was
      determined by HPLC analytical technique. Results: UGT1A9 genotype is an
      independent predictor of the propofol concentration in children immediately after
      the end of the continuous infusion and 10 mins afterwards. In the carriers of the
      polymorphic UGT1A9 C allele, the propofol distribution constant was higher. The
      carriers of the polymorphic CYP2B6 T allele received a significantly lower
      overall and initial dose of propofol. Unlike polymorphism of the UGT1A9 gene, the
      tested CYP2C9 and CYP2B6 gene polymorphisms are not independent predictors of the
      pharmacokinetics of propofol. Conclusion: Further investigations of UGT1A9,
      CYP2B6 and CYP2C9 and other genes that participate in propofol metabolism as well
      as detailed analyses of the general conditions, administered therapies and
      associated diseases could explain the large interindividual variability of
      propofol metabolism in children.

TI  - Association Between Bullying and Suicidal Behavior Among Chinese Adolescents: An 
      Analysis of Gender Differences.
PG  - 89-96
AB  - Background: Suicide has become the leading cause of death among 15–34 years old
      in China, and more attention should be paid to risk factors and prevention of
      suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. The school-based survey was conducted to 
      test the associations of bullying behavior with suicidal ideation and suicide
      attempts, and to assess whether the biological gender can moderate these
      associations. Methods: A multistage stratified cluster sampling method was used
      to recruit participants from high schools in Guizhou, China, and univariate and
      multivariate logistic regression models were fitted. Results: A total of 23,392
      students were included in the analysis, and 45.4% were boys. The mean age of the 
      students was 15.2 (SD: 1.9) years. Overall, 3.8% (882) of the students were
      victims, 4.9% (1144) were bullies, and 3.2% (736) were bully-victims. A total of 
      18.9% of students reported having suicidal ideation, and 3.9% reported having
      suicide attempts. Victims (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.15, 95% CI=1.84–2.51),
      bullies (AOR=3.17, 95% CI=2.78–3.62), and bully-victims (AOR=3.18, 95%
      CI=2.71–3.73) were at an elevated risk of suicidal ideation than neutrals;
      similar associations can be found in the associations between bullying behavior
      and suicide attempts. Further stratification analyses showed that the
      associations of being bullied or bullying others with suicidal ideation and
      suicide attempts were slightly stronger in girls than in boys. Conclusion:
      Prevention or intervention programs are recommended to take the biological gender
      into consideration, and future studies are also warranted to investigate the
      reasons of differences by gender in the association of bullying and suicidal
      behavior.

TI  - Identification of genetic polymorphisms modulating nausea and vomiting in two
      series of opioid-treated cancer patients.
LID - 542
AB  - Nausea and vomiting are often associated with opioid analgesia in cancer
      patients; however, only a subset of patients develop such side effects. Here, we 
      tested the hypothesis that the occurrence of nausea and vomiting is modulated by 
      the genetic background of the patients. Whole exome sequencing of DNA pools from 
      patients with either low (n = 937) or high (n = 557) nausea and vomiting
      intensity, recruited in the European Pharmacogenetic Opioid Study, revealed a
      preliminary association of 53 polymorphisms. PCR-based genotyping of 45 of these 
      polymorphisms in the individual patients of the same series confirmed the
      association for six SNPs in AIM1L, CLCC1, MUC16, PDE3A, POM121L2, and ZNF165
      genes. Genotyping of the same 45 polymorphisms in 264 patients of the Italian
      CERP study, also treated with opioids for cancer pain, instead confirmed the
      association for two SNPs in ZNF568 and PDE3A genes. Only one SNP, rs12305038 in
      PDE3A, was confirmed in both series, although with opposite effects of the minor 
      allele on the investigated phenotype. Overall, our findings suggest that genetic 
      factors are indeed associated with nausea and vomiting in opioid-treated cancer
      patients, but the role of individual polymorphisms may be weak.

TI  - Socioeconomic risk factors for fatal opioid overdoses in the United States:
      Findings from the Mortality Disparities in American Communities Study (MDAC).
LID - e0227966
AB  - Background: Understanding relationships between individual-level demographic,
      socioeconomic status (SES) and U.S. opioid fatalities can inform interventions in
      response to this crisis. Methods: The Mortality Disparities in American Community
      Study (MDAC) links nearly 4 million 2008 American Community Survey responses to
      the 2008–2015 National Death Index. Univariate and multivariable models were used
      to estimate opioid overdose fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). Results: Opioid overdose was an overrepresented cause of death
      among people 10 to 59 years of age. In multivariable analysis, compared to
      Hispanics, Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives had elevated risk (HR =
      2.52, CI:2.21–2.88) and (HR = 1.88, CI:1.35–2.62), respectively. Compared to
      women, men were at-risk (HR = 1.61, CI:1.50–1.72). People who were disabled were 
      at higher risk than those who were not (HR = 2.80, CI:2.59–3.03). Risk was higher
      among widowed than married (HR = 2.44, CI:2.03–2.95) and unemployed than employed
      individuals (HR = 2.46, CI:2.17–2.79). Compared to adults with graduate degrees, 
      those with high school only were at-risk (HR = 2.48, CI:2.00–3.06). Citizens were
      more likely than noncitizens to die from this cause (HR = 4.62, CI:3.48–6.14).
      Compared to people who owned homes with mortgages, those who rented had higher
      HRs (HR = 1.36, CI:1.25–1.48). Non-rural residents had higher risk than rural
      residents (HR = 1.46, CI:1.34, 1.59). Compared to respective referent groups,
      people without health insurance (HR = 1.30, CI:1.20–1.41) and people who were
      incarcerated were more likely to die from opioid overdoses (HR = 2.70,
      CI:1.91–3.81). Compared to people living in households at least five-times above 
      the poverty line, people who lived in poverty were more likely to die from this
      cause (HR = 1.36, CI:1.20–1.54). Compared to people living in West North Central 
      states, HRs were highest among those in South Atlantic (HR = 1.29, CI:1.11, 1.50)
      and Mountain states (HR = 1.58, CI:1.33, 1.88). Discussion: Opioid fatality was
      associated with indicators of low SES. The findings may help to target
      prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts to vulnerable groups.

TI  - Outpatient narcotic consumption following total shoulder arthroplasty.
PG  - 100-4
AB  - Introduction: In the setting of the opioid epidemic, physicians continue to
      scrutinize ways to minimize exposure to narcotic medications. Several studies
      emphasize improvements in perioperative pain management following total shoulder 
      arthroplasty (TSA). However, there is a paucity of literature describing
      outpatient narcotic consumption requirements following TSA. Methods: A
      single-institution, prospective study of patients undergoing primary TSA was
      performed. Preoperative demographics including exposure to narcotics, smoking
      history, and alcohol exposure were collected. The primary outcome was measurement
      of total outpatient narcotic consumption 6 weeks from surgery. Narcotic
      consumption was verified by counting leftover pills at the final follow-up visit.
      Results: Overall, 50 patients were enrolled. The median narcotic consumption in
      the cohort was 193 morphine equivalent units (MEUs), approximately 25 (5-mg)
      tablets of oxycodone, and the mean consumption was 246 MEUs, approximately 32
      (5-mg) tablets. Almost 25% of patients consumed fewer than 10 total tablets, with
      10% of patients taking no narcotics at home. Multivariate regression found
      preoperative narcotic exposure associated with increased consumption of 31 MEUs
      (P = .004). Older age was found to be protective of narcotic consumption, with
      increasing age by 1 year associated with 0.75 MEU decrease in consumption (P =
      .04). Conclusions: Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty in general provides
      quick, reliable pain relief and does not require a significant amount of narcotic
      medication postoperatively. For most patients, it is reasonable to prescribe the 
      equivalent of 25-30 (5-mg) oxycodone tablets following TSA.

TI  - Activation of mGluR5 and NMDA Receptor Pathways in the Rostral Ventrolateral
      Medulla as a Central Mechanism for Methamphetamine-Induced Pressor Effect in
      Rats.
LID - 149
AB  - Acute hypertension produced by methamphetamine (MA) is well known, mainly by the 
      enhancement of catecholamine release from sympathetic terminals. However, the
      central pressor mechanism of the blood-brain-barrier-penetrating molecule remains
      unclear. We used radio-telemetry and femoral artery cannulation to monitor the
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) in conscious free-moving and urethane-anesthetized
      rats, respectively. Expression of Fos protein (Fos) and phosphorylation of
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit GluN1 in the rostral ventrolateral medulla 
      (RVLM) were detected using Western blot analysis. ELISA was carried out for
      detection of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the RVLM. MA-induced glutamate
      release in the RVLM was assayed using in vivo microdialysis and HPLC. Systemic or
      intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of MA augments the MAP and
      increases Fos expression, PKC activity, and phosphorylated GluN1-ser 896
      (pGluN1-ser 896) in the RVLM. However, direct microinjection of MA into the RVLM 
      did not change the MAP. Unilateral microinjection of a PKC inhibitor or a
      metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonist into the RVLM
      dose-dependently attenuated the i.c.v. MA-induced increase in MAP and pGluN1-ser 
      896. Our data suggested that MA may give rise to glutamate release in the RVLM
      further to the activation of mGluR5-PKC pathways, which would serve as a central 
      mechanism for the MA-induced pressor effect.

TI  - Feasibility and Acceptability of an mHealth-Based Approach as an HIV Prevention
      Strategy Among People Who Use Drugs on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis.
PG  - 107-18
AB  - Introduction: There has been increasing interest in the use of mHealth technology
      in health care. To our knowledge, however, there is a lack of empirical evidence 
      on the utilization of text messaging services (short message service; SMS) for
      HIV prevention among opioid-dependent people who use drugs (PWUD). As part of our
      formative work, we conducted an in-depth feasibility and acceptability study on
      the use of SMS reminders for HIV prevention in this risk group. Methods: Forty
      HIV-negative, opioid-dependent PWUD who are currently taking pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) were enrolled in the study. Participants received daily PrEP
      text reminders and weekly HIV risk reduction-related messages, which were
      developed using a user-centered approach. Participants were assessed at baseline 
      and immediately post-intervention. Following the post-intervention assessment,
      participants completed an in-depth qualitative interview. Results: Feasibility of
      text messaging service was high, as assessed by participants’ willingness to
      receive text messages (100%), retention (95%), and successful delivery of text
      messages (97%). Results further showed that participants were satisfied and
      perceived the use of daily PrEP reminder text messages as valuable and acceptable
      [mean: 75.0 (range 0–100)]. Whereas, acceptability for the weekly text messages
      on HIV risk reduction was 60.3 (±15.6), with 58.3% recommending them for future
      use. Thematic data exploration revealed important information for understanding
      and refining SMS content as well as logistical preferences. Conclusion: Our
      findings provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and acceptability of a
      text messaging-based approach as a potential tool for primary HIV prevention to
      improve PrEP adherence and HIV risk reduction among this underserved population. 
      HIV risk reduction text messages need further modifications to become more
      appealing, with participant feedback taken into consideration.

TI  - Fluoroscopy-Guided Percutaneous Sacroplasty for Painful Metastases at the Sacral 
      Ala.
PG  - 151-6
AB  - Objective: Percutaneous sacroplasty (PSP) is widely used in the clinic for
      osteoporotic sacral insufficiency fractures; however, few reports have described 
      the safety and effectiveness of PSP for painful sacral metastases at the sacral
      ala under fluoroscopy alone. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      fluoroscopy-guided PSP for painful metastases at the sacral ala. Patients and
      Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients (median age, 60.74 ± 12.74 years), with
      a total of 41 metastatic lesions at the sacral ala, were treated with PSP. The
      patients were followed up for periods ranging from 1 month to 30 months (average,
      8.23 ± 6.75 months). The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index
      (ODI), and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) were used to evaluate pain,
      mobility, and quality of life before the procedure and at 3 days and 1, 3, 6, 12,
      and 18 months after the procedure. Results: Technical success was achieved in all
      patients. The minimum follow-up duration was 1 month. The mean VAS scores
      declined significantly from 7.20 ± 0.93 before the procedure to 3.43 ± 1.38 by
      day 3 after the procedure, and was 3.13 ± 1.07 at 1 month, 3.17 ± 1.15 at 3
      months, 2.91± 1.38 at 6 months, and 2.57 ± 1.51 at 12 months after the procedure 
      (P < 0.001). After PSP, analgesic drug administration had been discontinued in 31
      of 35 patients (88.57%). The ODI and KPS also changed after PSP, with significant
      differences between the baseline scores and those at each follow-up examination
      (P < 0.001). Extraosseous cement leakage occurred in 12 cases without any major
      clinical complications. Conclusion: PSP is a safe and effective technique for the
      palliative treatment of painful metastases involving the sacral ala under
      fluoroscopic guidance alone. It can relieve pain, reduce disability, and improve 
      function, and is associated with minimal complications.

TI  - Incidence of Opioid Overdose Among Patients Using ER/LA Opioid Analgesics Before 
      and After Implementation of the Class-Wide Opioid Risk Evaluation and Mitigation 
      Strategy.
PG  - 157-69
AB  - Introduction: The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required 
      a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and
      long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics on 09 July 2012. Methods: This study
      compared the incidence of opioid overdose before (July 2010-June 2012) and after 
      (July 2013-September 2016) the initiation of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
      Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics.
      We identified patients with ≥1 ER/LA opioid dispensing in either time period in
      national data from the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and in
      United States (US) Medicaid claims data from four states. We described each
      population, calculated the incidence rate (IR) of opioid overdose, and assessed
      crude and propensity score adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing the
      overdose rate after vs before implementation of the REMS. Results: A total of
      121,229 commercially insured and 11,488 Medicaid patients were included in the
      analysis. Rates of overdose were substantially higher in Medicaid patients than
      in the commercially insured patients (IR 192.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      162.60–225.18 versus 102.60, 95% CI 93.0–112.93 in the active period). The IRRs
      for opioid overdose were 1.01 (95% CI 0.87–1.17) in the commercially insured
      population and 0.70 (95% CI 0.52–0.93) in Medicaid. Conclusion: This leveling off
      of overdose rates among commercially insured patients and decline among Medicaid 
      patients is encouraging, but it is difficult to disentangle the specific impact
      of the REMS from many other ongoing initiatives with similar goals.

TI  - Medicinal cannabis for psychiatric disorders: a clinically-focused systematic
      review.
LID - 24
AB  - Background: Medicinal cannabis has received increased research attention over
      recent years due to loosening global regulatory changes. Medicinal cannabis has
      been reported to have potential efficacy in reducing pain, muscle spasticity,
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and intractable childhood epilepsy. Yet
      its potential application in the field of psychiatry is lesser known. Methods:
      The first clinically-focused systematic review on the emerging medical
      application of cannabis across all major psychiatric disorders was conducted.
      Current evidence regarding whole plant formulations and plant-derived cannabinoid
      isolates in mood, anxiety, sleep, psychotic disorders and attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is discussed; while also detailing clinical
      prescription considerations (including pharmacogenomics), occupational and public
      health elements, and future research recommendations. The systematic review of
      the literature was conducted during 2019, assessing the data from all case
      studies and clinical trials involving medicinal cannabis or plant-derived
      isolates for all major psychiatric disorders (neurological conditions and pain
      were omitted). Results: The present evidence in the emerging field of cannabinoid
      therapeutics in psychiatry is nascent, and thereby it is currently premature to
      recommend cannabinoid-based interventions. Isolated positive studies have,
      however, revealed tentative support for cannabinoids (namely cannabidiol; CBD)
      for reducing social anxiety; with mixed (mainly positive) evidence for adjunctive
      use in schizophrenia. Case studies suggest that medicinal cannabis may be
      beneficial for improving sleep and post-traumatic stress disorder, however
      evidence is currently weak. Preliminary research findings indicate no benefit for
      depression from high delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) therapeutics, or for CBD 
      in mania. One isolated study indicates some potential efficacy for an oral
      cannabinoid/terpene combination in ADHD. Clinical prescriptive consideration
      involves caution in the use of high-THC formulations (avoidance in youth, and in 
      people with anxiety or psychotic disorders), gradual titration, regular
      assessment, and caution in cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, pregnancy
      and breast-feeding. Conclusions: There is currently encouraging, albeit
      embryonic, evidence for medicinal cannabis in the treatment of a range of
      psychiatric disorders. Supportive findings are emerging for some key isolates,
      however, clinicians need to be mindful of a range of prescriptive and
      occupational safety considerations, especially if initiating higher dose THC
      formulas.

TI  - Developing a clinical decision support for opioid use disorders: a NIDA center
      for the clinical trials network working group report.
LID - 4
AB  - There is an urgent need for strategies to address the US epidemic of prescription
      opioid, heroin and fentanyl-related overdoses, misuse, addiction, and diversion. 
      Evidence-based treatment such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are
      available but lack numbers of providers offering these services to meet the
      demands. Availability of electronic health record (EHR) systems has greatly
      increased and led to innovative quality improvement initiatives but this has not 
      yet been optimized to address the opioid epidemic or to treat opioid use disorder
      (OUD). This report from a clinical decision support (CDS) working group convened 
      by the NIDA Center for the Clinical Trials Network aims to converge electronic
      technology in the EHR with the urgent need to improve screening, identification, 
      and treatment of OUD in primary care settings through the development of a CDS
      algorithm that could be implemented as a tool in the EHR. This aim is consistent 
      with federal, state and local government and private sector efforts to improve
      access and quality of MOUD treatment for OUD, existing clinical quality and HEDIS
      measures for OUD or drug and alcohol use disorders, and with a recent draft grade
      B recommendation from the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) for
      screening for illicit drug use in adults when appropriate diagnosis, treatment
      and care services can be offered or referred. Through a face-to-face expert panel
      meeting and multiple follow-up conference calls, the working group drafted CDS
      algorithms for clinical care felt to be essential for screening, diagnosis, and
      management of OUD in primary care. The CDS algorithm was reviewed by addiction
      specialists and primary care providers and revised based on their input. A
      clinical decision support tool for OUD screening, assessment, and treatment
      within primary care systems may help improve healthcare delivery to help address 
      the current epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose that has outpaced the capacity
      of specialized treatment settings. A semi-structured outline of clinical decision
      support for OUD was developed to facilitate implementation within the EHR.
      Further work for adaptation at specific sites and for testing is needed.

TI  - Advances of Nano-Structured Extended-Release Local Anesthetics.
LID - 13
AB  - Extended-release local anesthetics (LAs) have drawn increasing attention with
      their promising role in improving analgesia and reducing adverse events of LAs.
      Nano-structured carriers such as liposomes and polymersomes optimally meet the
      demands of/for extended-release, and have been utilized in drug delivery over
      decades and showed satisfactory results with extended-release. Based on mature
      technology of liposomes, EXPAREL, the first approved liposomal LA loaded with
      bupivacaine, has seen its success in an extended-release form. At the same time, 
      polymersomes has advances over liposomes with complementary profiles, which
      inspires the emergence of hybrid carriers. This article summarized the recent
      research successes on nano-structured extended-release LAs, of which liposomal
      and polymeric are mainstream systems. Furthermore, with continual optimization,
      drug delivery systems carry properties beyond simple transportation, such as
      specificity and responsiveness. In the near future, we may achieve targeted
      delivery and controlled-release properties to satisfy various analgesic
      requirements.

TI  - Chronotherapy of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs May Enhance Postoperative 
      Recovery.
LID - 468
AB  - Postoperative pain relief is crucial for full recovery. With the ongoing opioid
      epidemic and the insufficient effect of acetaminophen on severe pain;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are heavily used to alleviate this
      pain. However, NSAIDs are known to inhibit postoperative healing of connective
      tissues by inhibiting prostaglandin signaling. Pain intensity, inflammatory
      mediators associated with wound healing and the pharmacological action of NSAIDs 
      vary throughout the day due to the circadian rhythm regulated by the clock genes.
      According to this rhythm, most of wound healing mediators and connective tissue
      formation occurs during the resting phase, while pain, inflammation and tissue
      resorption occur during the active period of the day. Here we show, in a murine
      tibia fracture surgical model, that NSAIDs are most effective in managing
      postoperative pain, healing and recovery when drug administration is limited to
      the active phase of the circadian rhythm. Limiting NSAID treatment to the active 
      phase of the circadian rhythm resulted in overexpression of circadian clock
      genes, such as Period 2 (Per2) at the healing callus, and increased serum levels 
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-13 (IL-13), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and
      vascular endothelial growth factor. By contrast, NSAID administration during the 
      resting phase resulted in severe bone healing impairment.

TI  - The effectiveness of substance use interventions for homeless and vulnerably
      housed persons:  A systematic review of systematic reviews on supervised
      consumption facilities, managed alcohol programs, and pharmacological agents for 
      opioid use disorder.
LID - e0227298
AB  - Background: Substance use is disproportionately high among people who are
      homeless or vulnerably housed. We performed a systematic overview of reviews
      examining the effects of selected harm reduction and pharmacological
      interventions on the health and social well-being of people who use substances,
      with a focus on homeless populations. Methods and findings: We searched MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, PsycINFO, Joanna Briggs Institute EBP, Cochrane Database of Systematic
      Reviews and DARE for systematic reviews from inception to August 2019. We
      conducted a grey literature search and hand searched reference lists. We selected
      reviews that synthesized evidence on supervised consumption facilities, managed
      alcohol programs and pharmacological interventions for opioid use disorders. We
      abstracted data specific to homeless or vulnerably housed populations. We
      assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Our search identified
      483 citations and 30 systematic reviews met all inclusion criteria, capturing the
      results from 442 primary studies. This included three reviews on supervised
      consumption facilities, 24 on pharmacological interventions, and three on managed
      alcohol programs. Supervised consumption facilities decreased lethal overdoses
      and other high risk behaviours without any significant harm, and improved access 
      to care. Pharmaceutical interventions reduced mortality, morbidity, and substance
      use, but the impact on retention in treatment, mental illness and access to care 
      was variable. Managed alcohol programs reduced or stabilized alcohol consumption.
      Few studies on managed alcohol programs reported deaths. Conclusions: Substance
      use is a common chronic condition impacting homeless populations. Supervised
      consumption facilities reduce overdose and improve access to care, while
      pharmacological interventions may play a role in reducing harms and addressing
      other morbidity. High quality evidence on managed alcohol programs is limited.

TI  - Management of veterinary anaesthesia in small animals: A survey of current
      practice in Quebec.
LID - e0227204
AB  - Objective: To describe how small animal anaesthesia is performed in
      French-speaking Eastern Canada, and the variations between practices, in
      particular based on practice type, veterinarian gender and experience. Design:
      Observational study, survey. Sample: 156 respondents. Procedure: A questionnaire 
      was designed to assess current small animal anaesthesia practices in
      French-speaking Eastern Canada, mainly in the province of Quebec. The
      questionnaire was available through SurveyMonkey, and consisted of four parts:
      demographic information about the veterinarians surveyed, evaluation and
      management of anaesthetic risk, anaesthesia procedure, monitoring and safety.
      Gender, year of graduation, and type of practice were tested as potential risk
      factors. Chi-square exact test was used to study relations between each risk
      factor, and the effect of the selected risk factor on each response of the
      survey. For ordinal data, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to maximize
      power. Results: Response rate over a period of 3 months was 20.85% (156
      respondents). Overall, the way anaesthesia is performed by most respondents does 
      not meet international guidelines, such as patient preparation and evaluation
      prior to anaesthesia, not using individualised protocols (for 41%), not obtaining
      intravenous access (12.4% use it for all their anaesthesia in cats, and 30.6% in 
      dogs), lack of patient monitoring at certain intervals for 55% of the responses, 
      and client prompted optional analgesia (for 29% of respondents). Some practices
      are more compliant than others. Among them, referral centres generally offer
      better care than general practices. Conclusions and clinical relevance: The level
      of care in anaesthesia and analgesia in practices in French-speaking Eastern
      Canada is concerning, highlighting the need for more sustained continuing
      education.

TI  - A meta-ethnography to understand the experience of living with urinary
      incontinence: ‘is it just part and parcel of life?’.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) is highly prevalent and affects the lives
      of many men and women. We aimed to conduct a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES)
      to explore the experience of living with UI and to develop a conceptual model
      that can help us to understand this experience, and the potential barriers to
      appropriate healthcare. Methods: We used the methods of meta-ethnography
      developed by Noblit and Hare and recently refined for larger studies.
      Meta-ethnography involves identifying concepts from the studies and abstracting
      these concepts into a line of argument. We searched for studies that explored the
      experience of adults with UI. We used the GRADE-CERQual framework to assess
      confidence in review findings. Results: We screened 2307 titles, 429 abstracts,
      107 full texts and included 41 studies (36 unique samples) in the synthesis. We
      organised the concepts into 26 conceptual categories, which we further abstracted
      into 6 themes: (1) Am I ill or is this normal? (2) It effects who I am and how I 
      feel; (3) I feel stigmatised, ashamed and guilty; (4) talking can be difficult
      but it can help; (5) keeping incontinence under control; (6) have I got to the
      point that I need help? Our model conceptualises living with UI as navigating
      antagonists: Is UI normal or am I ill? Do I need help or am I managing? Do I keep
      UI to myself (and manage alone) or do I tell other people (and get the support
      that I need)? Do I use control strategies that focus on concealing (avoid risky
      situations, wear pads) versus, I use strategies that focus on improving the
      bodily function to improve continence. Our model highlights the experience of
      stigma, shame and guilt which exert a pull towards concealment. Conclusions: The 
      culture of secrecy and profound sense of shame is barrier to seeking help. An
      environment which reduces the shame and stigma of UI may help people to switch
      the focus to strategies that will improve continence, rather than conceal
      incontinence.

TI  - Toxicology studies of aqueous-alcohol extracts of Harpagophytum procumbens subsp.
      procumbens (Burch.) DC.Ex Meisn. (Pedaliaceae) in female and male rats.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: A variety of medicinal products prepared from secondary tubers of
      Harpagophytum procumbens subsp. procumbens (Burch.) DC.ex Meisn. (Devil’s Claw)
      and H. zeyheri are marketed in Africa, Europe, the United States, South America
      and elsewhere, where they are used for inflammatory and musculoskeletal
      conditions such as arthritis, lower back pain, rheumatism and neuralgia, etc.
      While clinical studies conducted over the last twenty years support the general
      safety of such products, infrequent gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhea,
      nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), headache, vertigo and hypersensitivity
      (allergic) reactions (rash, hives and face swelling) have been documented.
      Sex-related differences occur in the health conditions for which Devil’s Claw
      products are used, so it is likely that usage is similarly sex-related and so
      might be side effects and potential toxicities. However toxicologic studies of
      Devil’s Claw products have been conducted primarily with male animals. To address
      this deficit, we report toxicological studies in female and male rats of several 
      H. procumbens (HP) aqueous-alcohol extracts chemically analyzed by UPLC-MS.
      Methods: Female and male Sprague Dawley rats were studied for one and three
      months in groups differing by consumption of diets without and with HP extracts
      at a 7–10-fold human equivalent dose (HED). Sera were analyzed for blood
      chemistry, and heart, liver, lung, kidney, stomach, and small and large intestine
      tissues were examined for histopathology. Treatment group differences for blood
      chemistry were analyzed by ANOVA with Dunnett’s test and significant group
      differences for endpoints with marginal distributional properties were verified
      using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Group differences for histopathology were tested
      using Chi Square analysis. Results: Significant group by sex-related differences 
      in blood chemistry were detected in both studies. Additionally, several
      sex-related differences occurred between the studies. However, significant
      histopathology effects associated with the consumption of the extracts were not
      detected. Conclusion: Toxicologic analysis of Devil’s Claw extracts cause
      significant sex-related effects in blood chemistry. However, in our judgement,
      none of the observed effects suggest serious toxicity at these doses and
      durations. Subsequent toxicologic and clinical studies of H. procumbens and other
      medicines with similar properties should explore in greater detail the basis and 
      consequences of potential sex-related effects.

TI  - Therapeutic use of cannabis and cannabinoids: an evidence mapping and appraisal
      of systematic reviews.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: Although cannabis and cannabinoids are widely used with therapeutic
      purposes, their claimed efficacy is highly controversial. For this reason,
      medical cannabis use is a broad field of research that is rapidly expanding. Our 
      objectives are to identify, characterize, appraise, and organize the current
      available evidence surrounding therapeutic use of cannabis and cannabinoids,
      using evidence maps. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library
      and CINAHL, to identify systematic reviews (SRs) published from their inception
      up to December 2017. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data
      independently. We assessed methodological quality of the included SRs using the
      AMSTAR tool. To illustrate the extent of use of medical cannabis, we organized
      the results according to identified PICO questions using bubble plots
      corresponding to different clinical scenarios. Results: A total of 44 SRs
      published between 2001 and 2017 were included in this evidence mapping with data 
      from 158 individual studies. We extracted 96 PICO questions in the following
      medical conditions: multiple sclerosis, movement disorders (e.g. Tourette
      Syndrome, Parkinson Disease), psychiatry conditions, Alzheimer disease, epilepsy,
      acute and chronic pain, cancer, neuropathic pain, symptoms related to cancer
      (e.g. emesis and anorexia related with chemotherapy), rheumatic disorders,
      HIV-related symptoms, glaucoma, and COPD. The evidence about these conditions is 
      heterogeneous regarding the conclusions and the quality of the individual primary
      studies. The quality of the SRs was moderate to high according to AMSTAR scores. 
      Conclusions: Evidence on medical uses of cannabis is broad. However, due to
      methodological limitations, conclusions were weak in most of the assessed
      comparisons. Evidence mapping methodology is useful to perform an overview of
      available research, since it is possible to systematically describe the extent
      and distribution of evidence, and to organize scattered data.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of total knee replacement in addition to non-surgical
      treatment: a 2-year outcome from a randomised trial in secondary care in Denmark.
LID - e033495
AB  - Objective: To assess the 24-month cost-effectiveness of total knee replacement
      (TKR) plus non-surgical treatment compared with non-surgical treatment with the
      option of later TKR if needed. Methods: 100 adults with moderate-to-severe knee
      osteoarthritis found eligible for TKR by an orthopaedic surgeon in secondary care
      were randomised to TKR plus 12 weeks of supervised non-surgical treatment
      (exercise, education, diet, insoles and pain medication) or to supervised
      non-surgical treatment alone. Including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) data 
      from baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, effectiveness was measured as change at 24
      months. Healthcare costs and transfer payments were derived from national
      registries. Incremental healthcare costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness
      ratios (ICERs) were calculated. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was
      conducted and the probability of cost-effectiveness was estimated at the 22 665
      Euros/QALY threshold defined by the National Institute for Health and Care
      Excellence. Results: TKR plus non-surgical treatment was more expensive (mean of 
      23 076 vs 14 514 Euros) but also more effective than non-surgical treatment (mean
      24-month improvement in QALY of 0.195 vs 0.056). While cost-effective in the
      unadjusted scenario (ICER of 18 497 Euros/QALY), TKR plus non-surgical treatment 
      was not cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of
      later TKR if needed in the adjusted (age, sex and baseline values), base-case
      scenario (ICER of 32 611 Euros/QALY) with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 
      23.2%. Including deaths, TKR plus non-surgical treatment was still not
      cost-effective (ICERs of 46 277 to 64 208 Euros/QALY). Conclusions: From a
      24-month perspective, TKR plus non-surgical treatment does not appear to be
      cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of later TKR 
      if needed in patients with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis and moderate
      intensity pain in secondary care in Denmark. Results were sensitive to changes,
      highlighting the need for further confirmatory research also assessing the
      long-term cost-effectiveness of TKR. Trial registration number:
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01410409).

TI  - Facing Facts: Facial Injuries from Stand-up Electric Scooters.
LID - e6663
AB  - BackgroundStand-up electric scooters (SES) are a popular public transportation
      method. Numerous safety concerns have arisen since their recent
      introduction.MethodsA retrospective chart review was performed to identify
      patients presenting to the emergency departments in Indianapolis, who sustained
      SES-related injuries.ResultsA total of 89 patients were included in our study.
      The average patient age was 29 ± 12.9 years in a predominantly male cohort
      (65.2%). No patient was documented as wearing a helmet during the event of
      injury. Alcohol intoxication was noted in 14.6% of accidents. Falling constituted
      the leading trauma mechanism (46.1%). Injuries were most common on Saturday
      (24.7%) from 14h00 to 21h59 (55.1%). Injury types included: abrasions/contusions 
      (33.7%), fractures (31.5%), lacerations (27.0%), or joint injuries (18.0%). The
      head and neck region (H&N) was the most frequently affected site (42.7%).
      Operative management under general anesthesia was necessary for 13.5% of
      injuries. Nonoperative management primarily included conservative orthopedic care
      (34.8%), pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      (34.8%) and/or opioids (4.5%), bedside laceration repairs (27.0%), and wound
      dressing (10.1%). Individuals sustaining head and neck injuries were more likely 
      to be older (33.8 vs. 25.7 years, p=0.003), intoxicated by alcohol (29.0% vs.
      3.9%, p=0.002), and requiring CT imaging (60.5% vs. 9.8%, p
      <0.001).ConclusionAlthough SESs provide a convenient transportation
      modality, unregulated use raises significant safety concerns. More data need to
      be collected to guide future safety regulations.

TI  - Chronic Non-Malignant Pain in Patients with Cancer Seen at a Timely Outpatient
      Palliative Care Clinic.
LID - 214
AB  - Palliative care is seeing cancer patients earlier in the disease trajectory with 
      a multitude of chronic issues. Chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) in cancer
      patients is under-studied. In this prospective study, we examined the prevalence 
      and management of CNMP in cancer patients seen at our supportive care clinic for 
      consultation. We systematically characterized each pain type with the Brief Pain 
      Inventory (BPI) and documented current treatments. The attending physician made
      the pain diagnoses according to the International Association for the Study of
      Pain (IASP) task force classification. Among 200 patients (mean age 60 years, 69%
      metastatic disease, 1-year survival of 77%), the median number of pain diagnosis 
      was 2 (IQR 1–2); 67 (34%, 95% CI 28–41%) had a diagnosis of CNMP; 133 (67%) had
      cancer-related pain; and 52 (26%) had treatment-related pain. In total, 12/31
      (39%) patients with only CNMP and 21/36 (58%) patients with CNMP and other pain
      diagnoses were on opioids. There was a total of 94 CNMP diagnoses among 67
      patients, including 37 (39%) osteoarthritis and 20 (21%) lower back pain; 30
      (32%) were treated with opioids. In summary, CNMP was common in the timely
      palliative care setting and many patients were on opioids. Our findings highlight
      the need to develop clinical guidelines for CNMP in cancer patients to
      standardize its management.

TI  - Effects of Ovariohysterectomy and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy on Systemic
      Inflammation and Oxidation in Dogs.
LID - 506
AB  - Introduction: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves breathing 100% oxygen in 
      a specialized compression chamber leading to hyperoxia. This treatment modality
      is associated with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and healing properties in
      people and laboratory animals. However, there are relatively few reports that
      evaluate the effects of HBOT in companion animals. The goal of this study was to 
      investigate the physiological effects of HBOT on surgically induced systemic
      inflammation and oxidation in dogs.Material and Methods: Twelve healthy female
      beagle dogs were spayed and randomized into control and HBOT groups (n = 6). Both
      groups received conventional post-ovariohysterectomy therapy, and the HBOT group 
      received two hyperbaric treatments at 2.0 atmosphere of absolute pressure and
      100% oxygen for 35 min, 6 and 18 h after surgery. Blood samples were collected 3 
      h prior to ovariohysterectomy, 6, 18, and 30 h after surgery, prior to HBOT when 
      applicable. Inflammatory biomarkers, including C-reactive protein, circulating
      cytokines, and changes in iron homeostasis were evaluated at each time point to
      determine the effects of surgery and HBOT on inflammation. Similarly, serum total
      oxidant status and total antioxidant status were measured to assess the oxidative
      stress. Pain and incision scores were recorded and compared between
      groups.Results: Following ovariohysterectomy, all dogs had significantly
      increased serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, KC-like, IL-6, and
      increased unsaturated iron-binding capacity compared to their pre-surgical values
      (p < 0.02), while serum iron, total iron-binding capacity and transferrin
      saturation were significantly decreased after surgery (p < 0.02). There was no
      significant difference between the control group and the HBOT group for any of
      the variables. There were no overt adverse effects in the HBOT group.Conclusion: 
      This is the first prospective randomized controlled study to investigate the
      effects of HBOT on surgically induced systemic inflammation in dogs. While
      elective ovariohysterectomy resulted in mild inflammation, the described HBOT
      protocol portrayed no outward adverse effect and did not induce any detectable
      pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, or antioxidant effects. Additional
      investigation is required to identify objective markers to quantify the response 
      to HBOT and determine its role as an adjunctive therapy in dogs with more severe,
      complicated or chronic diseases.

TI  - Healthcare Resource Use and Cost: The Impact of Adopting an Abuse-Deterrent
      Formulation of Extended Release Morphine.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - Background: Development of abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs) of prescription
      opioids (RxO) is an important step toward reducing misuse and abuse.
      Morphine-ARER (MorphaBond™ ER) is an extended-release (ER) morphine sulfate
      tablet formulated to deter misuse/abuse via intravenous (IV) and intranasal (IN) 
      routes of administration. Objective: A model was developed to estimate the budget
      impact to a hypothetical commercial health plan of 10 million members 2 years
      after adding morphine-ARER to drug formulary. Methods: We analyzed incremental
      health care resource use (HCRU) associated with RxO misuse/abuse based on a
      health plan’s RxO formulary coverage and patterns of misuse/abuse. Misuse/abuse
      rates, incremental HCRU and associated costs were based on the 2015 National
      Survey on Drug Use and Health, an analysis of claims from OptumHealth Care
      Solutions, Inc. (2013–2015) and published literature. RxO formulary shares were
      based on 2016–2017 Symphony Retail Prescription data. Morphine-ARER was assumed
      to capture 20 and 30 percent from branded and 0.3 and 0.6 percent from generic
      non-ADF ER morphine, in the first and second years, respectively. Proportions of 
      misuse/abuse deterred by physical/chemical properties of morphine-ARER were
      assumed to be 90 percent via IV and 60 percent via IN administration, with
      further IN deterrence based on results from morphine-ARER’s human abuse liability
      study. Results: Adding morphine-ARER to formulary resulted in a potential
      decrease in abuse-related healthcare costs by $557,321 (−$0.00232 per-member
      per-month [PMPM]), offsetting a pharmacy cost increase of $217,045 (+$0.00090
      PMPM), resulting in net cost-savings of $0.00142 PMPM over 2 years, based on
      certain model assumptions. Conclusion: Placing morphine-ARER on a health plan’s
      drug formulary may result in reduced misuse/abuse and overall cost savings.

TI  - Rediscovery of Ceruletide, a CCK Agonist, as an Analgesic Drug.
PG  - 123-30
AB  - Ceruletide (CRL) is a decapeptide, originating from the skin of a tropical frog, 
      and is many times more potent that cholecystokinin (CCK) in a number of assays.
      The compound was first isolated and characterized around 50 years ago, and its
      analgesic properties were subsequently identified. Since the 1980s it has been
      available in the clinic as a parenteral solution and is used as a diagnostic tool
      to characterize pancreas and gall bladder malfunctions. Its analgesic properties 
      were evaluated in a number of indications: cancer pain, burns, colic pains and
      migraine. Preclinically, CRL reduces pain in low microgram dose range and
      promotes clear and long-lasting analgesic activity in nanograms when applied
      centrally. CCK is amongst the most widely expressed neuropeptides in the brain.
      CCK-induced analgesic effects in response to persistent and inflammatory pain
      have recently been associated with CCK2 receptor signaling. CRL, a potent CCK
      agonist, might be worthwhile to rediscover as a putative analgesic drug and could
      represent a potential analgesic intrathecal strategy to patients with
      cancer-related pain.

TI  - Medical Students’ and Internal Medicine Trainees’ Knowledge of Drug Prescribing
      Recommendations in Older Patients with Impaired Kidney Function.
PG  - 53-60
AB  - Background: Numerous medications used in older adults require dose modification
      or should be avoided in individuals with impaired kidney function. Purpose: To
      assess medical students’ and physicians’ knowledge of drug prescribing
      recommendations in older patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Patients and Methods: A survey comprising a list of 64
      drugs conducted in 183 medical students (Students), and 138 post-graduate
      trainees in internal medicine (Physicians). The respondents were asked to
      classify each drug into one of three categories: 1) no renal precautions; 2) dose
      should be reduced; and 3) medication should be avoided. Results: A range of
      16.9–68.3% students and 14.5–81.2% physicians correctly classified drugs in the
      category “No renal precautions.” Drugs requiring dose reduction were correctly
      classified by 6–67.2% students, and 24.6–85.5% physicians. For drugs that should 
      be avoided in subjects with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2, the range was 6–44.8% in the
      Students, and 8.7–76.1% in the Physicians. The Physicians did better than the
      Students by classifying five drugs that do not require renal precautions, 12
      drugs requiring dose reduction, and six medications that should be avoided. The
      Students had a higher percentage of correct answers for seven drugs in the
      category “no renal precautions,” and one drug requiring dose reduction.
      Conclusion: Medical students and post-graduate trainees in internal medicine have
      poor knowledge of drug prescribing recommendations in older patients with renal
      impairment.

TI  - Case report: Successful induction of buprenorphine/naloxone using a microdosing
      schedule and assertive outreach.
LID - 2
AB  - Background: The requirement for moderate withdrawal prior to initiation can be a 
      barrier to buprenorphine/naloxone induction. Case presentation: We aimed to use a
      microdosing regimen to initiate regular dosing of buprenorphine/naloxone in a
      high-risk patient with a history of failed initiations due, in part, to
      withdrawal symptoms. Using an assertive outreach model and a
      buprenorphine/naloxone microdosing schedule, we initiated treatment of an
      individual’s opioid use disorder. There was a successful buprenorphine/naloxone
      microdosing induction as the team reached a therapeutic dose of
      buprenorphine/naloxone. Including the induction period, the medication was used
      consistently for 4 weeks. Conclusions: A microdosing schedule can be used to
      induce a patient onto buprenorphine/naloxone with no apparent withdrawal;
      gradually reducing illicit substance use. This case report builds on previous
      literature, highlighting ways to minimize barriers to induction of
      buprenorphine/naloxone, using a microdosing schedule and assertive outreach.
      Given the safety profile of buprenorphine and its potential to be a lifesaving
      intervention, a larger study of microdosing is indicated.

TI  - Association of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants use and
      falls in trauma patients: Conditional effect of age.
LID - e0227696
AB  - Introduction: The relationship between benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic
      antidepressants and trauma is of great importance because of increased
      consumption and the growing evidence of a positive association among older
      adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effect size of the
      association between the consumption of psychotropic medications /opioids and
      falls in patients who have suffered trauma by studying the role of other
      variables in this relationship. Method: From 2011 to 2016, the presence of
      benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and other drugs in 1060
      patients admitted for trauma at a level I trauma hospital was analysed.
      Multivariate models were used to measure the adjusted effect size of the
      association between consumption of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic
      antidepressants and falls, and the effect of age on this association was studied.
      Results: A total of 192 patients tested positive for benzodiazepines, opioids and
      tricyclic antidepressants, with same-level falls being the most frequent
      mechanism of injury in this group (40.1%), with an odds ratio of 1.96
      (1.40–2.75), p < 0.001. Once other covariates were introduced, this association
      was not observed, leaving only age, gender (woman) and, to a lesser extent,
      sensory conditions as variables associated with falls. Age acted as an effect
      modifier between benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and
      falls, with significant effect sizes starting at 51.9 years of age. Conclusions: 
      The association between the consumption of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic
      antidepressants and falls in patients admitted for trauma is conditioned by other
      confounding variables, with age being the most influential confounding variable.

AB  - Background: Medical overuse is a common problem in health care. Preventing
      unnecessary medicine is one of the main tasks of General Practice, so called
      quaternary prevention. We aimed to capture the current opinion of German General 
      Practitioners (GPs) to medical overuse. Methods: A quantitative online study was 
      conducted. The questionnaire was developed based on a qualitative study and
      literature search. GPs were asked to estimate prevalence of medical overuse as
      well as to evaluate drivers and solutions of medical overuse. GPs in Bavaria were
      recruited via email (750 addresses). A descriptive data analysis was performed.
      Additionally the association between doctors’ attitudes and (1) demographic
      variables and (2) interest in campaigns against medical overuse was assessed.
      Results: Response rate was 18%. The mean age was 54 years, 79% were male and 68% 
      have worked as GP longer than 15 years. Around 38% of medical services were
      considered as medical overuse and nearly half of the GPs (47%) judged medical
      overuse to be the more important problem than medical underuse. Main drivers were
      seen in “patients´ expectations” (76%), “lack of a primary care system” (61%) and
      “defensive medicine” (53%), whereas “disregard of evidence/guidelines” (15%) and 
      “economic pressure on the side of the doctor” (13%) were not weighted as
      important causes. Demographic variables did not have an important impact on GPs´ 
      response pattern. GPs interested in campaigns like “Choosing Wisely” showed a
      higher awareness for medical overuse, although these campaigns were only known by
      50% of the respondents. Discussion: Medical overuse is an important issue for
      GPs. Main drivers were searched and found outside their own sphere of
      responsibility. Campaigns as “Choosing Wisely” seem to have a positive effect on 
      GPs attitude, but knowledge is still limited.

TI  - Estimating the impact of drug use on US mortality, 1999-2016.
LID - e0226732
AB  - The impact of rising drug use on US mortality may extend beyond deaths coded as
      drug-related to include excess mortality from other causes affected by drug use. 
      Here, we estimate the full extent of drug-associated mortality. We use annual
      death rates for 1999–2016 by state, sex, five-year age group, and cause of death 
      to model the relationship between drug-coded mortality—which serves as an
      indicator of the population-level prevalence of drug use—and mortality from other
      causes. Among residents aged 15–64 living in the 50 US states, the estimated
      number of drug-associated deaths in 2016 (141,695) was 2.2 times the number of
      drug-coded deaths (63,000). Adverse trends since 2010 in midlife mortality are
      largely attributable to drug-associated mortality. In the absence of drug use, we
      estimate that the probability of dying between ages 15 and 65 would have
      continued to decline after 2010 among men (to 15% in 2016) and would have
      remained at a low level (10%) among women. Our results suggest that an additional
      3.9% of men and 1.8% of women died between ages 15 and 65 in 2016 because of drug
      use. In terms of life expectancy beyond age 15, we estimate that drug use cost
      men 1.4 years and women 0.7 years, on average. In the hardest-hit state (West
      Virginia), drug use cost men 3.6 and women 1.9 life years. Recent declines in US 
      life expectancy have been blamed largely on the drug epidemic. Consistent with
      that inference, our results imply that, in the absence of drug use, life
      expectancy at age 15 would have increased slightly between 2014 and 2016.
      Drug-associated mortality in the US is roughly double that implied by drug-coded 
      deaths alone. The drug epidemic is exacting a heavy cost to American lives, not
      only from overdoses but from a variety of causes.

TI  - High-frequency spinal cord stimulation at 10 kHz for the treatment of painful
      diabetic neuropathy: design of a multicenter, randomized controlled trial
      (SENZA-PDN).
LID - 87
AB  - Background: Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), a debilitating and progressive
      chronic pain condition that significantly impacts quality of life, is one of the 
      common complications seen with long-standing diabetes mellitus. Neither
      pharmacological treatments nor low-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has
      provided significant and long-term pain relief for patients with PDN. This study 
      aims to document the value of 10-kHz SCS in addition to conventional medical
      management (CMM) compared with CMM alone in patients with refractory PDN.
      Methods: In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (SENZA-PDN), 
      216 subjects with PDN will be assigned 1:1 to receive 10-kHz SCS combined with
      CMM or CMM alone after appropriate institutional review board approvals and
      followed for 24 months. Key inclusion criteria include (1) symptoms of PDN for at
      least 12 months, (2) average pain intensity of at least 5 cm—on a 0- to 10-cm
      visual analog scale (VAS)—in the lower limbs, and (3) an appropriate candidate
      for SCS. Key exclusion criteria include (1) large or gangrenous ulcers or (2)
      average pain intensity of at least 3 cm on VAS in the upper limbs or both. Along 
      with pain VAS, neurological assessments, health-related quality of life, sleep
      quality, and patient satisfaction will be captured. The primary endpoint
      comparing responder rates (≥50% pain relief) and safety rates between the
      treatment groups will be assessed at 3 months. Several secondary endpoints will
      also be reported on. Discussion: Enrollment commenced in 2017 and was completed
      in 2019. This study will help to determine whether 10-kHz SCS improves clinical
      outcomes and health-related quality of life and is a cost-effective treatment for
      PDN that is refractory to CMM. Trial registration: ClincalTrials.gov identifier: 
      NCT03228420 (registered 24 July 2017).

TI  - De novo variants in exomes of congenital heart disease patients identify risk
      genes and pathways.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects ~ 1% of live births and is the
      most common birth defect. Although the genetic contribution to the CHD has been
      long suspected, it has only been well established recently. De novo variants are 
      estimated to contribute to approximately 8% of sporadic CHD. Methods: CHD is
      genetically heterogeneous, making pathway enrichment analysis an effective
      approach to explore and statistically validate CHD-associated genes. In this
      study, we performed novel gene and pathway enrichment analyses of high-impact de 
      novo variants in the recently published whole-exome sequencing (WES) data
      generated from a cohort of CHD 2645 parent-offspring trios to identify new
      CHD-causing candidate genes and mutations. We performed rigorous variant- and
      gene-level filtrations to identify potentially damaging variants, followed by
      enrichment analyses and gene prioritization. Results: Our analyses revealed 23
      novel genes that are likely to cause CHD, including HSP90AA1, ROCK2, IQGAP1, and 
      CHD4, and sharing biological functions, pathways, molecular interactions, and
      properties with known CHD-causing genes. Conclusions: Ultimately, these findings 
      suggest novel genes that are likely to be contributing to CHD pathogenesis.

TI  - Ozone Therapy for Oral Palatal Ulcer in a Leukaemic Patient.
LID - 001406
AB  - Chemotherapy usually causes complications affecting several tissues such as oral 
      mucosa. In this case report, a soft palate oral ulcer caused by chemotherapy was 
      treated by ozone gas. This kind of treatment is known for its antimicrobial,
      regenerative and analgesic proprieties. The results show a complete resolution of
      the lesion within 2 weeks of treatment. Ozone therapy demonstrates greater
      effectiveness with respect to this kind of oral lesion compared to traditional
      therapy. Considering this evidence, ozone therapy should be considered as a
      useful tool for the adjuvant therapy of oral complications in oncologic
      patients.LEARNING POINTS: Intensive chemotherapy can have side effects,
      particularly affecting tissue with higher turnover. Therefore, there is a
      clinical need to prevent or to treat such complications.Ozone therapy could
      improve oral mucosa healing and have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
      antibacterial effects to prevent suprainfections. To date, there are no reported 
      cases of oral ulcers in oncologic patients being completely resolved using ozone 
      in the literature.Medical and dental doctors should collaborate with regards to
      complex patients to prevent such types of complications, discovering these
      clinical cases that are unknown in the literature and treating patients in a more
      comprehensive way.

TI  - Hepatitis C Virus Prevalence in 50 U.S. States and D.C. by Sex, Birth Cohort, and
      Race: 2013‐2016.
PG  - 355-70
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver‐related morbidity
      and mortality, and more than 2 million adults in the United States are estimated 
      to be currently infected. Reducing HCV burden will require an understanding of
      demographic disparities and targeted efforts to reduce prevalence in populations 
      with disproportionate disease rates. We modeled state‐level estimates of
      hepatitis C prevalence among U.S. adults by sex, birth cohort, and race during
      2013‐2016. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data were used in
      combination with state‐level HCV‐related and narcotic overdose–related mortality 
      data from the National Vital Statistics System and estimates from external
      literature review on populations not sampled in the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey. Nationally, estimated hepatitis C prevalence was 1.3% among
      males and 0.6% among females (prevalence ratio [PR] = 2.3). Among persons born
      during 1945 to 1969, prevalence was 1.6% compared with 0.5% among persons born
      after 1969 (PR = 3.2). Among persons born during 1945 to 1969, prevalence ranged 
      from 0.7% in North Dakota to 3.6% in Oklahoma and 6.8% in the District of
      Columbia. Among persons born after 1969, prevalence was more than twice as high
      in Kentucky, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and West Virginia compared with the national
      average. Hepatitis C prevalence was 1.8% among non‐Hispanic black persons and
      0.8% among persons of other races (PR = 2.2), and the magnitude of this disparity
      varied widely across jurisdictions (PR range: 1.3‐7.8). Overall, 23% of prevalent
      HCV infections occurred among non‐Hispanic black persons, whereas 12% of the
      population was represented by this racial group. These estimates provide
      information on prevalent HCV infections that jurisdictions can use for
      understanding and monitoring local disease patterns and racial disparities in
      burden of disease.

TI  - Effect of Inflammation on Female Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Neurons:
      Mechanisms and Consequences.
LID - 529
AB  - Inflammation has a well-known suppressive effect on fertility. The function of
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, the central regulator of fertility
      is substantially altered during inflammation in females. In our review we discuss
      the latest results on how the function of GnRH neurons is modified by
      inflammation in females. We first address the various effects of inflammation on 
      GnRH neurons and their functional consequences. Second, we survey the possible
      mechanisms underlying the inflammation-induced actions on GnRH neurons. The role 
      of several factors will be discerned in transmitting inflammatory signals to the 
      GnRH neurons: cytokines, kisspeptin, RFamide-related peptides, estradiol and the 
      anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway. Since aging and obesity are both
      characterized by reproductive decline our review also focuses on the mechanisms
      and pathophysiological consequences of the impact of inflammation on GnRH neurons
      in aging and obesity.

TI  - Understanding the Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Pathogenesis of Arthritis
      Pain Using Animal Models.
LID - 533
AB  - Arthritis, including osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is the
      leading cause of years lived with disability (YLD) worldwide. Although pain is
      the cardinal symptom of arthritis, which is directly related to function and
      quality of life, the elucidation of the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of 
      pain in arthritis has lagged behind other areas, such as inflammation control and
      regulation of autoimmunity. The lack of therapeutics for optimal pain management 
      is partially responsible for the current epidemic of opioid and narcotic abuse.
      Recent advances in animal experimentation and molecular biology have led to
      significant progress in our understanding of arthritis pain. Despite the inherent
      problems in the extrapolation of data gained from animal pain studies to
      arthritis in human patients, the critical assessment of molecular mediators and
      translational studies would help to define the relevance of novel therapeutic
      targets for the treatment of arthritis pain. This review discusses biological and
      molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of arthritis pain determined in 
      animal models of OA and RA, along with the methodologies used.

TI  - Predicting high-risk opioid prescriptions before they are given.
PG  - 1917-23
AB  - We describe a hypothetical preventative policy solution to address the opioid
      crisis using an integrated administrative database developed in collaboration
      with the State of Rhode Island. Machine learning algorithms trained on
      observations of past opioid prescription accurately predict adverse
      opioid-related outcomes among Medicaid recipients even before their initial
      opioid prescription is written. Although these models are limited to individuals 
      who have been selected for opioid prescription, they suggest a feasible path
      forward for using administrative data to inform prescription risk. Under the
      assumption that the cost of diverting individuals from opioid therapy to an
      alternative therapy is homogenous across individuals, we simulate a hypothetical 
      policy for restricting opioid prescriptions based on risk that is likely
      net-beneficial given current cost estimates.

TI  - Comparison of Sufentanil- and Fentanyl-based Intravenous Patient-controlled
      Analgesia on Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting after Laparoscopic Nephrectomy: A 
      Prospective, Double-blind, Randomized-controlled Trial.
PG  - 207-13
AB  - Background: The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remains
      high. The effects of sufentanil for PONV is not firmly confirmed. The aim of this
      study was to compare the effect of sufentanil- and fentanyl-based intravenous
      patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) on the incidence of PONV after laparoscopic
      nephrectomy.Methods: Eighty-six patients were randomly allocated to receive
      either the sufentanil (n =43) or fentanyl (n =43). IV-PCA was prepared using
      either sufentanil 3 µg/kg or fentanyl 20 µg/kg, ramosetron 0.3 mg, and ketorolac 
      120 mg. The primary outcome of was the incidence of PONV during 24 h after post
      anesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge. The secondary outcomes were the modified
      Rhodes index and patient satisfaction scores at 24 h after PACU discharge, need
      for rescue antiemetics, pain score, need for additional analgesics, and
      cumulative consumption of IV-PCAResults: The incidence of PONV was comparable
      between the sufentanil and fentanyl groups (64.3% vs. 65%, p = 0.946;
      respectively). The number of patients who required antiemetics (p = 0.946) and
      the modified Rhodes index at 24 h after post-anesthesia care unit discharge (p = 
      0.668) were also comparable in both groups. No significant differences were found
      in the secondary outcomes, including the analgesic profiles and adverse events
      between the groups.Conclusions: In conclusion, sufentanil- and fentanyl-based
      IV-PCA showed similar incidence of PONV with comparable analgesic effects after
      laparoscopic nephrectomy. Based on these results, we suggest that sufentanil and 
      fentanyl may provide comparable effects for IV-PCA after laparoscopic
      nephrectomy.

TI  - Anticipatory Behavior for a Mealworm Reward in Laying Hens Is Reduced by Opioid
      Receptor Antagonism but Not Standard Feed Intake.
LID - 290
AB  - It is widely accepted that the absence of suffering no longer defines animal
      welfare and that positive affective experiences are imperative. For example,
      laying hens may be housed in environments that do not cause chronic stress but
      may lack particular resources that promote positive affective experiences, such
      as conspecifics or effective enrichment. Despite a consensus of how important
      positive affect is for animal welfare, they are difficult to identify
      objectively. There is a need for valid and reliable indicators of positive
      affect. Pharmacological interventions can be an effective method to provide
      insight into affective states and can assist with the investigation of novel
      indicators such as associated biomarkers. We aimed to validate a pharmacological 
      intervention that blocks the subjective hedonistic phase associated with reward
      in laying hens via the administration of the non-selective (μ, δ, and κ) opioid
      receptor antagonist, nalmafene. We hypothesized that nonfood deprived, hens that 
      did not experience a positive affective state when presented with a mealworm food
      reward due to the administration of nalmefene, would show minimal anticipatory
      and consummatory behavior when the same food reward was later presented. Hens (n 
      = 80) were allocated to treatment groups, receiving either nalmefene or vehicle
      (0.9% saline) once or twice daily, for four consecutive days. An anticipatory
      test (AT) was performed on all days 30 min post-drug administration. Behavioral
      responses during the appetitive and consummatory phase were assessed on days 1, 3
      and 4. Anticipatory behavior did not differ between treatment groups the first
      time hens were provided with mealworm food rewards. However, antagonism of opioid
      receptors reduced anticipatory and consummatory behavior on days 3 and 4. Feed
      intake of standard layer mash was not impacted by treatment, thus nalmefene
      reduced non-homeostatic food consumption but not homeostatic consumption.
      Behavioral observations during the AT provided no evidence that nalmefene treated
      hens were fearful, sedated or nauseous. The results suggest that we successfully 
      blocked the hedonistic subjective component of reward in laying hens and provide 
      evidence that this method could be used to investigate how hens perceive their
      environment and identify associated novel indicators to assess hen welfare.

TI  - Dopamine D3 Receptor Antagonism Reverses the Escalation of Oxycodone
      Self-administration and Decreases Withdrawal-Induced Hyperalgesia and
      Irritability-Like Behavior in Oxycodone-Dependent Heterogeneous Stock Rats.
LID - 292
AB  - Prescription opioids, such as oxycodone, are highly effective analgesics for
      clinical pain management, but approximately 25% of patients who are prescribed
      opioids misuse them, and 5%–10% develop an opioid use disorder (OUD). Effective
      therapies for the prevention and treatment of opioid abuse and addiction need to 
      be developed. The present study evaluated the effects of the highly selective
      dopamine D3 receptor antagonist VK4-116
      ([R]-N-[4-(4-[3-chloro-5-ethyl-2-methoxyphenyl]piperazin-1-yl)-3-hydroxybutyl]-1H
      -indole-2-carboxamide) on oxycodone addictive-like behaviors. We used a model of 
      extended access to oxycodone self-administration and tested the effects of
      VK4-116 on the escalation of oxycodone self-administration and withdrawal-induced
      hyperalgesia and irritability-like behavior in male and female rats. Pretreatment
      with VK4-116 (5–25 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently decreased the escalation of
      oxycodone self-administration and reduced withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia and
      irritability-like behavior in opioid-dependent rats. These findings demonstrate a
      key role for D3 receptors in both the motivation to take opioids and negative
      emotional states that are associated with opioid withdrawal and suggest that D3
      receptor antagonism may be a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of
      OUD.

TI  - Palliative care for patients with substance use disorder and multiple problems: a
      qualitative study on experiences of healthcare professionals, volunteers and
      experts-by-experience.
LID - 8
AB  - Background: There is little information about how healthcare professionals feel
      about providing palliative care for patients with a substance use disorder (SUD).
      Therefore, this study aims to explore: 1) the problems and needs experienced by
      healthcare professionals, volunteers and experts-by-experience (HCP/VE) during
      their work with patients with SUD in a palliative care trajectory and; 2) to make
      suggestions for improvements using the quality of care model by Donabedian
      (Structure, Process, Outcome). Methods: A qualitative study was conducted,
      consisting of six focus group interviews which consisted of HCP/VE working with
      patients with SUD in a palliative care phase. At the end of the focus group
      interviews, participants structured and summarized their experiences within a
      Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) framework. Interview
      transcripts (other than the SWOT) were analysed by the researchers following
      procedures from the Grounded Theory Approach (‘Grounded Theory Lite’).
      SWOT-findings were not subjected to in-depth analysis. Results: HCP/VE stated
      that within the Structure of care, care networks are fragmented and HCP/VE often 
      lack knowledge about patients’ multiplicity of problems and the time to unravel
      these. Communication with this patient group appears limited. The actual
      care-giving Process requires HCP/VE a lot of creativity and time spent seeking
      for cooperation with other caregivers and appropriate care settings. The latter
      is often hindered by stigma. Since no formalized knowledge is available,
      care-delivery is often exclusively experience-based. Pain-medication is often
      ineffective due to active substance use. Finally, several Outcomes were brought
      forward: Firstly, a palliative care phase is often identified only at a late
      stage. Secondly, education and a (mobile) team of expertise are desired. Thirdly,
      care for the caregivers themselves is often de-prioritized. Conclusions: Better
      integration and collaboration between the different professionals with extensive 
      experience in addiction, palliative and general curative care is imperative to
      assure good palliative care for patients with SUD. Currently, the resources for
      this care appear to be insufficient. Development of an educational program and
      social mapping may be the first steps in improving palliative care for patients
      with severe SUD.

      retrospective cohort study.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Pain is a common and burdensome complication in patients with acute
      stroke. We assessed the impact of impaired communication in stroke patients on
      pain assessment and treatment. Methods: We included 909 (507 male, mean age
      71.8 years) patients admitted to our stroke unit from 01/2015 to 12/2015 in the
      analysis. Patients were assigned to four groups: able to communicate (AC), not
      able to communicate prior to index stroke (P-NAC), due to focal symptoms of index
      stroke (S-NAC), due to a reduced level of consciousness (C-NAC). Pain prevalence,
      documentation of pain and use of analgesics were evaluated. C-NAC patients were
      excluded from analyses regarding analgesic treatment due to relevant differences 
      in patient characteristics. Results: 746 patients (82.1%) were classified as AC, 
      25 (2.8%) as P-NAC, 90 (9.9%) as S-NAC and 48 (5.3%) as C-NAC. Pain was
      documented on the Numeric Rating Scale and in form of free text by nurses and
      physicians. Nurses documented pain more frequently than physicians (p < 0.001).
      Pain prevalence was 47.0% (n.s. between groups). The use of analgesic medication 
      increased from 48.7% in the AC group, to 76.0% in the P-NAC group, and 77.8% in
      the S-NAC group (p < 0.001). Opioid use was significantly more frequent in NAC
      patients (p < 0.001). The response to the treatment was poorly documented with
      significantly lowest rates in S-NAC patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study 
      suggests that post-stroke pain in patients with inability to communicate is not
      attended enough, not systematically assessed and therefore not sufficiently
      treated.

TI  - The Value Proposition for Pathologists: A Population Health Approach.
LID - 2374289519898857
AB  - The transition to a value-based payment system offers pathologists the
      opportunity to play an increased role in population health by improving outcomes 
      and safety as well as reducing costs. Although laboratory testing itself accounts
      for a small portion of health-care spending, laboratory data have significant
      downstream effects in patient management as well as diagnosis. Pathologists
      currently are heavily engaged in precision medicine, use of laboratory and
      pathology test results (including autopsy data) to reduce diagnostic errors, and 
      play leading roles in diagnostic management teams. Additionally, pathologists can
      use aggregate laboratory data to monitor the health of populations and improve
      health-care outcomes for both individual patients and populations. For the
      profession to thrive, pathologists will need to focus on extending their roles
      outside the laboratory beyond the traditional role in the analytic phase of
      testing. This should include leadership in ensuring correct ordering and
      interpretation of laboratory testing and leadership in population health
      programs. Pathologists in training will need to learn key concepts in informatics
      and data analytics, health-care economics, public health, implementation science,
      and health systems science. While these changes may reduce reimbursement for the 
      traditional activities of pathologists, new opportunities arise for value
      creation and new compensation models. This report reviews these opportunities for
      pathologist leadership in utilization management, precision medicine, reducing
      diagnostic errors, and improving health-care outcomes.

TI  - A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial to compare body weight-adjusted and
      fixed doses of palonosetron for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting in
      obese female patients.
LID - e0227490
AB  - Background: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common postsurgical
      complication. Palonosetron is effective for PONV prevention at the usual dose of 
      75 μg, but the ideal dose for obese patients has not yet been investigated. The
      aim of this study was to compare body weight-adjusted and fixed doses of
      palonosetron for preventing PONV in obese female patients. Materials and methods:
      We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial involving 80 female
      patients, aged 18–80 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical
      status of 2 and 3 and a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg m-2 who were scheduled to
      undergo elective breast surgery. Patients received an intravenous body
      weight-adjusted dose of palonosetron (1 μg kg -1, GI = 40 patients) or a fixed
      dose of palonosetron (75 μg, GII = 40 patients). All patients received
      dexamethasone (4 mg). The incidence of PONV, complete response rate (CR),
      severity of nausea and need for rescue antiemetics and analgesics were assessed
      at: 0–1 h, 1–6 h, 6–24 h and 24–48 h postoperatively. Results: The mean (± SD)
      BMI was 35.0 (±5.2) kg m-2 for GI and 35.7 (±3.6) kg m-2 for GII. There was no
      significant difference between groups in PONV incidence, CR, severity of nausea, 
      and need for rescue antiemetics or analgesics. The incidence of PONV for GI and
      GII was 15% and 27.5%, respectively, during the first 48 h (P = 0.17).
      Conclusions: A body weight-adjusted dose of palonosetron was as effective as 75
      μg for preventing PONV for 48 h in obese female patients who underwent breast
      surgery. Hence, the fixed dose may be preferable to the body weight-adjusted
      dose.

TI  - COPD and asthma in patients with opioid dependency: a cross-sectional study in
      primary care.
LID - 4
AB  - Patients treated for drug addiction have high asthma and COPD prevalence rates.
      The relative contributions of cigarette smoking, smoking intensity and possible
      smoking of other substances has not been described. We aimed to describe the
      prevalence and determinants of asthma and COPD in patients prescribed methadone
      as opioid substitution therapy (OST). In a cross-sectional study of an anonymised
      patient-level primary care dataset of UK inner-city general practices (n = 46),
      321,395 patients aged ≥18 years were identified. A total of 676 (0.21%) had a
      record of a methadone ever issued in primary care. The association between
      respiratory disease and methadone prescribing was examined using logistic
      regression. Models were adjusted for potential effects of clustering by practice.
      A total of 97.3% of patients prescribed methadone were cigarette smokers, either 
      current (81.2%) or ex-smokers (16.1%). The prevalences of asthma and COPD were
      higher in methadone patients (14.2% and 12.4%, respectively) compared to
      non-methadone patients (4.4% and 1.1%, respectively). Methadone was an
      independent determinant of asthma, adjusting for smoking status (OR 3.21; 95% CI:
      2.52, 4.10) or for smoking intensity (3.08; 2.27, 4.19), and of COPD, adjusting
      for smoking status (6.00; 4.61, 7.80) or for smoking intensity (5.80; 4.12,
      8.17). COPD and asthma prevalence were substantially higher in those prescribed
      methadone compared to those never prescribed methadone. Prescription of methadone
      was an independent predictor for both COPD and asthma, even after adjustment for 
      smoking status and smoking intensity. Possible explanations include confounding
      by association with smoking of heroin or crack cocaine, both of which may have a 
      causal association with COPD and asthma.

LID - 24
AB  - Background: Bone marrow mononuclear cells have been successfully utilized for
      numerous regenerative purposes. In the current study, patients suffering from
      erectile dysfunction (ED) unresponsive to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors were
      administered autologous bone marrow concentrate delivered intracavernously
      utilizing a point of care FDA cleared medical device. Methods: A total of 40
      patients were treated in the primary trial and 100 in the clinical registry, with
      the longest follow up of 12 months. Results: Minimal treatment associated adverse
      effects where observed related to short term bruising at the site of harvest or
      injection. No long-term adverse events were noted related to the intervention.
      Mean improvements in IIEF-5 score were 2 in the Caverstem 1.0 low dose group, 3
      in the high dose Caverstem 1.0 group and 9 in the Caverstem 2.0 group.
      Furthermore, improvements peaked by 3 months and maintained at 6 months
      follow-up. Conclusion: These data support the safety and efficacy of point of
      care, minimally to non-manipulated, non-expanded bone marrow concentrate for the 
      treatment of ED.Trial registration Funded by Creative Medical Health, Inc.;

TI  - Issues Impacting Adverse Event Frequency and Severity: Differences Between
      Randomized Phase 2 and Phase 3 Clinical Trials for Lasmiditan.
PG  - 576-88
AB  - Objective: We explore factors that may have contributed to differences in
      treatment‐emergent adverse events in the phase 2 and phase 3 lasmiditan clinical 
      trials. Background: Phase 2 and phase 3 trials showed that the centrally
      penetrant 5‐HT1F agonist, lasmiditan, was effective; higher frequency and
      severity of adverse events (AEs) were seen in phase 2. Methods: This work
      represents a hybrid of a review of primary documents and study reports with
      additional post hoc analyses. Protocols, informed consents, data collection
      forms, and methodologies were reviewed. This information was supplemented by
      results from the clinical study reports and post hoc analyses of individual
      patient data from each trial. Results: For lasmiditan 100 and 200 mg, in phase 2,
      the incidence of ≥1 AE was 72‐86% (26% severe), while in phase 3 was 36‐43% (2%
      severe). The most common AEs in all studies were CNS‐related. The phase 2 consent
      form was more descriptive of AEs than phase 3. In phase 2, patients recorded AEs 
      and severity in a paper diary that warned about drowsiness and dizziness. In
      phase 3, patients recorded in electronic diaries whether they experienced unusual
      feelings after dosing with lasmiditan that they had not felt with a migraine
      before, and were contacted to determine if an AE had occurred. In phase 2, the AE
      Schwindel was variably translated from German as “vertigo” or “dizziness,” while 
      phase 3 vertigo cases were queried to ensure there was a sensation of rotation or
      movement. History of recurrent dizziness and/or vertigo was exclusionary in phase
      3. Conclusions: This work illustrates how informed consent wording, AE collection
      methods, translation, exclusion criteria, and other factors may be important
      determinants for reporting of the frequency and severity of AEs in clinical
      trials.

TI  - Long-Term Efficacy of Safinamide on Symptoms Severity and Quality of Life in
      Fluctuating Parkinson’s Disease Patients.
PG  - 89-97
AB  - Background:: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by a wide range of motor
      and non-motor symptoms. Levodopa is still the most effective drug; however, its
      long-term use is associated with motor complications which may deteriorate
      patient’s quality of life. Safinamide is a unique treatment modulating both
      dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. Previous results from two six months,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled studies demonstrated that safinamide has
      positive effects on both motor functions and quality of life in PD patients.
      Objective:: To investigate the effects of safinamide 100 mg/day over two-year
      treatment on PD symptoms severity and quality of life, using data from the study 
      018. Methods:: Data from 352 patients were analyzed to evaluate the effects of
      safinamide on OFF time and ON time (with no or non-troublesome dyskinesia) in the
      overall population and in subgroups of patients (receiving levodopa monotherapy
      or with other anti-Parkinson therapies), and the effects of safinamide on motor
      symptoms/clinical fluctuations (by means of UPDRS III and IV) and on
      health-related quality of life (using UPDRS II and PDQ-39 summary index score).
      Results:: Safinamide, administered as add-on to standard therapy in fluctuating
      PD patients, significantly improved motor symptoms and clinical fluctuations in
      the overall population and in some subgroups of patients. Additionally,
      safinamide improved quality of life and activities of daily living, maintaining
      the efficacy in the long-term. Conclusions:: The findings of these analyses
      suggest that safinamide may be considered an appropriate adjunct therapy in
      patient not sufficiently controlled. Further investigations are desirable to
      confirm these results in usual care setting.

TI  - Avocado–Soybean Unsaponifiables: A Panoply of Potentialities to Be Exploited.
LID - 130
AB  - Avocado and soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) constitute vegetable extracts made from
      fruits and seeds of avocado and soybean oil. Characterized by its potent
      anti-inflammatory effects, this ASU mixture is recommended to act as an adjuvant 
      treatment for osteoarthritic pain and slow-acting symptomatic treatment of hip
      and knee osteoarthritis; autoimmune diseases; diffuse scleroderma and
      scleroderma-like states (e.g., morphea, sclerodactyly, scleroderma in bands).
      Besides, it was reported that it can improve the mood and quality of life of
      postmenopausal women in reducing menopause-related symptoms. This article aims to
      summarize the studies on biological effects of the avocado–soybean
      unsaponifiable, its chemical composition, pharmacotherapy as well as applications
      in autoimmune, osteoarticular and menopausal disorders. Finally, we will also
      discuss on its safety, toxicological and regulatory practices.

TI  - Continuous Fentanyl Background Infusion Regimen Optimised by Patient-Controlled
      Analgesia for Acute Postoperative Pain Management: A Randomised Controlled Trial.
LID - 211
AB  - Owing to a lack of studies investigating the effect of adjustments in fentanyl
      background infusion (BI) with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) on postoperative
      analgesia, we evaluated three BI regimens with fentanyl PCA for acute
      postoperative pain management. This randomised controlled trial enrolled 105
      patients, who were assigned to three parallel groups: constant rate BI of 2 mL/h 
      (CRBI group); time-scheduled decremental BI of 6, 2 and 1 mL/h (TDBI group); and 
      BI rates optimised to the demand of PCA (POBI group). The incidence of
      insufficient analgesia, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score and side effects
      were evaluated. The incidence of insufficient analgesia in the post-anaesthesia
      care unit was lower in the TDBI and POBI groups than the CRBI group. Incidence of
      insufficient analgesia in the ward was lower in the POBI group than the CRBI
      group. Postoperative VAS scores were significantly lower in the TDBI and POBI
      groups for up to 4 h and 24 h, respectively, compared with the CRBI group. Side
      effects and infused fentanyl dose were highest in the CRBI group. Adjusting BI
      rate based on time or patient demands could improve postoperative analgesia and
      reduce side effects. Compared to a constant BI rate, PCA-optimised BI achieved
      higher patient satisfaction.

TI  - Design of a randomized controlled trial to Link Infectious and Narcology Care
      (LINC-II) in St. Petersburg, Russia.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: If Russia is to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 HIV targets, better
      approaches to engage, effectively treat, and retain patients in care are needed. 
      This paper describes the protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing 
      the effectiveness of LINC-II, a strength-based case management program for
      HIV-positive people who inject drugs (PWID) to increase rates of HIV viral
      suppression, ART initiation, and opioid abstinence. Methods: This RCT will enroll
      and randomize 240 participants, recruited from a narcology (addiction care)
      hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. Participants are randomized to the
      intervention or control arms. Those in the intervention arm receive: (1)
      strengths-based HIV case management supporting coordinated care; (2) rapid ART
      initiation; and (3) pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder. We will evaluate the
      intervention’s effectiveness compared to standard of care on the following
      outcomes: (1) undetectable HIV viral load at 12 months (primary); (2) initiation 
      of ART within 28 days of randomization; (3) change in CD4 count from baseline to 
      12 months; (4) retention in HIV care (i.e., ≥ 1 visit to medical care in 2
      consecutive 6 month periods); (5) undetectable HIV viral load at 6 months; and
      (6) past 30-day opioid abstinence (at 6 and at 12 months). Discussion: This RCT
      will assess the LINC-II intervention in an urban Russian setting. If effective,
      it will offer a new approach for increasing the uptake of both HIV and opioid use
      disorder treatment and coordination of these modalities in standard Eastern
      European clinical settings.Trial registration This study was registered with
      ClinicalTrials.gov through the National Institutes of Health, NCT03290391.

TI  - A rapid access to addiction medicine clinic facilitates treatment of substance
      use disorder and reduces substance use.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: Substance use is prevalent in Canada, yet treatment is inaccessible. 
      The Rapid Access to Addiction Medicine (RAAM) clinic opened at the University
      Health Network (UHN) in January 2018 as part of a larger network of addictions
      clinics in Toronto, Ontario, to enable timely, low barrier access to medical
      treatment for substance use disorder (SUD). Patients attend on a walk-in basis
      without requiring an appointment or referral. We describe the RAAM clinic model, 
      including referral patterns, patient demographics and substance use patterns.
      Secondary outcomes include retention in treatment and changes in both
      self-reported and objective substance use. Methods: The Electronic Medical Record
      at the clinic was reviewed for the first 26 weeks of the clinic’s operation. We
      identified SUD diagnoses, referral source, medications prescribed, retention in
      care and self-reported substance use. Results: The clinic saw 64 unique patients:
      66% had alcohol use disorder (AUD), 39% had opiate use disorder (OUD) and 20% had
      stimulant use disorder. Fifty-five percent of patients were referred from primary
      care providers, 30% from the emergency department and 11% from withdrawal
      management services. Forty-two percent remained on-going patients, 23% were
      discharged to other care and 34% were lost to follow-up. Gabapentin (39%),
      naltrexone (39%), and acamprosate (15%) were most frequently prescribed for AUD. 
      Patients with AUD reported a significant decrease in alcohol consumption at their
      most recent visit. Most patients (65%) with OUD were prescribed buprenorphine,
      and most patients with OUD (65%) had a negative urine screen at their most recent
      visit. Conclusion: The RAAM model provides low-barrier, accessible outpatient
      care for patients with substance use disorder and facilitates the prescription of
      evidence-based pharmacotherapy for AUD and OUD. Patients referred by their
      primary care physician and the emergency department demonstrated a reduction in
      median alcohol consumption and high rates of opioid abstinence.

TI  - Factors predicting one-year post-surgical mortality amongst older Asian patients 
      undergoing moderate to major non-cardiac surgery – a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 11
AB  - Background: While short-term perioperative outcomes have been well studied in
      Western surgical populations, the aim of this study is to look at the one-year
      perioperative mortality and its associated factors in an Asian surgical
      population after non-cardiac surgery. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of
      2163 patients aged above 45 undergoing non-cardiac surgery in a
      university-affiliated tertiary hospital from January to July 2015 was performed. 
      Relevant demographic, clinical and surgical data were analysed to elicit their
      relationship to mortality at one year after surgery. A univariate analysis was
      first performed to identify significant variables with p-values ≤ 0.2, which were
      then analysed using Firth multiple logistic regression to calculate the adjusted 
      odds ratio. Results: The one-year mortality in our surgical population was 5.9%. 
      The significant factors that increased one-year mortality include smoking
      (adjusted OR 2.17 (1.02–4.45), p = 0.044), anaemia (adjusted OR 1.32 (1.16–1.47),
      p < 0.001, for every 1 g/dL drop in haemoglobin level), lower BMI (adjusted OR
      0.93 (0.87–0.98), p = 0.005, for every 1 point increase in BMI), Malay and Indian
      ethnicity (adjusted OR 2.68 (1.53–4.65), p = 0.001), peripheral vascular disease 
      (adjusted OR 4.21 (1.62–10.38), p = 0.004), advanced age (adjusted OR 1.04
      (1.01–1.06), p = 0.004, for every one year increase in age), emergency surgery
      (adjusted OR 2.26 (1.29–3.15), p = 0.005) and malignancy (adjusted OR 3.20
      (1.85–5.52), p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study shows that modifiable risk
      factors such as malnutrition, anaemia and smoking which affect short term
      mortality extend beyond the immediate perioperative period into longer term
      outcomes. Identification and optimization of this subset of patients are
      therefore vital. Further similar large studies should be done to develop a risk
      scoring system for post-operative long-term outcomes. This would aid clinicians
      in risk stratification, counselling and surgical planning, which will help in
      patients’ decision making and care planning.

TI  - The nephrologist's guide to cannabis and cannabinoids.
PG  - 248-57
AB  - Purpose of review: Cannabis (marijuana, weed, pot, ganja, Mary Jane) is the most 
      commonly used federally illicit drug in the United States. The present review
      provides an overview of cannabis and cannabinoids with relevance to the practice 
      of nephrology so that clinicians can best take care of patients. Recent findings:
      Cannabis may have medicinal benefits for treating symptoms of advanced chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease including as a pain adjuvant
      potentially reducing the need for opioids. Cannabis does not seem to affect
      kidney function in healthy individuals. However, renal function should be closely
      monitored in those with CKD, the lowest effective dose should be used, and
      smoking should be avoided. Cannabis use may delay transplant candidate listing or
      contribute to ineligibility. Cannabidiol (CBD) has recently exploded in
      popularity. Although generally well tolerated, safe without significant side
      effects, and effective for a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, 
      consumers have easy access to a wide range of unregulated CBD products, some with
      inaccurate labeling and false health claims. Importantly, CBD may raise
      tacrolimus levels. Summary: Patients and healthcare professionals have little
      guidance or evidence regarding the impact of cannabis use on people with kidney
      disease. This knowledge gap will remain as long as federal regulations remain
      prohibitively restrictive towards prospective research.

TI  - Antinociceptive effects of green synthesized copper nanoparticles alone or in
      combination with morphine.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antinociceptive effect of
      biosynthetic copper nanoparticles from aqueous extract of Capparis spinosa fruit.
      Methods: In this study, green synthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) was
      performed using C. spinosa extract according to the method described previously. 
      The synthesized CuNPs were characterized using the UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier
      transforms of infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
      energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The antinociceptive effect of CuNPs was evaluated 
      by tail-flick, hot-plate, and rotarod tests following the oral administration of 
      mice with CuNPs at the concentrations of 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg for two weeks.
      Results: The obtained maximum peak at the wavelength of 414 nm demonstrated the
      biosynthesis of the copper nanoparticles. SEM approved the particle size of CuNPs
      between 17 and 41 nm. The statistical analyses of the data of hot plate and
      tail-flick tests showed the potent analgesic effect of biosynthetic CuNPs. In
      this regard, the antinociceptive effect of at the doses of 75 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg 
      plus morphine was significantly higher in comparison with the control group
      receiving morphine alone (P < 0.05). No significant (p > 0.05) difference was
      observed after the administration of CuNPs at the doses of 25, 50, and 75 mg/kg
      in the sensory-motor test. Conclusion: The present investigation demonstrated the
      analgesic effects of CuNPs especially in combination with morphine. These
      findings can provide a new strategy for producing new antinociceptive medications
      in the future.

      with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Survival Duration.
LID - 33
AB  - Associations of modulators of quality of life (QoL) and survival duration are
      assessed in the fatal motor neuron disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Major 
      categories include clinical impression of mood (CIM); physical health; patient
      social support; and usage of interventions, pharmaceuticals, and supplements.
      Associations were assessed at p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 significance thresholds
      using applicable methods (Chi-square, t-test, ANOVA, logistical regression,
      random forests, Fisher’s exact test) within a retrospective cohort of 1585
      patients. Factors significantly correlated with positive (happy or normal) mood
      included family support and usage of bi-level positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP)
      and/or cough assist. Decline in physical factors like presence of dysphagia,
      drooling, general pain, and decrease in ALSFRS-R total score or forced vital
      capacity (FVC) significantly correlated with negative (depressed or anxious) mood
      (p < 0.05). Use of antidepressants or pain medications had no association with
      ALS patient mood (p > 0.05), but were significantly associated with increased
      survival (p < 0.05). Positive patient mood, Bi-PAP, cough assist, percutaneous
      endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and accompaniment to clinic visits associated with 
      increased survival duration (p < 0.001). Of the 47 most prevalent pharmaceutical 
      and supplement categories, 17 associated with significant survival duration
      increases ranging +4.5 to +16.5 months. Tricyclic antidepressants, non-opioids,
      muscle relaxants, and vitamin E had the highest associative increases in survival
      duration (p < 0.05). Random forests, which examined complex interactions,
      identified the following pharmaceuticals and supplements as most predictive to
      survival duration: Vitamin A, multivitamin, PEG supplements, alternative herbs,
      antihistamines, muscle relaxants, stimulant laxatives, and antispastics. Statins,
      metformin, and thiazide diuretics had insignificant associations with decreased
      survival.

TI  - Low Testosterone in Adolescents & Young Adults.
LID - 916
AB  - Male hypogonadism, the clinical syndrome with variable symptoms associated with
      gonadal dysfunction, can affect men of all ages. In older males, physiologic
      changes of the aging testis, account for the majority of decreased testosterone
      levels in this population. For younger males and adolescents, the etiology of
      hypogonadism is commonly due to congenital or acquired conditions that disrupt
      the testis production of testosterone or signaling from the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Diagnosis of hypogonadism in younger males
      can be a challenge, as symptoms such as decreased libido or erectile dysfunction,
      common in the older men, are not usually present, and young men instead commonly 
      complain of low energy. While an underlying congenital cause should always be
      considered in young men with hypogonadism, acquired conditions such as obesity,
      diabetes, anabolic steroid or illicit drug use have all been associated with low 
      testosterone levels. Outside of modifying identifiable risk factors for
      hypogonadism, pharmacologic testosterone therapy can also lead to therapeutic
      dilemmas in young men who desire paternity. Topical or injectable administration 
      of testosterone, through negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, can
      decrease spermatogenesis, posing an infertility risk. Other agents that can
      replace testosterone or increase the body's natural production of testosterone
      without decreasing spermatogenesis are preferred, such as intranasal
      testosterone, selective estrogen modulators, aromatase inhibitors or
      human-chorionic gonadotrophin, often used in combination. Clinicians must
      maintain a high level of suspicion to properly diagnose young men with
      hypogonadism and tailor treatment based on both the underlying etiology and
      fertility goals.

LID - 317
AB  - Sepsis, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is caused by a deregulated
      host response to pathogens, and subsequent life-threatening organ dysfunctions.
      All major systems, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic,
      hematological, and the neurological system may be affected by sepsis. Sepsis
      associated neurological dysfunction is triggered by multiple factors including
      neuro-inflammation, excitotoxicity, and ischemia. Ischemia results from reduced
      cerebral blood flow, caused by extreme variations of blood pressure, occlusion of
      cerebral vessels, or more subtle defects of the microcirculation. International
      guidelines comprehensively describe the initial hemodynamic management of sepsis,
      revolving around the normalization of systemic hemodynamics and of arterial
      lactate. By contrast, the management of sepsis patients suffering from brain
      dysfunction is poorly detailed, the only salient point being mentioned is that
      sedation and analgesia should be optimized. However, sepsis and the hemodynamic
      consequences thereof as well as vasopressors may have severe untoward
      neurological consequences. The current review describes the general neurological 
      complications, as well as the consequences of vasopressor therapy on the brain
      and its circulation and addresses methods for cerebral monitoring during sepsis.

      Exosomal Dynamics in the Nucleus Accumbens.
LID - 581
AB  - Alteration of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc)
      has been implicated in cocaine-seeking behaviors. Astroglial mechanisms for
      maintaining extracellular glutamate homeostasis through cysteine/glutamate
      exchanger (xCT) and glutamate transporter GLT1 are dysregulated following cocaine
      exposure and contribute to altered glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. However,
      how these astroglial proteins become dysregulated in cocaine addiction remains
      unknown. We recently showed that neuron to astroglial exosome signaling is
      essential to maintain GLT1 protein expression by transferring neuronal miR-124-3p
      into astrocytes to suppress GLT1-inhibiting microRNAs (miRs) in astrocytes. In
      the current study, by selectively labeling neuronal exosomes using CD63-GFPf/+
      exosome reporter mice, we examined how the self-administration and extinction
      stages of the mouse cocaine self-administration model alter neuronal exosome
      signaling to astrocytes and microglia in the NAc. We found that cocaine (but not 
      food) self-administration strongly reduces the internalization of neuronal
      exosomes, particularly in astrocytes in the NAc (but not in motor cortex), which 
      can be effectively reversed by extinction training. In parallel, cocaine
      self-administration alone specifically and differentially affects activation of
      glial cells by decreasing GFAP expression in astrocytes but increasing Iba1
      expression in microglia. However, extinction training fully reverses the
      increased Iba1 expression in microglia but only partially reverses the reduction 
      of GFAP in astrocytes. Taken together, our study reveals altered in vivo dynamics
      of NAc neuronal exosomes in the cocaine addiction model, providing new insights
      about how altered neuron to glial exosome signaling may contribute to astroglial 
      dysfunction in cocaine addiction.

TI  - Behavioral and Neuroanatomical Account of Impulsivity in Parkinson's Disease.
LID - 1338
AB  - Impulse control disorder (ICD) is a major non-motor complication of Parkinson's
      disease (PD) with often devastating consequences for patients' quality of life.
      In this study, we aimed to characterize the phenotype of impulsivity in PD and
      its neuroanatomical correlates.Methods: Thirty-seven PD patients (15 patients
      with ICD, 22 patients without ICD) and 36 healthy controls underwent a
      neuropsychological battery. The test battery consisted of anxiety and depression 
      scales, self-report measures of impulsivity (Barratt scale and UPPS-P),
      behavioral measures of impulsive action (Go/No-Go task, Stop signal task) and
      impulsive choice (Delay discounting, Iowa gambling task), and measures of
      cognitive abilities (working memory, attention, executive function). Patients and
      controls underwent structural MRI scanning.Results: Patients with ICD had
      significantly higher levels of self-reported impulsivity (Barratt scale and Lack 
      of perseverance from UPPS-P) in comparison with healthy controls and
      non-impulsive PD patients, but they performed similarly in behavioral tasks,
      except for the Iowa gambling task. In this task, patients with ICD made
      significantly less risky decisions than patients without ICD and healthy
      controls. Patients without ICD did not differ from healthy controls in
      self-reported impulsivity or behavioral measurements. Both patient groups were
      more anxious and depressive than healthy controls. MRI scanning revealed
      structural differences in cortical areas related to impulse control in both
      patient groups. Patients without ICD had lower volumes and cortical thickness of 
      bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Patients with ICD had higher volumes of right
      caudal anterior cingulate and rostral middle frontal cortex.Conclusions: Despite 
      the presence of ICD as confirmed by both clinical follow-up and self-reported
      impulsivity scales and supported by structural differences in various neural
      nodes related to inhibitory control and reward processing, patients with ICD
      performed no worse than healthy controls in various behavioral tasks previously
      hypothesized as robust impulsivity measures. These results call for caution
      against impetuous interpretation of behavioral tests, since various factors may
      and will influence the ultimate outcomes, be it the lack of sensitivity in
      specific, limited ICD subtypes, excessive caution of ICD patients during testing 
      due to previous negative experience rendering simplistic tasks insufficient, or
      other, as of now unknown aspects, calling for further research.

TI  - The Pain Paradox of Borderline Personality and Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA):
      Recruiting Borderline Personality Organization to Predict the One-Year
      Postoperative Outcome.
PG  - 49-55
AB  - Background: TKA is a common treatment for arthropathies of the knee; however, its
      results are compromised by psychosocial equivalents of pain: prior research
      suggests persistent pain and dysfunction after TKA not only to be linked to
      psychological symptoms such as depression or anxiety but also to psychodynamic
      determinants of borderline personality, namely borderline personality
      organization. Osteoarthritis (OA) and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the main
      indications for TKA, are themselves linked to personality factors and disorders, 
      e.g. borderline. The present study investigates the influence of borderline
      personality organization (BPO) on the outcomes of TKA one year postoperatively.
      Methods: We studied 144 patients scheduled for primary TKA before and after the
      operation using the IPO-16 and the WOMAC for the assessment of knee pain and
      function. Results: Non-parametric correlations were found between primitive
      defenses and knee-pain, not function. Linear regression showed prediction of knee
      pain and knee function by the preoperative WOMAC scores (p<0.01), whereas there
      was additional prediction of knee-pain by gender (p=0.03) and primitive defenses 
      (p=0.04). Discussion: The results suggest a psychodynamic mechanism of
      maladaptation after TKA apparently representing the bodily manifestations of
      fundamental psychic defenses.

TI  - Stimulant safe supply: a potential opportunity to respond to the overdose
      epidemic.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: Occurring against the backdrop of an overdose crisis, stimulant use
      and stimulant-involved deaths in North America are increasing at an alarming
      rate. Many of these deaths are being attributed to fentanyl and related analogs, 
      which have been increasingly found within street-level stimulant supplies. Within
      this, people experiencing socio-economic marginalization are at the greatest risk
      of overdose and other harms from adulterated stimulants. Current treatments for
      stimulant use disorder have limited effectiveness, and even less applicability to
      the lived realities of marginalized stimulant users. Emerging technologies, such 
      as drug checking, are being implemented to support safer stimulant use, but the
      accessibility and utility of these technologies to stimulant users are framed by 
      experiences of vulnerability that render them largely ineffective. Stimulant safe
      supply: Solutions that provide a legal and safe supply of non-adulterated
      stimulants of known quality, and within a health care framework, are needed to
      directly address the risk of an increasingly adulterated stimulant supply.
      Similar innovative opioid-focused interventions are being piloted with
      medications that have a similar pharmacological effect as their illicit
      counterparts. While there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for
      stimulant use, research has demonstrated a number of stimulant medications that
      are promising substitutes for cocaine and methamphetamine use. Much like with
      opioid-focused pharmacotherapies, having a consistent and safe supply of
      stimulants can lead to improved health outcomes and will drastically reduce
      overdose risk. However, for a stimulant safe supply intervention to be a success,
      it must provide the high and performance-enhancing effects that people seek from 
      the illicit market, which requires doses and user agency that trials to date have
      not provided. Conclusion: Efforts are needed to investigate the feasibility of
      pharmacological stimulant-based interventions that address safe supply needs. The
      promise of similar opioid-focused approaches in addressing both overdose-related 
      risks and experiences related to vulnerability underscores the need to advance
      safe supply approaches targeted towards people who use stimulants. Given the
      current overdose crisis and rising stimulant use across North America, the
      implementation and evaluation of such novel stimulant-focused interventions
      should be a public health priority.

TI  - Improving the organization and interactivity of metabolic pathfinding with
      precomputed pathways.
LID - 13
AB  - Background: The rapid growth of available knowledge on metabolic processes across
      thousands of species continues to expand the possibilities of producing chemicals
      by combining pathways found in different species. Several computational search
      algorithms have been developed for automating the identification of possible
      heterologous pathways; however, these searches may return thousands of pathway
      results. Although the large number of results are in part due to the large number
      of possible compounds and reactions, a subset of core reaction modules is
      repeatedly observed in pathway results across multiple searches, suggesting that 
      some subpaths between common compounds were more consistently explored than
      others.To reduce the resources spent on searching the same metabolic space, a new
      meta-algorithm for metabolic pathfinding, Hub Pathway search with Atom Tracking
      (HPAT), was developed to take advantage of a precomputed network of subpath
      modules. To investigate the efficacy of this method, we created a table
      describing a network of common hub metabolites and how they are biochemically
      connected and only offloaded searches to and from this hub network onto an
      interactive webserver capable of visualizing the resulting pathways. Results: A
      test set of nineteen known pathways taken from literature and metabolic databases
      were used to evaluate if HPAT was capable of identifying known pathways. HPAT
      found the exact pathway for eleven of the nineteen test cases using a diverse set
      of precomputed subpaths, whereas a comparable pathfinding search algorithm that
      does not use precomputed subpaths found only seven of the nineteen test cases.
      The capability of HPAT to find novel pathways was demonstrated by its ability to 
      identify novel 3-hydroxypropanoate (3-HP) synthesis pathways. As for pathway
      visualization, the new interactive pathway filters enable a reduction of the
      number of displayed pathways from hundreds down to less than ten pathways in
      several test cases, illustrating their utility in reducing the amount of
      presented information while retaining pathways of interest. Conclusions: This
      work presents the first step in incorporating a precomputed subpath network into 
      metabolic pathfinding and demonstrates how this leads to a concise, interactive
      visualization of pathway results. The modular nature of metabolic pathways is
      exploited to facilitate efficient discovery of alternate pathways.

TI  - Health care professionals’ knowledge of commonly used sedative, analgesic and
      neuromuscular drugs: A single center (Rambam Health Care Campus), prospective,
      observational survey.
LID - e0227499
AB  - Background: Pain management and sedation are important aspects in the treatment
      of hospitalized patients, especially those mechanically ventilated. In many
      hospitals, such patients are treated not only in intensive care units, but also
      in other wards. In the nineteen eighties, numerous studies demonstrated a wide
      array of misconceptions and inadequate knowledge related to commonly used
      sedative, analgesics and muscle relaxants which may prevent appropriate
      treatment. Since these publications, multiple studies have shown that appropriate
      sedation and analgesia are associated with improved clinical outcomes,
      educational programs were developed and guidelines published. Whether the
      personnel’s knowledge kept up with these changes is unknown. The aim of this
      study was to determine the current rate of misconceptions and knowledge gaps
      regarding commonly used sedative, analgesic and neuromuscular drugs. Methods: In 
      this prospective, observational, cross-sectional survey, a questionnaire was
      e-mailed to physicians and nurses routinely treating mechanically ventilated
      patients in Rambam Health Care Campus (Haifa, Israel). Results: 355
      questionnaires were returned. 82.54% knew that midazolam has no analgesic effect.
      71–72% were familiar with the sedative effect of opiates. 27% believed that
      propofol has analgesic properties and 30.52% thought that rocuronium has a
      sedative effect. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that although a lot has
      been done during the last decades in order to improve the treatment of critically
      ill patients, the rate of misconceptions regarding pharmacological
      characteristics of commonly used drugs is unacceptably high. We call for
      performance of similar surveys in other institutes and for immediate action to
      improve patients’ care.

TI  - Association between opioid analgesic therapy and initiation of buprenorphine
      management: An analysis of prescription drug monitoring program data.
LID - e0227350
AB  - Background: In the US, medication assisted treatment, particularly with
      office-based buprenorphine, has been an important component of opioid dependence 
      treatment among patients with iatrogenic addiction to opioid analgesics. The
      predictors of initiating buprenorphine for addiction among opioid analgesic
      patients have not been well-described. Methods: We conducted a time-to-event
      analysis using data from the North Carolina (NC) Prescription Drug Monitoring
      Program (PDMP). Our outcome of interest was time-to-initiation of sublingual
      buprenorphine. Our study population was a prospective cohort of all state
      residents receiving a full-agonist opioid analgesic between 2011 and 2015.
      Predictors of initiation of sublingual buprenorphine examined included: age,
      gender, cumulative pharmacies and prescribers utilized, cumulative opioid
      intensity (defined as cumulative opioid exposure divided by duration of opioid
      exposure), and benzodiazepine dispensing. Findings: Of 4.3 million patients
      receiving opioid analgesics in NC between 2011 and 2015 (accumulated 8.30 million
      person-years of follow-up), and a total of 28,904 patients initiated
      buprenorphine formulations intended for addiction treatment (overall rate 3.48
      per 1,000 person-years). In adjusted multivariate models, the utilization of 3 or
      more pharmacies (HR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.82, 3.05) or 6 or more controlled substance 
      prescribers (HR: 12.09; 95% CI: 10.76, 13.57) was associated with buprenorphine
      initiation. A dose-response relationship was observed for cumulative opioid
      intensity (HR in highest decile relative to lowest decile: 5.05; 95% CI: 4.70,
      5.42). Benzodiazepine dispensing was negatively associated with buprenorphine
      initiation (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.65). Conclusions: Opioid analgesic patients
      utilizing multiple prescribers or pharmacies are more likely to initiate
      sublingual buprenorphine. This finding suggests that patients with multiple
      healthcare interactions are more likely to be treated for high-risk opioid use,
      or may be more likely to be identified and treated for addiction. Future research
      should utilize prescription monitoring program data linked to electronic health
      records to include diagnosis information in analytic models.

TI  - Adrenomedullin: an important participant in neurological diseases.
PG  - 1199-207
AB  - Adrenomedullin, a peptide with multiple physiological functions in nervous system
      injury and disease, has aroused the interest of researchers. This review
      summarizes the role of adrenomedullin in neuropathological disorders, including
      pathological pain, brain injury and nerve regeneration, and their treatment. As a
      newly characterized pronociceptive mediator, adrenomedullin has been shown to act
      as an upstream factor in the transmission of noxious information for various
      types of pathological pain including acute and chronic inflammatory pain, cancer 
      pain, neuropathic pain induced by spinal nerve injury and diabetic neuropathy.
      Initiation of glia-neuron signaling networks in the peripheral and central
      nervous system by adrenomedullin is involved in the formation and maintenance of 
      morphine tolerance. Adrenomedullin has been shown to exert a facilitated or
      neuroprotective effect against brain injury including hemorrhagic or ischemic
      stroke and traumatic brain injury. Additionally, adrenomedullin can serve as a
      regulator to promote nerve regeneration in pathological conditions. Therefore,
      adrenomedullin is an important participant in nervous system diseases.

TI  - ABC efflux transporters at blood-central nervous system barriers and their
      implications for treating spinal cord disorders.
PG  - 1235-42
AB  - The barriers present in the interfaces between the blood and the central nervous 
      system form a major hurdle for the pharmacological treatment of central nervous
      system injuries and diseases. The family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporters has been widely studied regarding efflux of medications at
      blood-central nervous system barriers. These efflux transporters include
      P-glycoprotein (abcb1), ‘breast cancer resistance protein’ (abcg2) and the
      various ‘multidrug resistance-associated proteins’ (abccs). Understanding which
      efflux transporters are present at the blood-spinal cord, blood-cerebrospinal
      fluid and cerebrospinal fluid-spinal cord barriers is necessary to determine
      their involvement in limiting drug transfer from blood to the spinal cord tissue.
      Recent developments in the blood-brain barrier field have shown that barrier
      systems are dynamic and the profile of barrier defenses can alter due to
      conditions such as age, disease and environmental challenge. This means that a
      true understanding of ABC efflux transporter expression and localization should
      not be one static value but instead a range that represents the complex patient
      subpopulations that exist. In the present review, the blood-central nervous
      system barrier literature is discussed with a focus on the impact of ABC efflux
      transporters on: (i) protecting the spinal cord from adverse effects of
      systemically directed drugs, and (ii) limiting centrally directed drugs from
      accessing their active sites within the spinal cord.

TI  - Challenges and Opportunities in Preclinical Research of Synthetic Cannabinoids
      for Pain Therapy.
LID - 24
AB  - Cannabis has been used in pain management since 2900 BC. In the 20th century,
      synthetic cannabinoids began to emerge, thus opening the way for improved
      efficacy. The search for new forms of synthetic cannabinoids continues and, as
      such, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive tool for the research 
      and development of this promising class of drugs. Methods for the in vitro
      assessment of cytotoxic, mutagenic or developmental effects are presented,
      followed by the main in vivo pain models used in cannabis research and the
      results yielded by different types of administration (systemic versus intrathecal
      versus inhalation). Animal models designed for assessing side-effects and
      long-term uses are also discussed. In the second part of this review,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of synthetic cannabinoid
      biodistribution, together with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometric
      identification of synthetic cannabinoids in biological fluids from rodents to
      humans are presented. Last, but not least, different strategies for improving the
      solubility and physicochemical stability of synthetic cannabinoids and their
      potential impact on pain management are discussed. In conclusion, synthetic
      cannabinoids are one of the most promising classes of drugs in pain medicine, and
      preclinical research should focus on identifying new and improved alternatives
      for a better clinical and preclinical outcome.

TI  - Current Pharmacological Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: A Narrative
      Review.
LID - 25
AB  - Background and Objectives: Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) is one of the
      most common chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. Although it is usually
      characterized by progressive sensory loss, some patients may develop chronic
      pain. Assessment of DSPN is not difficult, but the biggest challenge is making
      the correct diagnosis and choosing the right treatment. The treatment of DSPN has
      three primary objectives: glycemic control, pathogenic mechanisms, and pain
      management. The aim of this brief narrative review is to summarize the current
      pharmacological treatment of painful DSPN. It also summarizes knowledge on
      pathogenesis-oriented therapy, which is generally overlooked in many publications
      and guidelines. Materials and Methods: The present review reports the relevant
      information available on DSPN treatment. The search was performed on PubMed,
      Cochrane, Semantic Scholar, Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases,
      including among others the terms “distal symmetrical polyneuropathy”,
      “neuropathic pain treatment”, “diabetic neuropathy”, “diabetes complications”,
      ”glycaemic control”, “antidepressants”, “opioids”, and “anticonvulsants”.
      Results: First-line drugs include antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) and pregabalin. Second- and third-line 
      drugs include opioids and topical analgesics. While potentially effective in the 
      treatment of neuropathic pain, opioids are not considered to be the first choice 
      because of adverse reactions and addiction concerns. Conclusions: DSPN is a
      common complication in patients with diabetes, and severely affects the quality
      of life of these patients. Although multiple therapies are available, the
      guidelines and recommendations regarding the treatment of diabetic neuropathy
      have failed to offer a unitary consensus, which often hinders the therapeutic
      options in clinical practice.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Opioid Cessation.
LID - 180
AB  - The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) and
      overdose-related deaths. However, the genetic basis for the ability to
      discontinue opioid use has not been investigated. We performed a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) of opioid cessation (defined as abstinence from illicit 
      opioids for >1 year or <6 months before the interview date) in 1130 African
      American (AA) and 2919 European ancestry (EA) participants recruited for genetic 
      studies of substance use disorders and who met lifetime Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for OUD.
      Association tests performed separately within each ethnic group were combined by 
      meta-analysis with results obtained from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study.
      Although there were no genome-wide significant associations, we found suggestive 
      associations with nine independent loci, including three which are biologically
      relevant: rs4740988 in PTPRD (pAA + EA = 2.24 × 10−6), rs36098404 in MYOM2 (pEA =
      2.24 × 10−6), and rs592026 in SNAP25-AS1 (pEA = 6.53 × 10−6). Significant
      pathways identified in persons of European ancestry (EA) are related to vitamin D
      metabolism (p = 3.79 × 10−2) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (p =
      2.39 × 10−2). UK Biobank traits including smoking and drinking cessation and
      chronic back pain were significantly associated with opioid cessation using
      GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores. These results provide evidence for genetic
      influences on opioid cessation, suggest genetic overlap with other relevant
      traits, and may indicate potential novel therapeutic targets for OUD.

TI  - Physical Activity in Eating Disorders: A Systematic Review.
LID - 183
AB  - Abnormally high levels of physical activity have been documented throughout the
      literature in patients with eating disorders (ED), especially those diagnosed
      with anorexia nervosa (AN). Yet no clear definition, conceptualization, or
      treatment of the problematic use of physical activity (PPA) in ED patients
      exists. The aim of this review is to propose a new classification of PPA, report 
      the prevalence, triggers, predictors, maintainers and other related factors of
      PPA in ED patients, in addition to proposing a comprehensive model of the
      development of PPA in AN. A total of 47 articles, retrieved from Medline and Web 
      of Science, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. As a
      result, the new approach of PPA was divided into two groups (group 1 and group 2)
      according to the dimension (quantitative vs qualitative approach) of physical
      activity that was evaluated. The prevalence of PPA in ED was reported in 20 out
      of 47 studies, the comparison of PPA between ED versus controls in 21 articles,
      and the links between PPA and psychological factors in ED in 26 articles,
      including depression (16/26), anxiety (13/26), obsessive–compulsiveness (9/26),
      self-esteem (4/26), addictiveness (1/26), regulation and verbal expression of
      emotions (1/26) and anhedonia (1/26). The links between PPA and ED
      symptomatology, PPA and weight, body mass index (BMI) and body composition in ED,
      PPA and age, onset, illness duration and lifetime activity status in ED, PPA and 
      ED treatment outcome were reported in 18, 15, 7, 5 articles, respectively. All of
      the factors have been systematically clustered into group 1 and group 2. Results 
      focused more on AN rather than BN due to the limited studies on the latter.
      Additionally, a model for the development of PPA in AN patients was proposed,
      encompassing five periods evolving into three clinical stages. Thus, two very
      opposite components of PPA in AN were suggested: voluntarily PPA increased in AN 
      was viewed as a conscious strategy to maximize weight loss, while involuntarily
      PPA increased proportionally with weight-loss, indicating that exercise might be 
      under the control of a subconscious biological drive and involuntary cognition.

TI  - Inhibitory Effects of Columbianadin on Nociceptive Behaviors in a Neuropathic
      Pain Model, and on Voltage-Gated Calcium Currents in Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons
      in Mice.
LID - 1522
AB  - Radix angelicae pubescentis (RAP) has been used in Chinese traditional medicine
      to treat painful diseases such as rheumatism and headache. A previous study has
      reported that columbianadin (CBN), a major coumarin in RAP inhibits acute and
      inflammatory pain behaviors. However, the effects of CBN on neuropathic pain
      behaviors, and the potential underlying mechanism have not been reported. In the 
      present study, the effects of CBN, compared to another major coumarin of RAP
      osthole (OST), on oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain behaviors and on the
      voltage-gated calcium currents in small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were
      studied in mice. It was found that CBN and OST inhibited both mechanical and cold
      hypersensitivity induced by oxaliplatin. Moreover, CBN and OST might
      preferentially inhibit T- and L-type calcium currents (Ica). The inhibitory
      effects of CBN and OST on the oxaliplatin-induced mechanical allodynia were
      prevented by gabapentin. These results suggest that CBN, as well as OST might
      inhibit neuropathic pain behaviors through an inhibition of T- and L-type calcium
      currents in nociceptive DRG neurons.

TI  - A Well-Trained Team During Anaphylactic Shock After Rocuronium in a Patient With 
      Aortic Stenosis: A Case Report.
LID - 305
AB  - A 66-year-old patient with aortic stenosis was scheduled for an aortic valve
      replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery. Anesthesia was induced by
      intravenous injection of midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol. After administration 
      of rocuronium, he developed anaphylactic shock, which was diagnosed by clinical
      signs, vital parameters, and unresponsiveness to the usual vasopressors. After 30
      min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient survived without any
      neurological deficits. This case is a reminder that early recognition and
      treatment of intraoperative hypersensitivity reactions are imperative.
      Anesthetists should also receive simulation training to achieve an adequate
      experience in a safe environment. With a well-trained team, it is possible to
      save the life of patients with aortic stenosis.

TI  - Escalated Oxycodone Self-Administration and Punishment: Differential Expression
      of Opioid Receptors and Immediate Early Genes in the Rat Dorsal Striatum and
      Prefrontal Cortex.
LID - 1392
AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is characterized by compulsive drug taking despite
      adverse life consequences. Here, we sought to identify neurobiological
      consequences associated with the behavioral effects of contingent footshocks
      administered after escalation of oxycodone self-administration. To reach these
      goals, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer oxycodone for 4 weeks 
      and were then exposed to contingent electric footshocks. This paradigm helped to 
      dichotomize rats into two distinct behavioral phenotypes: (1) those that reduce
      lever pressing (shock-sensitive) and (2) others that continue lever pressing
      (shock-resistant) for oxycodone during contingent punishment. The rats were
      euthanized at 2-h after the last oxycodone plus footshock session. The dorsal
      striata and prefrontal cortices were dissected for use in western blot and
      RT-qPCR analyses. All oxycodone self-administration rats showed significant
      decreased expression of Mu and Kappa opioid receptor proteins only in the dorsal 
      striatum. However, expression of Delta opioid receptor protein was decreased in
      both brain regions. RT-qPCR analyses documented significant decreases in the
      expression of c-fos, fosB, fra2, junB, egr1, and egr2 mRNAs in the dorsal
      striatum (but not in PFC) of the shock-sensitive rats. In the PFC, junD
      expression was reduced in both phenotypes. However, egr3 mRNA expression was
      increased in the PFC of only shock-resistant rats. These results reveal that,
      similar to psychostimulants and alcohol, footshocks can dichotomize rats that
      escalated their intake of oxycodone into two distinct behavioral phenotypes.
      These animals also show significant differences in the mRNA expression of
      immediate early genes, mainly, in the dorsal striatum. The increases in PFC egr3 
      expression in the shock-resistant rats suggest that Egr3 might be involved in the
      persistence of oxycodone-associated memory under aversive conditions. This
      punishment-driven model may help to identify neurobiological substrates of
      persistent oxycodone taking and abstinence in the presence of adverse
      consequences.

TI  - Women’s Perspectives On Provider Education Regarding Opioid Use.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - Objective: To elucidate women’s experiences with opioid medications and their
      perspectives on provider education regarding opioid use, risks and safety.
      Methods: Women with a self-reported history of pain who had been prescribed
      opioids were recruited in 2016 using a convenience sampling approach that
      included an online social media campaign. Participants (N=154) completed online
      surveys and open-ended questions regarding their experiences with pain and
      opioids, and their perspectives on the quality of education they received from
      their providers. Results: Participants reported receiving insufficient education 
      about opioid-related side effects, as reflected in both ratings for the quantity 
      and quality of education they received from their providers. Non-white
      participants reported lower quantity and poorer quality of provider education
      (p<0.05). Themes identified from the qualitative data included frustrations with 
      pain management options, fear of opioids, stigma associated with opioid use, and 
      the need for improved provider education and patient-provider communication.
      Conclusion: Findings suggest that from a patient’s perspective, there is a need
      for enhanced patient-provider communication and education regarding pain
      management and potential opioid-related side effects. Improved physician
      communication and education could promote shared decision-making and result in
      enhanced satisfaction with care and health outcomes.

TI  - Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip: Risk and Therapy.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of occupation in
      patients with transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH). The study also compares
      two different types of management for this condition: conservative treatment and 
      surgical drilling. Methods: This was a retrospective case series study. The
      medical records for patients diagnosed with TOH at our institution within the
      period 2012–2017 were retrieved. General demographic data, clinical features, and
      diagnostic modalities were obtained. In addition, management procedures and their
      associated prognostic factors were acquired. The effectiveness of these
      procedures was assessed by the number of days of sick leave, the time needed for 
      full recovery and the number of recurrences of TOH. Also, pain responses at 24
      hrs, 48 hrs, and at 1 week were estimated subjectively through a “pain score” out
      of 10, and objectively through the degree of improvement in daily activity. The
      patients had a regular follow-up at 4- to 6-week intervals. Results: In total, 15
      cases of TOH, 14 men and one woman, were enrolled in the study. The mean age of
      the patients was 41 years (range 26–59 years). Out of the 15 cases, nine were
      healthcare professionals (eight physicians and one nurse). Ten patients underwent
      hip drilling for core decompression and five patients were treated
      conservatively. The time needed for full recovery was 5.8 weeks for those who
      underwent drilling, and 48.3 weeks for three patients receiving conservative
      treatment. The other two patients who were treated conservatively had not
      achieved full or near-full recovery at the time of reporting this study.
      Conclusion: Physicians may be at increased risk of developing TOH. Further
      studies should be conducted to examine the role of this occupation as a risk
      factor. In addition, hip drilling should be considered as an effective treatment 
      modality, especially in those patients who seek a faster recovery.

TI  - Bowel movement frequency and risks of major vascular and non-vascular diseases: a
      population-based cohort study among Chinese adults.
LID - e031028
AB  - Objective: The application of bowel movement frequency (BMF) in primary care is
      limited by the lack of solid evidence about the associations of BMF with health
      outcomes apart from Parkinson’s disease and colorectal cancer. We examined the
      prospective associations of BMF with major vascular and non-vascular diseases
      outside the digestive system. Design: Population-based prospective cohort study. 
      Setting: The China Kadoorie Biobank in which participants from 10 geographically 
      diverse areas across China were enrolled between 2004 and 2008. Participants: 487
      198 participants aged 30 to 79 years without cancer, heart disease or stroke at
      baseline were included and followed up for a median of 10 years. The usual BMF
      was self-reported once at baseline. Primary and secondary outcome measures:
      Incident events of predefined major vascular and non-vascular diseases. Results: 
      In multivariable-adjusted analyses, participants having bowel movements ‘more
      than once a day’ had higher risks of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), heart
      failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared with the reference group (‘once a
      day’). The respective HRs (95% CIs) were 1.12 (1.09 to 1.16), 1.33 (1.22 to
      1.46), 1.28 (1.22 to 1.36), 1.20 (1.15 to 1.26) and 1.15 (1.07 to 1.24). The
      lowest BMF (‘less than three times a week’) was also associated with higher risks
      of IHD, major coronary events, ischaemic stroke and CKD. The respective HRs were 
      1.07 (1.02 to 1.12), 1.22 (1.10 to 1.36), 1.11 (1.05 to 1.16) and 1.20 (1.07 to
      1.35). Conclusion: BMF was associated with future risks of multiple vascular and 
      non-vascular diseases. The integration of BMF assessment and health counselling
      into primary care should be considered.

      knee arthroplasty in osteoarthritis patients (PIPFORCE): a multicentre,
      double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
LID - e030501
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the morphine-sparing effects of the sequential treatment 
      versus placebo in subjects undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the effects 
      on pain relief, inflammation control and functional rehabilitation after TKA and 
      safety. Design: Double-blind, pragmatic, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
      Setting: Four tertiary hospitals in China. Participants: 246 consecutive patients
      who underwent elective unilateral TKA because of osteoarthritis (OA).
      Interventions: Patients were randomised 1:1 to the parecoxib/celecoxib group or
      the control group. The patients in the parecoxib/celecoxib group were supplied
      sequential treatment with intravenous parecoxib 40 mg (every 12 hours) for the
      first 3 days after surgery, followed by oral celecoxib 200 mg (every 12 hours)
      for up to 6 weeks. The patients in the control group were supplied with the
      corresponding placebo under the same instructions. Primary and secondary outcome 
      measures: The primary endpoint was the cumulative opioid consumption at 2 weeks
      post operation (intention-to-treat analysis). Secondary endpoints included the
      Knee Society Score, patient-reported outcomes and the cumulative opioid
      consumption. Results: The cumulative opioid consumption at 2 weeks was
      significantly smaller in the parecoxib/celecoxib group than in the control group 
      (median difference, 57.31 (95% CI 34.66 to 110.33)). The parecoxib/celecoxib
      group achieving superior Knee Society Scores and EQ-5D scores and greater Visual 
      Analogue Scale score reduction during 6 weeks. Interleukin 6, erythrocyte
      sedation rate and C-reactive protein levels were reduced at 72 hours, 2 weeks and
      4 weeks and prostaglandin E2 levels were reduced at 48 hours and 72 hours in the 
      parecoxib/celecoxib group compared with the placebo group. The occurrence of
      adverse events (AEs) was significantly lower in the parecoxib/celecoxib group.
      Conclusions: The sequential intravenous parecoxib followed by oral celecoxib
      regimen reduces morphine consumption, achieves better pain control and functional
      recovery and leads to less AEs than placebo after TKA for OA. Trial registration 
      number: ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT02198924).

TI  - Are the MORECare guidelines on reporting of attrition in palliative care research
      populations appropriate? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised
      controlled trials.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: Palliative care trials have higher rates of attrition. The MORECare
      guidance recommends applying classifications of attrition to report attrition to 
      help interpret trial results. The guidance separates attrition into three
      categories: attrition due to death, illness or at random. The aim of our study is
      to apply the MORECare classifications on reported attrition rates in trials.
      Methods: A systematic review was conducted and attrition classifications
      retrospectively applied. Four databases, EMBASE; Medline, CINHAL and PsychINFO,
      were searched for randomised controlled trials of palliative care populations
      from 01.01.2010 to 08.10.2016. This systematic review is part of a larger review 
      looking at recruitment to randomised controlled trials in palliative care, from
      January 1990 to early October 2016. We ran random-effect models with and without 
      moderators and descriptive statistics to calculate rates of missing data.
      Results: One hundred nineteen trials showed a total attrition of 29% (95% CI 28
      to 30%). We applied the MORECare classifications of attrition to the 91 papers
      that contained sufficient information. The main reason for attrition was
      attrition due to death with a weighted mean of 31.6% (SD 27.4) of attrition
      cases. Attrition due to illness was cited as the reason for 17.6% (SD 24.5) of
      participants. In 50.8% (SD 26.5) of cases, the attrition was at random. We did
      not observe significant differences in missing data between total attrition in
      non-cancer patients (26%; 95% CI 18–34%) and cancer patients (24%; 95% CI
      20–29%). There was significantly more missing data in outpatients (29%; 95% CI
      22–36%) than inpatients (16%; 95% CI 10–23%). We noted increased attrition in
      trials with longer durations. Conclusion: Reporting the cause of attrition is
      useful in helping to understand trial results. Prospective reporting using the
      MORECare classifications should improve our understanding of future trials.

TI  - Preventing opioid overdose with peer-administered naloxone: findings from a rural
      state.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: In response to the opioid epidemic, naloxone distribution programs
      aim to prevent overdose death by making naloxone available and training people to
      use it. Peers of individuals at risk of opioid overdose are well-positioned to
      administer naloxone and prevent overdose death. Methods: We conducted key
      informant interviews with 18 individuals with past or current opioid and heroin
      drug use who had administered naloxone to a peer during an overdose emergency.
      Interviews explored individuals’ experiences with administration and their
      recommendations for program and policy improvement. Data were systematically
      coded and analyzed for themes. Results: Participants sought naloxone rescue kits 
      because they perceived high risk of overdose. They described high satisfaction
      with training and felt prepared to administer naloxone during overdose incidents.
      Overwhelmingly, participants perceived naloxone to be effective and emphasized
      the need to make it widely available. Findings suggest that engagement in
      overdose prevention strategies other than naloxone differs by gender, with
      females more likely than males to use multiple different strategies. Participants
      described that overdose experiences do not have a lasting impact on drug use
      behaviors. Conclusions: Findings support the feasibility of naloxone distribution
      to peer opioid and heroin users and provide recommendations for policy
      improvement, including effective and well-advertised Good Samaritan laws and
      links to treatment for opioid use disorder.

TI  - A prospective, randomized comparison of ultrasonographic visualization of
      proximal intercostal block vs paravertebral block.
LID - 13
AB  - Background: Thoracic paravertebral blockade is an accepted anesthetic and
      analgesic technique for breast surgery. However, real-time ultrasound
      visualization of landmarks in the paravertebral space remains challenging. We
      aimed to compare ultrasound-image quality, performance times, and clinical
      outcomes between the traditional parasagittal ultrasound-guided paravertebral
      block and a modified approach, the ultrasound-guided proximal intercostal block. 
      Methods: Women with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy (n = 20) were randomized 
      to receive either paravertebral (n = 26) or proximal intercostal blocks (n = 32) 
      under ultrasound-guidance with 2.5 mg/kg ropivacaine prior to surgery. Block
      ultrasound images before and after needle placement, and anesthetic injection
      videoclips were saved, and these images and vidoes independently rated by
      separate novice and expert reviewers for quality of visualization of bony
      elements, pleura, relevant ligament/membrane, needle, and injectate spread. Block
      performance times, postoperative pain scores, and opioid consumption were also
      recorded. Results: Composite visualization scores were superior for proximal
      intercostal compared to paravertebral nerve block, as rated by both expert
      (p = 0.008) and novice (p = 0.01) reviewers. Notably, both expert and novice
      rated pleural visualization superior for proximal intercostal nerve block, and
      expert additionally rated bony landmark and injectate spread visualization as
      superior for proximal intercostal block. Block performance times, needle depth,
      opioid consumption and postoperative pain scores were similar between groups.
      Conclusions: Proximal intercostal block yielded superior visualization of key
      anatomical landmarks, possibly offering technical advantages over traditional
      paravertebral nerve block. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02911168.

TI  - Investigating opioid-related fatalities in southern Sweden: contact with
      care-providing authorities and comparison of substances.
LID - 5
AB  - Background: Opioid-related deaths have increased in Western countries over recent
      decades. Despite numerous studies investigating opioid-related mortality, only a 
      few have focused on the lives of the deceased individuals prior to their deaths, 
      specifically regarding contact with care-providing authorities such as health,
      social and correctional services. Furthermore, a change has been noted in the
      last two decades as to which opioids cause most deaths, from heroin to
      prescription opioids. However, studies comparing fatalities caused by different
      substances are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate contact with
      care-providing authorities during the year prior to death among individuals who
      died as a result of opioid intoxication and to analyse differences relating to
      which opioids caused their deaths. Methods: The study is based on retrospective
      register data and includes 180 individuals with a history of illicit drug use,
      who died from opioid intoxication in Skåne, Sweden, between 1 January 2012 to 31 
      December 2013 and 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. Intoxications caused by heroin,
      methadone, buprenorphine and fentanyl were included. Data were collected from the
      National Board of Forensic Medicine, regional health care services, municipal
      social services and the Prison and Probation Service. Statistical testing was
      performed using Pearson’s chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test and the
      Mann-Whitney U test to analyse group differences. Results: A total of 89% of the 
      deceased individuals had been in contact with one or more of the care-providing
      authorities during the year prior to death; 75% had been in contact with health
      care, 69% with the social services, 28% with the Prison and Probation Service,
      and 23% had been enrolled in opioid substitution treatment at some point during
      their final year of life. Few differences appeared between the substance groups
      with regard to which opioid contributed to the death. In addition to opioids,
      sedatives were present in more than 80% of the cases. Individuals whose deaths
      were buprenorphine-related had been in contact with the social services to a
      significantly lesser extent during the year prior to death. Conclusions: The
      studied population is characterised by extensive contact with care-providing
      authorities, thus providing numerous opportunities for authorities to reach this 
      group with preventive and other interventions. Few differences emerged between
      groups with regard to which opioid had contributed to the death.

TI  - The effect of gestational diabetes mellitus on sufentanil consumption after
      cesarean section: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown that patients with long-term diabetes
      require more opioids after surgery than patients without diabetes. Gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) normally only lasts for a brief period; nevertheless, its
      effect on sufentanil consumption after cesarean section is unknown. Methods: This
      prospective cohort study included two groups: a GDM group (n = 32) and a matched 
      non-GDM (NGDM) group (n = 32). All patients underwent routine combined
      spinal-epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Sufentanil consumption through 
      an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, the frequency of PCA
      requests, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores 6 and 24 h after surgery were
      compared between groups. Results: Sufentanil consumption (μg) 6 h after surgery
      was higher in the GDM group than in the NGDM group (24.0 ± 6.6 vs 20.1 ± 5.7,
      P = 0.023). PCA was used more frequently 6 and 24 h after surgery by the GDM
      group than by the NGDM group (1[0–2] vs 0[0–1], P = 0.001; 6 [1–5] vs 3 [1, 2,
      6–8], P = 0.001, respectively). The VAS score during activity 24 h after surgery 
      was higher in the GDM group than in the NGDM group (5 [2, 3] vs 5 [1, 2],
      respectively, P = 0.03). Conclusion: Pregnant women with GDM require more opioids
      during the immediate postoperative period after cesarean section than those
      without GDM. Clinical trials registration: No. ChiCTR1800016014, ChenYang, May

TI  - Facial Nerve Intraoperative Monitoring in Otologic Surgeries under Sedation and
      Local Anesthesia – A Case Series and Literature Review.
PG  - e11-7
AB  - Introduction  Local anesthesia with sedation has been employed for an
      increasingly number of otolaryngology procedures, and might be associated with
      lower surgical morbidity and costs. Facial nerve monitoring is often advisable in
      otology to minimize the risks of injuries to this cranial nerve, but the
      principles, techniques and parameters involved have only been studied for
      procedures under general anesthesia. Objective  To report the preliminary
      outcomes of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring during otologic procedures
      under sedation and local anesthesia. Methods  A total of five procedures and
      their respective intraoperative electrophysiological main findings were
      described. Facial neuromonitoring was performed using the same device by an
      electrophysiologist. The monitor sensitivity was set at 100 mV, and a stimulating
      probe was used whenever needed. Results  Progressively decreasing low-amplitude
      baseline values were usually obtained as the level of anesthesia increased, with 
      isolated oscillations possibly related to some degree of voluntary muscular
      activity. These oscillations could be easily distinguished from those of the
      surgical manipulation or electrical stimulation of the nerve, which tended to be 
      of much greater amplitude and shorter latency, occurring during specific surgical
      steps. Conclusion  With a surgical team with proper procedural knowledge and
      broad expertise regarding the technique, intraoperative facial nerve monitoring
      under local anesthesia with sedation seemed both feasible and reliable. Thus, the
      need for intraoperative neuromonitoring should not be an obstacle for otologic
      procedures under less aggressive anesthetic management.

TI  - Technical and clinical evaluation of a closed loop TIVA system with SEDLineTM
      spectral density monitoring: Multicentric prospective cohort study.
LID - 1
AB  - Introduction: Closed loop total intravenous anesthesia is a technique in which
      the patient’s hemodynamic and anesthetic depth variables are monitored, and based
      on this information, a computer controls the infusion rate of drugs to keep them 
      within pre-established clinical parameters. Objective: To describe the technical 
      and clinical performance of a closed loop system for total intravenous anesthesia
      with propofol and remifentanil, using the SEDLineTM monitor Design: Multicentric 
      prospective cohort study Setting: Surgery room Patients: ASA I-II undergoing
      elective surgery Measurements: The authors designed a closed loop system that
      implements a control algorithm based on anesthetic depth monitoring and the
      Patient State Index (PSITM) of the SEDLine monitor for propofol, and on
      hemodynamic variables for remifentanil. The measurement of clinical performance
      was made based on the percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the range 20–50.
      Precision analysis was evaluated by measuring median performance error (MDPE) can
      be defined as the median difference between actual and desired values, which
      refers to the degree of precision in which the controller is able to maintain the
      control variable within the objective set by the anesthesiologist; it represents 
      the direction (over-prediction or under-prediction) of performance error (PE)
      rather than size of errors, which is represented by MDAPE, median absolute
      percentage error, Wobble index, which is used for measuring the intrasubject
      variability in performance error. Results: Data were obtained from 93 patients in
      three healthcare centers. The percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the 20–50
      range was 92% (80.7–97.0). MDPE was 10.7 (− 11.0–18.0), MDAPE 21.0 (14.2–26.8)
      and wobble 10.7 (7.0–16.9). No adverse surgical or anesthetic events were found. 
      Conclusions: The closed loop total intravenous anesthesia system with SEDLine
      developed by the authors was used without major complication and appear to be
      feasible its use in clinical performance.

TI  - Mortality in a cohort of 3.1 million children, adolescents and young adults.
PG  - 260-8
AB  - Background: Many youth deaths occur in the first year of life, from prematurity
      and anomalies. Detailing mortality after age 1 year may differentially guide
      preventive strategies in children, adolescents and young adults. Methods: A
      cohort study in Ontario, Canada comprised 3 139 698 children born from 1990 to
      2016. Adjusted HR (aHR) for death between 1 and 24 years were generated,
      comparing demographic variables and parity. Results: After a median of 13.7 years
      of follow-up, 6930 deaths occurred between ages 1 and 24 years (incidence rate
      17.0 per 100 000 person-years), peaking at age 23 years (43.7 per 100 000). The
      aHR for death was higher among males than females (1.44, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.51),
      rural versus urban areas (1.48, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.58), lowest versus highest
      income areas (1.39, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51) and at parity 1 (1.16, 95% CI 1.10 to
      1.23), parity 2 (1.34, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.45), parity 3+ (1.96, 95% CI 1.74 to
      2.21), each relative to a child without an older sibling. Among males, the
      proportion of deaths due to injury jumped from 30% before age 15 years to 65%
      thereafter, and in females, from 28% to 51%. Intentional self-harm/assault
      explained 11% of injury-related deaths among males before age 15 years, and 20%
      thereafter, with respective figures of 18% and 17% for females. Deaths outside of
      hospital increased with age, from 35% at age 1 year, to 66% at age 22 years.
      Conclusion: There is a heightened susceptibility of dying starting at age 15
      years, especially among males, from injury, and arising outside of hospital.

      trial of mirtazapine for better treatment of severe breathlessness in advanced
      lung disease (BETTER-B feasibility).
PG  - 176-9
AB  - New treatments are required for severe breathlessness in advanced disease. We
      conducted a randomised feasibility trial of mirtazapine over 28 days in adults
      with a modified medical research council breathlessness scale score ≥3.
      Sixty-four patients were randomised (409 screened), achieving our primary
      feasibility endpoint of recruitment. Most patients had COPD or interstitial lung 
      disease; 52 (81%) completed the trial. There were no differences between placebo 
      and mirtazapine in tolerability or safety, and blinding was maintained. Worst
      breathlessness ratings at day 28 (primary clinical activity endpoint) were, 7.1
      (SD 2.3, placebo) and 6.3 (SD 1.8, mirtazapine). A phase III trial of mirtazapine
      is indicated. Trial registration: ISRCTN 32236160; European Clinical Trials
      Database (EudraCT no: 2015-004064-11).

TI  - Comparison of the Analgesic Effect of Ropivacaine with Fentanyl and Ropivacaine
      Alone in Continuous Epidural Infusion for Acute Herpes Zoster Management: A
      Retrospective Study.
LID - 22
AB  - Background and Objectives: Currently, few studies have reported the effects of
      opioids during continuous epidural infusion (CEI) to control pain owing to herpes
      zoster (HZ). This study aimed to retrospectively compare the effectiveness of
      epidural opioids in the treatment of acute HZ pain. Materials and Methods: We
      reviewed medical records of 105 patients who were divided into two groups: R
      group (CEI with ropivacaine) and RF group (CEI with ropivacaine and fentanyl).
      Clinical efficacy was evaluated using the numeric rating scale (NRS) score for 6 
      months after the procedures. We compared the percentage of patients with complete
      remission in each group. We investigated the complication rates during CEI.
      Results: No significant differences in the NRS scores were observed between the
      two groups in the 6-month period. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for patients
      included in the complete remission was 0.6 times lower in the RF group than in
      the R group (95% confidence interval: 0.22–1.71, p = 0.35). The OR for
      complications during CEI was higher in the RF group than in the R group. However,
      the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: No difference was 
      observed in the management of HZ pain and the prevention of postherpetic
      neuralgia between the two groups. The incidence of complications tended to be
      higher in the RF group than in the R group.

TI  - Equipping Farrowing Pens with Straw Improves Maternal Behavior and Physiology of 
      Min-Pig Hybrid Sows.
LID - 105
AB  - Simple Summary: This study used different sow breeds combined with an enriched
      environment to relieve stress and to improve the welfare level of sows. Both
      groups of sows were in loose-housed pens. Sows living in a barren environment
      (BE) without straw were compared with sows in farrowing crates that received 3.5 
      kg of straw daily (enriched environment (EE)). Compared with BE sows, EE sows
      showed more nest-building behavior prior to farrowing, more nursing behavior, and
      less ventral recumbency behavior during the first three days postpartum.
      Furthermore, compared with BE sows, EE sows tended to have higher concentrations 
      of serum oxytocin and prolactin, while the concentration of cortisol was lower,
      suggesting an increase in maternal behavior and a reduction of stress in this
      group. In addition, the concentration of oxytocin and both the frequency and
      duration of prepartum nest-building behavior were higher in Duroc × Min and
      Landrace × Min sows compared with Landrace × Yorkshire sows. However, the
      concentration of prolactin was significantly lower in both Duroc × Min and
      Landrace × Min sows than in Landrace × Yorkshire sows, indicating that hybrid
      sows of Min-pig inherited good maternal characteristics. Based on these results, 
      straw enrichment improved Min-pig hybrid sow welfare during farrowing and
      lactation. Abstract: This study investigated the effects of two factors, enriched
      environment (EE) and different crossbreeds, on the maternal behavior and
      physiology of Min-pig hybrid sows. The analysis was performed on a total of 72
      multiparous sows, including Duroc × Min pig (DM), Landrace × Min pig (LM), and
      Landrace × Yorkshire (LY) sows, using a total of 24 sows per cross. The sows were
      housed in two different farrowing pens, one with straw (EE) and one without straw
      (barren environment (BE)). The results showed that nest-building behavior,
      including the frequency, total duration, and bout duration, was significantly
      higher in EE sows than in BE sows (p < 0.01). The frequency and duration of
      prepartum nest-building behavior were higher in DM and LM sows than in LY sows (p
      < 0.0001). During the first three days postpartum, EE sows spent a shorter time
      in ventral recumbency compared with BE sows (p < 0.05). The oxytocin (p < 0.05)
      and prolactin (p < 0.01) concentrations of EE sows were significantly higher than
      in BE sows; however, the concentration of cortisol followed the opposite (p <
      0.01). The concentration of oxytocin was significantly higher in DM and LM sows
      than in LY sows (p < 0.01). In conclusion, both EE increased the expression of
      hormones related to parental behaviors and prenatal nesting and nursing behavior 
      of sows. Furthermore, an EE can also reduce stress in sows. Min-pig hybrids may
      inherit highly advantageous characteristics of maternal behavior of Min-pig sows.

TI  - Sensor Technologies to Manage the Physiological Traits of Chronic Pain: A Review.
LID - 365
AB  - Non-oncologic chronic pain is a common high-morbidity impairment worldwide and
      acknowledged as a condition with significant incidence on quality of life. Pain
      intensity is largely perceived as a subjective experience, what makes challenging
      its objective measurement. However, the physiological traces of pain make
      possible its correlation with vital signs, such as heart rate variability, skin
      conductance, electromyogram, etc., or health performance metrics derived from
      daily activity monitoring or facial expressions, which can be acquired with
      diverse sensor technologies and multisensory approaches. As the assessment and
      management of pain are essential issues for a wide range of clinical disorders
      and treatments, this paper reviews different sensor-based approaches applied to
      the objective evaluation of non-oncological chronic pain. The space of available 
      technologies and resources aimed at pain assessment represent a diversified set
      of alternatives that can be exploited to address the multidimensional nature of
      pain.

      the acute treatment of migraine. Background: Ubrogepant is an oral, calcitonin
      gene–related receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of
      migraine. The efficacy of ubrogepant was demonstrated in 2 phase 3 trials in
      which a significant improvement was observed in migraine headache pain,
      migraine‐associated symptoms, and ability to function. Methods: This was a phase 
      3, multicenter, randomized, open‐label, 52‐week extension trial. Adults with
      migraine with or without aura entered the trial after completing one of 2 phase 3
      lead‐in trials and were re‐randomized 1:1:1 to usual care, ubrogepant 50 mg, or
      ubrogepant 100 mg. Randomization to ubrogepant dose was blinded. Those randomized
      to usual care continued to treat migraine attacks with their own medication. The 
      usual care arm was included in this trial to capture background rates of hepatic 
      laboratory parameters and contextualize hepatic safety assessments. Safety and
      tolerability were the primary outcome measures. The safety population for the
      ubrogepant arms included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose
      of treatment. All cases of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST) elevations of ≥3 times the upper limit of normal were
      adjudicated by an independent panel of liver experts who were blinded to dose.
      Results: The safety population included 1230 participants (404 in the ubrogepant 
      50‐mg group, 409 in the ubrogepant 100‐mg group, and 417 in the usual care
      group). Participants were on average 42 years of age, 90% (1106/1230) female and 
      85% (1043/1230) white, with an average BMI of 30 kg/m2. Throughout the trial,
      21,454 migraine attacks were treated with 31,968 doses of ubrogepant.
      Treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 268/404 (66%)
      participants receiving ubrogepant 50 mg and 297/409 (73%) receiving ubrogepant
      100 mg. The most commonly reported TEAE was upper respiratory tract infection
      (<12%); findings were similar across dose groups. Treatment‐related TEAEs were
      reported by 42/404 (10%) participants in the ubrogepant 50‐mg group and 43/409
      (11%) in the ubrogepant 100‐mg group. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported
      by 9/404 (2%) participants in the ubrogepant 50‐mg group and 12/409 (3%)
      participants in the ubrogepant 100‐mg group. Twenty cases of ALT/AST levels of ≥3
      times the upper limit of normal were reported and reviewed by an independent
      clinical adjudication committee of liver experts. There were no cases of Hy’s
      Law. Conclusions: Long‐term intermittent use of ubrogepant 50 and 100 mg given as
      1 or 2 doses per attack for the acute treatment of migraine was safe and well
      tolerated, as indicated by a low incidence of treatment‐related TEAEs and SAEs
      and discontinuations due to adverse events in this 1‐year trial.

TI  - Exploring psychological symptoms and associated factors in patients receiving
      medication-assisted treatment for opioid-use disorder.
LID - e8
AB  - Background: Patients receiving treatment for opioid-use disorder (OUD) may
      experience psychological symptoms without meeting full criteria for psychiatric
      disorders. The impact of these symptoms on treatment outcomes is unclear. Aims:
      To determine the prevalence of psychological symptoms in a cohort of individuals 
      receiving medication-assisted treatment for OUD and explore their association
      with patient characteristics and outcomes in treatment. Method: Data were
      collected from 2788 participants receiving ongoing treatment for OUD recruited in
      two Canadian prospective cohort studies. The Maudsley Addiction Profile
      psychological symptoms subscale was administered to all participants via
      face-to-face interviews. A subset of participants (n = 666) also received
      assessment for psychiatric disorders with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
      Interview. We used linear regression analysis to explore factors associated with 
      psychological symptom score. Results: The mean psychological symptom score was
      12.6/40 (s.d. = 9.2). Participants with psychiatric comorbidity had higher scores
      than those without (mean 16.8 v. 8.6, P<0.001) and 31% of those with psychiatric 
      comorbidity reported suicidal ideation. Higher psychological symptom score was
      associated with female gender (B = 1.59, 95% CI 0.92–2.25, P<0.001),
      antidepressant prescription (B = 4.35, 95% CI 3.61–5.09, P<0.001), percentage of 
      opioid-positive urine screens (B = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01–0.03, P<0.001), and use of
      non-opioid substances (B = 1.92, 95% CI 0.89–2.95, P<0.001). Marriage and
      employment were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusions:
      Psychological symptoms are associated with treatment outcomes in this population 
      and the prevalence of suicidal ideation is an area of concern. Our findings
      highlight the ongoing need to optimise integrated mental health and addictions
      services for patients with OUD.

TI  - Efficacy of lofexidine for mitigating opioid withdrawal symptoms: results from
      two randomized, placebo-controlled trials.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - Objectives: Fear of opioid withdrawal syndrome (OWS) often dissuades opioid
      discontinuation. Lofexidine is an FDA-approved, alpha2-adrenergic receptor
      agonist for treatment of OWS. Pivotal trial results from the per-protocol
      statistical analyses have been published. However, the FDA prescribing
      information presents these efficacy results using a different, standardized
      statistical approach that does not transform data or impute missing values. This 
      analysis is easier to interpret and allows comparison across studies. This
      reanalysis is presented here.Methods: Studies were double-blind,
      placebo-controlled for 7 days in Study 1 and 5 days in Study 2. Opioid-dependent 
      adults received placebo or lofexidine; efficacy was assessed using the Short
      Opioid Withdrawal Scale of Gossop (SOWS-G) daily.Results: Study 1 (N = 602) mean 
      SOWS-G scores were 6.1 (SE: 0.35), 6.5 (SE: 0.34), and 8.8 (SE: 0.47) over Days
      1–7 for lofexidine 2.88 mg/day, 2.16 mg/day, and placebo, respectively (for 2.88,
      p < .0001; for 2.16 mg, p < .0001). Study 2 (N = 264) mean SOWS-G scores were 7.0
      (SE: 0.44) and 8.9 (SE: 0.48) over Days 1–5 for lofexidine 2.16 mg/day and
      placebo, respectively (p = .0037). Median time to treatment discontinuation was
      approximately 2 days later with lofexidine treatment than with placebo and
      significantly more lofexidine-treated subjects completed the studies. Hypotension
      and bradycardia were more common with lofexidine. More placebo subjects withdrew 
      prematurely for lack of efficacy.Conclusion: This simplified analysis confirmed
      previous per-protocol results, that lofexidine better reduces OWS severity and
      increases retention compared with placebo in opioid-dependent adults. These
      results are robust and comparable across studies using various methods of
      analysis. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: Study 1, NCT01863186; Study 2

TI  - Nephrotoxicity in a Patient With Inadequate Pain Control: Potential Role of
      Pharmacogenetic Testing for Cytochrome P450 2D6 and Apolipoprotein L1.
LID - 1511
AB  - A case is presented which demonstrates the perils of opioid inefficacy and how
      pharmacogenomic testing may have prevented nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
      (NSAID)-induced nephrotoxicity and progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). A
      62 year-old female with back pain was treated with tramadol and hydrocodone;
      however, neither proved effective. Consequently, to control her pain, she
      resorted to cocaine, marijuana, and high dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs). She eventually developed CKD. To identify CKD contributors, she
      underwent genotyping for Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1), a known risk factor of CKD,
      as well as relevant pharmacogenomic genes. Her APOL1 genotype was
      *G1(GM)/*G1(GM), placing her at increased risk of CKD progression. Her CYP2D6
      genotype was *5/*17, consistent with intermediate metabolism, making opioid drugs
      reliant on CYP2D6 activation, such as tramadol and hydrocodone, relatively
      ineffective in this patient. Thus, this patient was at genetic risk for CKD and
      reduced opioid efficacy. We conclude that this genetic combination likely
      contributed to opioid inefficacy and the eventual progression to CKD.

TI  - Non-Operating Room Anesthesia: Patient Selection and Special Considerations.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Non-operating room anesthesia (NORA) represents a growing field of medicine with 
      an increasing trend in the number of cases performed over the previous decade. As
      a result, anesthesia providers will need to enhance their familiarity with the
      resources, personnel, and environment outside of the operating room. Anesthesia
      delivery in NORA settings should be held with the same high-quality standards as 
      that within the operating room. This review looks at special considerations in
      patient selection and the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative
      periods. In addition, there is a discussion on the unique aspects of specific
      NORA areas and the considerations that come with them.

TI  - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for Primary Dysmenorrhea: An
      Overview.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Primary dysmenorrhea is a chronic health condition that affects primarily young
      women. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been suggested as
      an effective pain reduction modality in primary dysmenorrhea. TENS is a
      noninvasive, inexpensive, portable method with minimal risks and a few
      contraindications. When necessary, it can be self-administered on a daily basis
      during everyday activities. Several studies have investigated the effectiveness
      of TENS in reducing pain, decreasing the use of analgesics, and improving the
      quality of life in primary dysmenorrhea patients. These studies have some
      limitations in methodological quality and therapeutic validation. However, the
      overall positive effects of TENS in primary dysmenorrhea encountered in all prior
      studies indicated its potential value. This review presents the clinical
      recommendations for TENS parameters for treating primary dysmenorrhea symptoms
      based on previously published studies.

TI  - The INSPIRE Comparative Cost Study: 12-Month Health Economic and Clinical
      Outcomes Associated with Hysterectomy, Myomectomy, and Treatment with the Sonata 
      System.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Purpose: The INSPIRE study compared perioperative and 12-month health economic
      and clinical outcomes associated with hysterectomy, myomectomy, and
      sonography-guided transcervical fibroid ablation (TFA) using the Sonata® system. 
      Patients and Methods: Cost and health care resource utilization (HCRU) data for
      TFA were obtained from a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial.
      Data for hysterectomy and myomectomy arms were derived from the Truven Health
      MarketScan commercial payer claims database. The Truven data was used to
      determine health economic outcomes and costs for the hysterectomy and myomectomy 
      arms. For each arm, payer perspective costs were estimated from the available
      charge and HCRU data. Results: TFA with Sonata had significantly lower mean
      length of stay (LOS) of 5 hrs versus hysterectomy (73 hrs) or myomectomy (79 hrs;
      all p< 0.001). The average payer cost for TFA treatment, including the associated
      postoperative HCRU was $8,941. This was significantly lower compared to
      hysterectomy ($24,156) and myomectomy ($22,784; all p< 0.001). In the TFA arm,
      there were no device- or procedure-related costs associated with complications
      during the peri- or postoperative time frame. TFA subjects had significantly
      lower costs associated with complications, prescription medications, and
      radiology. Conclusion: Compared to hysterectomy and myomectomy, TFA treatment
      with the Sonata system was associated with significantly lower index procedure
      cost, complication cost, and LOS, contributing to a lower total payer cost
      through 12 months.

TI  - The effect of TEAS on the quality of early recovery in patients undergoing
      gynecological laparoscopic surgery: a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled
      trial.
LID - 43
AB  - Introduction: In current study we assessed the effect of transcutaneous
      electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on the quality of early recovery in
      patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Methods: Sixty patients
      undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to TEAS
      (TEAS group) or control group (Con group). TEAS consisted of 30 min of
      stimulation (12–15 mA, 2/100 Hz) at the acupoints of Baihui (GV20), Yingtang
      (EX-HN-3), Zusanli (ST36) and Neiguan (PC6) before anesthesia. The patients in
      the Con group had the electrodes applied, but received no stimulation. Quality of
      recovery was assessed using a 40-item questionnaire as a measure of quality of
      recovery (QoR-40; maximum score 200) scoring system performed on preoperative day
      1 (T0), postoperative day 1 (T1) and postoperative day 2 (T2); 100-mm visual
      analogue scale (VAS) scores at rest, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores,
      the incidence of nausea and vomiting, postoperative pain medications, and
      antiemetics were also recorded. Results: QoR-40 and MMSE scores of T0 showed no
      difference between two groups (QoR-40: 197.50 ± 2.57 vs. 195.83 ± 5.17), (MMSE:
      26.83 ± 2.74 vs. 27.53 ± 2.88). Compared with the Con group, QoR-40 and MMSE
      scores of T1 and T2 were higher in the TEAS group (P < 0.05) (QoR-40: T1,
      166.07 ± 8.44 vs. 175.33 ± 9.66; T2, 187.73 ± 5.47 vs. 191.40 ± 5.74), (MMSE: T1,
      24.60 ± 2.35 vs. 26.10 ± 2.78; T2, 26.53 ± 2.94 vs. 27.83 ± 2.73). VAS scores of 
      T1 and T2 were lower (P < 0.05) in the TEAS group (T1, 4.73 ± 1.53 vs.
      3.70 ± 1.41; T2, 2.30 ± 0.95 vs. 1.83 ± 0.88); the incidence of postoperative
      nausea and vomiting (PONV), remedial antiemetics and remedial analgesia was lower
      in the TEAS group (P < 0.05) (PONV: 56.7% vs. 23.3%; incidence of remedial
      antiemetics: 53.3% vs. 23.3%; incidence of remedial analgesia: 80% vs. 43.3%).
      Conclusion: The use of TEAS significantly promoted the quality of early recovery,
      improved MMSE scores and reduced the incidence of pain, nausea and vomiting in
      patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Trial registration:

TI  - A multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial of rifampin to reduce pedal
      amputations for osteomyelitis in veterans with diabetes (VA INTREPID).
LID - 23
AB  - Background: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus continues to inexorably rise in
      the United States and throughout the world. Lower limb amputations are a
      devastating comorbid complication of diabetes mellitus. Osteomyelitis increases
      the risk of amputation fourfold and commonly presages death.Antimicrobial therapy
      for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) varies greatly, indicating that high
      quality data are needed to inform clinical decision making. Several small trials 
      have indicated that the addition of rifampin to backbone antimicrobial regimens
      for osteomyelitis outside the setting of the diabetic foot results in 28 to 42%
      higher cure rates. Methods/design: This is a prospective, randomized,
      double-blind investigation of the addition of 6 weeks of rifampin, 600 mg daily, 
      vs. matched placebo (riboflavin) to standard-of-care, backbone antimicrobial
      therapy for DFO. The study population are patients enrolled in Veteran Health
      Administration (VHA), ages ≥18 and ≤ 89 years with diabetes mellitus and definite
      or probable osteomyelitis of the foot for whom an extended course of oral or
      intravenous antibiotics is planned. The primary endpoint is amputation-free
      survival. The primary hypothesis is that using rifampin as adjunctive therapy
      will lower the hazard rate compared with the group that does not use rifampin as 
      adjunctive therapy. The primary hypothesis will be tested by means of a two-sided
      log-rank test with a 5% significance level. The test has 90% power to detect a
      hazard ratio of 0.67 or lower with a total of 880 study participants followed on 
      average for 1.8 years. Discussion: VA INTREPID will test if a rifampin-adjunctive
      antibiotic regimen increases amputation-free survival in patients seeking care in
      the VHA with DFO. A positive finding and its adoption by clinicians would reduce 
      lower extremity amputations and their associated physical and emotional impact
      and reduce mortality for Veterans and for the general population with diabetic
      foot osteomyelitis. Given that rifampin-adjunctive regimens are currently
      employed for therapy for the majority of DFO cases in Europe, and only in a small
      minority of cases in the United States, the trial results will impact therapeutic
      decisions, even if the null hypothesis is not rejected. Trial registration:

TI  - Digital pills: a scoping review of the empirical literature and analysis of the
      ethical aspects.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: Digital Pills (DP) are an innovative drug-device technology that
      permits to combine traditional medications with a monitoring system that
      automatically records data about medication adherence as well as patients’
      physiological data. Although DP are a promising innovation in the field of
      digital medicine, their use has also raised a number of ethical concerns. These
      ethical concerns, however, have been expressed principally from a theoretical
      perspective, whereas an ethical analysis with a more empirically oriented
      approach is lacking. There is also a lack of clarity about the empirical evidence
      available concerning the application of this innovative digital medicine.
      Methods: To map the studies where DP have been tested on patients and discuss the
      ethically relevant issues evident therein, we performed a scoping review of the
      empirical literature concerning DP. Results: Our search allowed us to identify 18
      papers reporting on studies where DP were tested on patients. These included
      studies with different designs and involving patients with a variety of
      conditions. In the empirical literature, a number of issues with ethical
      relevance were evident. At the patient level, the ethical issues include users’
      interaction with DP, personal sphere, health-related risks and patients’
      benefits. At the provider level, ethically relevant issues touch upon the
      doctor-patient relationship and the question of data access. At the societal
      level, they concern the benefits to society, the quality of evidence and the
      dichotomy device-medicine. Conclusions: We conclude that evidence concerning DP
      is not robust and that more research should be performed and study results made
      available to evaluate this digital medicine. Moreover, our analysis of the
      ethically relevant aspects within empirical literature underscores that there are
      concrete and specific open questions that should be tackled in the ethical
      discussion about this new technological solution.

TI  - Adding dexmedetomidine to morphine-based analgesia reduces early postoperative
      nausea in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery: a randomized
      controlled trial.
LID - 11
AB  - Background: Few studies have investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine on
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients underwent gynecological
      laparoscopic surgery. We investigated if adding dexmedetomidine to a
      morphine-based patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) could decrease the incidence of
      PONV in this high-risk patient population. Methods: In this prospective,
      randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study, 122 patients underwent
      gynecological laparoscopic surgery were assigned into two groups. Patients in the
      dexmedetomidine group (Group Dex) received a loading dose of dexmedetomidine
      0.4 μg/kg before the end of surgery, followed by morphine 0.5 mg/ml plus
      dexmedetomidine 1 μg/ml for postoperative i.v. PCA. Patients in the control group
      (Group Ctrl) received normal saline before the end of surgery, followed by
      morphine 0.5 mg/ml alone for postoperative i.v. PCA. PCA pump was programmed as
      followed: bolus dose 2 ml, lockout interval 8 min and background infusion at a
      rate of 1 ml/h. The primary outcome was the incidence of nausea and vomiting
      within the first postoperative 24 h. Results: Although there were no significant 
      differences in regard to the total incidence of PONV (41.0% vs 52.5%, P = 0.204),
      PONV score, time to first onset of PONV, or the need for rescue antiemetics
      within the first postoperative 24 h between the two groups, the incidence of
      nausea and total PONV during the first 2 h period was significantly lower in the 
      Group Dex than in the Group Ctrl (9.8% vs 24.6%, P = 0.031 and 0.031,
      respectively). More patients in Group Dex were over sedated or had bradycardia
      during the PACU compared with Group Ctrl (P = 0.040 and 0.036, respectively).
      Conclusion: Our protocol in which dexmedetomidine was administered
      postoperatively – after a loading dose – to intravenous PCA morphine in patients 
      undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery, had only early antiemetic effects,
      while no clinically meaningful antiemetic effect could be evidenced within the
      first 24 h after surgery. Trial registration: Current control trial registered at

TI  - Comparison of effects and safety in providing controlled hypotension during
      surgery between dexmedetomidine and magnesium sulphate: A meta-analysis of
      randomized controlled trials.
LID - e0227410
AB  - Background: Effectiveness of controlled hypotension has been proven in
      alleviating intraoperative bleeding. Many recent studies emphasized the efficacy 
      of dexmedetomidine and magnesium in providing controlled hypotension during
      various surgeries. The present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) was performed to evaluate comprehensively the effects and safety of these 
      two medications. Methods: Literature search was performed in four databases from 
      inception to April 2019. All RCTs that used dexmedetomidine and magnesium as
      hypotensive agents were enrolled. The outcomes contained bleeding condition of
      surgical site, hemodynamic parameters, duration of surgeries, number of patients 
      requiring opioid/analgesia administration, recovery period, and adverse events
      emerged during surgeries. Results: Ten studies with 663 patients met with our
      inclusion criteria. The results indicated that both bleeding score and values of 
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were significantly lower in
      patients receiving dexmedetomidine (SMD 1.65 with 95% CI [0.90,2.41], P<0.00001) 
      compared to the patients receiving magnesium. The effect in decreasing the
      necessity of using opioid/analgesia was affirmative in dexmedetomidine group
      (29.13% with magnesium vs 10.78% with dexmedetomidine), and the condition was
      more favorable in magnesium group in reducing recovery period (SMD -1.98 with 95%
      CI [-4.27,0.30], P = 0.09). Compared with magnesium, using of dexmedetomidine was
      associated with higher incidence of bradycardia but lower incidence of nausea and
      vomiting. Conclusion: Compared with magnesium, dexmedetomidine is more effective 
      to provide promising surgical field condition, favorable controlled hypotension, 
      and less necessity of opioid or analgesia administration. But long recovery
      period and high-probability bradycardia should be deliberated.

TI  - The Brief Measure of Emotional Preoperative Stress (B-MEPS) as a new predictive
      tool for postoperative pain: A prospective observational cohort study.
LID - e0227441
AB  - Background: Preoperative patients’ vulnerabilities such as physical, social, and 
      psychological are implicated in postoperative pain variability. Nevertheless, it 
      is a challenge to analyze a patient's psychological profile in the preoperative
      period in a practical and consistent way. Thus, we sought to identify if high
      preoperative emotional stress, evaluated by the Brief Measure of Emotional
      Preoperative Stress (B-MEPS) scale is associated with higher postoperative pain
      levels and poor rehabilitation in patients submitted to intermediate or major
      surgery. Moreover, the possible neurobiological or neurophysiological mechanisms 
      implicated in high preoperative emotional stress, evaluated through preoperative 
      quantitative sensory pain tests and serum biomarkers BDNF and S100B were
      investigated. Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational, cohort study of
      ASA 2 and 3 adult patients undergoing major urologic, gynecologic, proctologic
      and orthopedic surgeries from March 2017 to March 2018. B-MEPS and Central
      Sensitivity Inventory were evaluated preoperatively, followed by a sequence of
      experimental pain tests and serum biomarkers collection. Postoperative evaluation
      carried out within the first 48 hours after surgery comprehended pain at rest and
      movement-evoked pain, and the consumption of morphine. Quality-of-Recovery was
      also evaluated in the 3rd postoperative day. Results: 23 (15%) out of 150
      patients included in the study presented high emotional preoperative stress.
      Variables significantly related to preoperative stress were: previous psychiatric
      diagnosis and Central Sensitization Inventory result. Mean movement-evoked pain
      in the first 12 to 48 hours was 95–105% higher than pain at rest. A mixed model
      for repeated measures showed a sustainable effect of B-MEPS as a movement-evoked 
      pain predictor. Previous pain, cancer surgery, and preoperative pressure pain
      tolerance were also independent predictors of postoperative pain. Moderate to
      severe postoperative movement-evoked pain was predictive of poor rehabilitation
      in 48 hours after surgery. Conclusion: We confirmed that a brief screening method
      of preoperative emotional states could detect individuals prone to experience
      severe postoperative pain. Specific interventions considering the stress level
      may be planned in the future to improve perioperative outcomes.

TI  - Neonatal abstinence syndrome management in California birth hospitals: results of
      a statewide survey.
PG  - 463-72
AB  - Objective: Assess management of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in California 
      hospitals to identify potential opportunities to expand the use of best
      practices. Study design: We fielded an internet-based survey of 37 questions to
      medical directors or nurse managers at 145 birth hospitals in California.
      Results: Seventy-five participants (52%) responded. Most respondents reported
      having at least one written protocol for managing NAS, but gaps included
      protocols for pharmacologic management. Newer tools for assessing NAS severity
      were not commonly used. About half reported usually or always using
      nonpharmacologic strategies; there is scope for increasing breastfeeding when
      recommended, skin-to-skin care, and rooming-in. Conclusions: We found systematic 
      gaps in care for infants with NAS in a sample of California birth hospitals, as
      well as opportunities to spread best practices. Adoption of new approaches will
      vary across hospitals. A concerted statewide effort to facilitate such
      implementation has strong potential to increase access to evidence-based
      treatment for infants and mothers.

TI  - Anaphylaxis-Induced Atrial Fibrillation and Anesthesia: Pathophysiologic and
      Therapeutic Considerations.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in western society
      affecting more than 35 million individuals worldwide annually. It is a common
      postoperative complication and may also occur spontaneously during general and
      local anesthesia administration. Aging, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
      cardiovascular diseases including cardiomyopathies, congenital cardiac anomalies,
      heart failure, myocardial ischemia, pericarditis, previous cardiac surgery,
      vascular disease, and valvular heart disease are some correlated factors. Beyond 
      age, increased incidence of atrial fibrillation has been correlated to autoimmune
      system activation as it is the underlying mechanism of persistent atrial
      fibrillation development. Current research supports an association between the
      complement system activation and lymphocyte-pro-inflammatory cytokines release
      with the cardiac conduction system and atrial fibrosis. The loss of CD28 antigen 
      from CD4+ CD28+ T lymphocytes seems to play a major role in atrial fibrillation
      development and prognosis. Except atrial fibrillation, a variety of additional
      electrocardiographic changes, resembling those with digitalis intoxication may
      accompany anaphylaxis and particularly Kounis syndrome. Histamine is one
      well-known mediator in allergic and inflammatory conditions as physiologically
      regulates several cardiovascular and endothelial functions with arrhythmogenic
      potential. The increased oxidative stress, measured by the redox potentials of
      glutathione, has been correlated with atrial fibrillation incidence and
      prevalence. The use of antazoline, a first-generation antihistamine agent used
      for rapid conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with
      preserved left ventricular function and for rapid atrial fibrillation termination
      during accessory pathway ablation denotes that anaphylaxis-induced histamine
      production could be the cause of atrial fibrillation at least in some instances. 
      The anaphylaxis diagnosis in anesthesia can be challenging owing to the absence
      of cutaneous manifestetions such as flushing, urticaria, or angioedema.
      Anticoagulation for stroke prevention, rate and rhythm control medications,
      invasive methods such as radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation of pulmonary
      veins as well surgical ablation constitute the treatment basis of atrial
      fibrillation. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of atrial fibrillation by
      cardiologists, anesthesiologists and surgeons, as well as potential treatments,
      to optimize care is of paramount importance.

TI  - Enhanced Recovery and Early Extubation after Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Using
      Single-Dose Intravenous Methadone.
PG  - 70-4
AB  - Background/Aims:: Methadone may offer advantages in facilitating early extubation
      after cardiac surgery, but very few data are available in the pediatric
      population. Setting/Design:: Community tertiary children's hospital,
      retrospective case series. Materials and Methods:: We performed a retrospective
      analysis of all pediatric cardiac surgical patients for whom early extubation was
      intended. A multimodal analgesic regimen was used for all patients, consisting of
      methadone (0.2–0.3 mg/kg), ketamine (0.5 mg/kg plus 0.25 mg/kg/h), lidocaine (1
      mg/kg plus 1.5 mg/kg/h), acetaminophen (15 mg/kg), and parasternal ropivacaine
      (0.5 mL/kg of 0.2%). Outcome variables were collected with descriptive
      statistics. Results:: A total of 24 children [median = 7 (interquartile range =
      3.75–13.75) years old, 23.7 (14.8–53.4) kg] were included in the study; 22 (92%) 
      had procedures performed on bypass and 11 (46%) involved a reentry sternotomy.
      Methadone dosing was 0.26 (0.23–0.29) mg/kg. None of the children required
      intraoperative supplemental opioids; 23 (96%) were extubated in the operating
      room. The first paCO2 on pediatric intensive care unit admission was 51 (45–58)
      mmHg. Time to first supplemental opioid administration was 5.1 (3.5–9.5) h.
      Cumulative total supplemental opioids (in intravenous morphine equivalents) at 24
      and 72 h were 0.2 (0.09–0.32) and 0.42 (0.27–0.68) mg/kg. One child required
      postoperative bilevel positive airway pressure support, but none required
      reintubation. None had pruritus; three (13%) experienced nausea. Conclusion:: A
      methadone-based multimodal regimen facilitated early extubation without
      appreciable adverse events. Further investigations are needed to confirm efficacy
      of this regimen and to assess whether the excellent safety profile seen here
      holds in the hands of multiple providers caring for a larger, more heterogeneous 
      population.

TI  - The Use of Opioids and Antipsychotics in Elderly with Dementia – Have Opioids
      Replaced Antipsychotics in Treating Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia?
PG  - 259-67
AB  - Background:: Opioids are used with increasing frequency. Elderly with dementia
      are prescribed opioids more frequent than elderly without. One possible
      explanation is that opioids may be used not only to treat pain but also
      behavioral symptoms. Objective:: To test the hypothesis that strong opioid use,
      especially transdermal formulations, had increased, especially in elderly with
      dementia, in parallel with a decrease in antipsychotic use. Methods::
      Population-based cross-sectional study conducted using nationwide Danish
      registers with data on Denmark’s entire elderly population age ≥65 (2000:
      n = 802,106; 2015: n = 1,056,476). The registers were used to identify elderly
      with and without dementia and filled prescriptions for opioids and
      antipsychotics. Annual prevalence of opioid and antipsychotic use from 2000–2015 
      was calculated. Results:: Prevalence of opioid use increased by 35% (24.2 to
      32.5%) among elderly with dementia and by 13% among elderly without (14.9 to
      16.8%) from 2000–2015. The disproportionate increase in opioid use among elderly 
      with dementia was mainly driven by an increase in strong opioids (dementia: 11.7 
      to 23.1%; without dementia: 5.9 to 7.4%). Use of antipsychotics decreased during 
      the same period (dementia: 31.3 to 19.3%; no dementia: 4.5 to 2.7%). Conclusion::
      From 2000–2015, use of opioids among the elderly increased with a
      disproportionately higher increase among elderly with dementia. The parallel
      decrease in the use of antipsychotics may suggest that opioids to some extent
      have replaced antipsychotics in managing behavioral symptoms, despite safety
      concerns and lack of evidence for effect of opioids. Future research should focus
      on potential risks associated with increased opioid use.

TI  - Long-Term Trends in Postoperative Opioid Prescribing, 1994 to 2014.
LID - e19.00171
AB  - Opioids are routinely prescribed to manage acute postoperative pain, but changes 
      in postoperative opioid prescribing associated with the marketing of long-acting 
      opioids such as OxyContin have not been described in the surgical
      cohort.Methods:: Using a large commercial claims data set, we studied
      postoperative opioid prescribing after selected common surgical procedures
      between 1994 and 2014. For each procedure and year, we calculated the mean
      postoperative morphine milligram equivalents (MME) filled on the index
      prescription and assessed the proportion of patients who filled a high-dose
      prescription (≥350 MME). We reported changes in postoperative opioid prescribing 
      over time and identified predictors of filling a high-dose postoperative opioid
      prescription. Results:: We identified 1,321,264 adult patients undergoing
      selected common surgical procedures between 1994 and 2014, of whom 80.3% filled a
      postoperative opioid prescription. One in five surgery patients filled a
      high-dose postoperative opioid prescription. Between 1994 and 2014, the mean MME 
      filled increased by 145%, 84%, and 85% for lumbar laminectomy/laminotomy, total
      knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty, respectively. The procedures most 
      likely to be associated with a high-dose opioid fill were all orthopaedic
      procedures (AOR 5.20 to 7.55, P < 0.001 for all). Patients whose postoperative
      opioid prescription included a long-acting formulation had the highest odds of
      filling a prescription that exceeded 350 MME (AOR 32.01, 95% CI, 30.23–33.90).
      Discussion:: After the US introduction of long-acting opioids such as OxyContin, 
      postoperative opioid prescribing in commercially insured patients increased in
      parallel with broader US opioid-prescribing trends, most notably among patients
      undergoing orthopaedic surgical procedures. The increase in the mean annual MME
      filled starting in the late 1990s was driven in part by the higher proportion of 
      long-acting opioid formulations on the index postoperative opioid prescription
      filled by orthopaedic surgery patients.

TI  - Addition of dexmedetomidine to epidural morphine to improve anesthesia and
      analgesia for cesarean section.
PG  - 1747-54
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the 
      combination of epidural dexmedetomidine and morphine in providing anesthesia
      during cesarean surgery and analgesia for post-cesarean pain relief when added to
      epidural ropivacaine. A total of 80 females at term scheduled for elective
      cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to two groups (n=40/group): In the
      morphine group (group M), patients received an epidural injection of 0.75%
      ropivacaine (12 ml) and morphine (2 mg) for surgical anesthesia, and epidural
      infusion of morphine (2 mg) in 100 ml 0.2% ropivacaine at 2 ml/h for 48-h
      post-operative analgesia; and in the morphine combined with dexmedetomidine group
      (group DM), patients received an epidural injection of 0.75% ropivacaine (12 ml) 
      and morphine (2 mg) combined with dexmedetomidine (0.5 µg/kg) for surgical
      anesthesia, and epidural infusion of morphine (2 mg) and dexmedetomidine (200 µg)
      in 100 ml 0.2% ropivacaine at 2 ml/h for 48-h post-operative analgesia. The
      primary outcomes included blockade and analgesic effects, sedation and adverse
      reactions associated with the drugs. Neonatal outcome was also assessed by
      determining the Apgar score and umbilical cord blood analysis. There was no
      significant difference between the groups in the cephalad levels of sensory
      blockade at 20 min post-injection, or in muscle relaxation scores or pain
      intensity scores at rest or upon movement at 4, 12, 24 or 48 h post-injection
      (P>0.05). The maternal patients in the DM group experienced more complete motor
      blockade at 20 min post-injection, better sedation during surgery and following
      delivery, and less visceral pain caused by peritoneal traction during surgery and
      by uterine contraction after delivery, compared with those in group M (P<0.05).
      The patients in group M had a lower incidence and severity score of
      post-operative nausea than those in the DM group (P<0.05). There was no
      significant difference between the groups in terms of Apgar score or umbilical
      cord blood gas values (P>0.05). In conclusion, epidural dexmedetomidine reduces
      intra-operative and post-operative visceral pain and produces better sedation
      during surgery and following delivery, without any significant influence on
      morphine-associated side effects and post-operative analgesia, in females
      undergoing elective cesarean section under epidural anesthesia with morphine and 
      ropivacaine (registration number ChiCTR1900027942; retrospectively registered
      with the Chinese Clinical Registry Center on December 6, 2019).

TI  - Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Neither Improves Survival nor Reduces Myocardial 
      or Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation
      (TAVI).
LID - 160
AB  - Background: Peri-interventional myocardial injury occurs frequently during
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We assessed the effect of remote 
      ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on myocardial injury, acute kidney injury (AKIN) 
      and 6-month mortality in patients undergoing TAVI. Methods: We performed a
      prospective single-center controlled trial. Sixty-six patients treated with RIPC 
      prior to TAVI were enrolled in the study and were matched to a control group by
      propensity-score. RIPC was applied to the upper extremity using a conventional
      tourniquet. Myocardial injury was assessed using high-sensitive troponin-T
      (hsTnT), and kidney injury was assessed using serum creatinine levels. Data were 
      compared with the Wilcoxon-Rank and McNemar tests. Mortality was analysed with
      the log-rank test. Results: TAVI led to a significant rise of hsTnT across all
      patients (p < 0.001). No significant inter-group difference in maximum troponin
      release or areas-under-the-curve was detected. Medtronic CoreValve and Edwards
      Sapien valves showed similar peri-interventional troponin kinetics and patients
      receiving neither valve did benefit from RIPC. AKIN occurred in one RIPC patient 
      and four non-RIPC patients (p = 0.250). No significant difference in 6-month
      mortality was observed. No adverse events related to RIPC were recorded.
      Conclusion: Our data do not show a beneficial role of RIPC in TAVI patients for
      cardio- or renoprotection, or improved survival.

TI  - Prognostic Abilities of Serial Neuron-Specific Enolase and Lactate and their
      Combination in Cardiac Arrest Survivors During Targeted Temperature Management.
LID - 159
AB  - This study aimed to determine the prognostic ability of serial neuron-specific
      enolase (NSE) and lactate in cardiac arrest survivors treated with targeted
      temperature management (TTM) and to investigate whether a combination of NSE and 
      lactate could increase prognostic information. This observational, retrospective,
      cohort study was conducted between January 2013 and December 2018; data were
      extracted from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry. We collected serial
      serum NSE and lactate levels during TTM. The primary endpoint was poor
      neurological outcome at 28 days from cardiac arrest. Of all 160 included
      patients, 98 (61.3%) had poor neurological outcomes. Areas under the curves
      (AUCs) for NSE were 0.797, 0.871, and 0.843 at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively
      (all p < 0.05). AUCs for lactate were 0.669, 0.578, 0.634, and 0.620 at 0, 24,
      48, and 72 h, respectively (all p < 0.05). Although the combination of initial
      lactate and NSE at 48 h yielded the highest discovered AUC (0.877) it was not
      statistically different from that for the 48 h NSE alone (p = 0.692). During the 
      TTM, NSE at 48 h from cardiac arrest was the most robust prognostic marker in
      comatose cardiac arrest survivors. However, a combination of the 48 h NSE with
      lactate did not increase the prognostic information.

TI  - The Effect of a Transdermal Scopolamine Patch on Postoperative Nausea and
      Vomiting after Retromastoid Craniectomy with Microvascular Decompression: A
      Preliminary Single Center, Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 156
AB  - Background: We performed this prospective double-blind randomized controlled
      trial to identify the effect of a preoperative prophylactic transdermal
      scopolamine (TDS) patch on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after
      retromastoid craniectomy with microvascular decompression (RMC-MVD). Methods: We 
      recruited 38 patients undergoing RMC-MVD and randomized them into two groups: the
      TDS group (n = 19, application of the TDS patch) and placebo group (n = 19,
      application of a sham patch). Nausea (as a self-reported 100-mm visual analog
      scale (VAS) score; range, 0 (no nausea) to 10 (worst nausea)), vomiting, and the 
      use of antiemetics were the primary endpoints. Results: There was no significant 
      difference in terms of the incidence of PONV (73.7% in the TDS group and 78.9% in
      the placebo group; p = 1.00) between the groups. However, the mean nausea VAS
      score was significantly different at arrival to the general ward (0.93 ± 1.71 in 
      the TDS group vs. 2.52 ± 2.85 in the placebo group; p = 0.046), and throughout
      the study period (0.03 ± 0.07 in the TDS group vs. 0.44 ± 0.71 in the placebo
      group; p = 0.029). Rescue antiemetics were more frequently used in the placebo
      group than in the TDS group (9 (47.4%) vs. 2 (10.5%), respectively; p = 0.029).
      The mean number of antiemetics used throughout the study period was significantly
      higher in the placebo group than in the TDS group (1.37 ± 2.19 vs. 0.16 ± 0.50,
      respectively; p = 0.029). Conclusions: The preoperative prophylactic use of a TDS
      patch was safe and effective in the management of PONV after RMC-MVD in terms of 
      the severity of PONV and the use of rescue antiemetics.

TI  - Gender Informed or Gender Ignored? Opportunities for Gender Transformative
      Approaches in Brief Alcohol Interventions on College Campuses.
LID - 396
AB  - Brief alcohol interventions are an effective strategy for reducing harmful and
      risky alcohol use and misuse. Many effective brief alcohol interventions include 
      information and advice about an individual’s alcohol use, changing their use, and
      assistance in developing strategies and goals to help reduce their use. Emerging 
      research suggests that brief interventions can also be expanded to address
      multiple health outcomes; recognizing that the flexible nature of these
      approaches can be helpful in tailoring information to specific population groups.
      This scoping review synthesizes evidence on the inclusion of sex and gender in
      brief alcohol interventions on college campuses, highlighting available evidence 
      on gender responsiveness in these interventions. Furthermore, this scoping review
      offers strategies on how brief alcohol interventions can be gender
      transformative, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of brief alcohol
      interventions as harm reduction and prevention strategies, and in promoting
      gender equity.

TI  - Improving timely analgesia administration for musculoskeletal pain in the
      emergency department.
LID - e000797
AB  - Delays to adequate analgesia result in worse patient care, decreased patient and 
      provider satisfaction and increased patient complaints. The leading presenting
      symptom to emergency departments (EDs) is pain, with approximately 34 000 such
      patients per year in our academic hospital ED and 3300 visits specific for
      musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. Our aim was to reduce the time-to-analgesia (TTA;
      time from patient triage to receipt of analgesia) for patients with MSK pain in
      our ED by 55% (to under 60 min) in 9 months’ time (May 2018). Our outcome
      measures included mean TTA and ED length of stay (LOS). Process measures included
      rates of analgesia administration and of use of medical directives. We obtained
      weekly data capture for Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts, as well as
      Mann-Whitney U tests for before-and-after evaluation. We performed wide
      stakeholder engagement, root cause analyses and created a Pareto Diagram to
      inform Plan–Do–Study–Act (PDSA) cycles, which included: (1) nurse-initiated
      analgesia at triage; (2) a new triage documentation aid for medication
      administration; (3) a quick reference medical directive badge for nurses; and (4)
      weekly targeted feedback of the project’s progress at clinical team huddle. TTA
      decreased from 129 min (n=153) to 100 min (22.5%; n=87, p<0.05). Special cause
      variation was identified on the ED LOS SPC chart with nine values below the
      midline after the first PDSA. The number of patients that received any analgesia 
      increased from 42% (n=372) to 47% (n=192; p=0.13) and those that received them
      via medical directives increased from 22% (n=154) to 44% (n=87; p<0.001). We
      achieved a significant reduction of TTA and an increased use of medical
      directives through front-line focused improvements.

TI  - A Case of Kratom-induced Seizures.
LID - e6588
AB  - Kratom or Mitragna speciosa is a tropical tree that is indigenous to Southeast
      Asia, where it has been used for various medicinal reasons. In the West, it is
      used in the self-treatment of opioid withdrawal, pain, and a variety of mood and 
      anxiety states. Two active ingredients in kratom are mitragynine and
      7-hydroxymitragynine, which have affinity at the mu-opioid receptor among others.
      Kratom is easily available over the Internet and its use is increasing in the
      United States. It is currently listed by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a
      drug of concern. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration started issuing a
      series of warnings about kratom, and by early 2018, it released a statement
      identifying 44 deaths related to kratom use. The Centers for Disease Control and 
      Prevention has also reported 91 deaths directly linked to kratom use in 2019.
      Although its safety profile needs additional research for clarification, there
      have been reports of kratom-induced or kratom-related respiratory depression,
      hypothyroidism, secondary hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, psychosis, and
      seizures. We report a case of kratom-induced tonic-clonic seizures in a
      27-year-old Caucasian male with a psychiatric history of anxiety,
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine use disorder, and opioid
      use disorder. He was hospitalized after a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure. There
      was no significant metabolic abnormality on laboratory testing. Spinal cord and
      brain imaging were unremarkable, whereas his urine toxicology was positive for
      opioids only, which was likely a false-positive result due to cross-reactivity
      with his sleeping aids. He was evaluated by the Consultation-Liaison
      Psychiatry team for psychotic symptoms. On evaluation, the patient’s psychosis
      had resolved, but he endorsed racing thoughts, significant anxiety, and insomnia.
      He admitted to drinking three to four 8-mL bottles of Kratom daily for
      one-and-a-half years to self-medicate his anxiety after losing his health
      insurance. In the hospital, he was treated with anxiolytics, counseled to abstain
      from Kratom use, and was referred for substance use disorder treatment. This case
      highlights the life-threatening complications of Kratom that is easily available 
      online.

TI  - Respiratory Rate Monitoring in Clinical Environments with a Contactless
      Ultra-Wideband Impulse Radar-based Sensor System.
PG  - 3366-75
AB  - Respiratory rate is an extremely important but poorly monitored vital sign for
      medical conditions. Current modalities for respiratory monitoring are suboptimal.
      This paper presents a proof of concept of a new algorithm using a contactless
      ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radar-based sensor to detect respiratory rate in
      both a laboratory setting and in a two-subject case study in the Emergency
      Department. This novel approach has shown correlation with manual respiratory
      rate in the laboratory setting and shows promise in Emergency Department
      subjects. In order to improve respiratory rate monitoring, the UWB technology is 
      also able to localize subject movement throughout the room. This technology has
      potential for utilization both in and out of the hospital environments to improve
      monitoring and to prevent morbidity and mortality from a variety of medical

PG  - 3488-96
AB  - The opioid epidemic is a growing public health emergency in the United States,
      with deaths from opioid overdose having increased five-fold since 1999. Emergency
      departments (EDs) are the primary sites of medical care after near-fatal opioid
      overdose but are poorly equipped to provide adequate substance use treatment
      planning prior to discharge. In many underserved locales, limited access to
      clinicians trained in addiction medicine and behavioral health exacerbates this
      disparity. In an effort to improve post-overdose care in the ED, we developed a
      telemedicine protocol to facilitate timely access to substance use disorder
      evaluations. In this paper, we describe the conception and refinement of the
      telemedicine program, our experience with the first 20 participants, and
      potential implications of the platform on health disparities for individuals with
      opioid use disorder.

TI  - Analysis of Anesthesia Methods in Percutaneous Kyphoplasty for Treatment of
      Vertebral Compression Fractures.
LID - 3965961
AB  - Aim: Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) is a routine operation for the treatment of
      vertebral compression fracture (VCF). Both local anesthesia and general
      anesthesia are widely used for PKP. However, which type of anesthesia is better
      for PKP still remains uncertain. This study aimed to find out whether local
      anesthesia or general anesthesia is more suitable for PKP. Methods: This is a
      retrospective clinical trial. A total of 85 single-level VCF patients who
      received PKP 12 months ago were recruited in this study. 45 patients who received
      local anesthesia were in group L, and 40 patients with general anesthesia were in
      group G. Clinical, radiological, and economic data between the two groups were
      collected. Results: No difference was found on preoperative data between the two 
      groups. The duration of operation time in group L was longer than that in group
      G. Within 12 months after PKP, more complications happened in group G than those 
      in group L. Results: No difference was found on preoperative data between the two
      groups. The duration of operation time in group L was longer than that in group
      G. Within 12 months after PKP, more complications happened in group G than those 
      in group L. Conclusion: Both local anesthesia and general anesthesia were
      reliable for PKP. However, local anesthesia was more efficient and safer with
      less expense and more bearable pain when compared with general anesthesia.

TI  - Systemic lidocaine versus ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block for
      postoperative analgesia: A comparative randomised study in bariatric surgical
      patients.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - Background and Aims:: The multimodal analgesia strategies to minimise
      opioid-related side effects are highly desirable in bariatric surgical
      procedures. We evaluated the efficacy of ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis 
      plane (USG-TAP) block and intravenous lidocaine for postoperative analgesia in
      obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Methods:: We studied 56
      patients with body mass index >35 kg/m2. They were randomly allocated to
      Lidocaine group (Group A) and USG-TAP group (Group B). Group A patients were
      given intravenous Lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) bolus followed by (1.5 mg/kg/h) infusion.
      Group B patients were given ultrasound-guided bilateral TAP block using 20 cc of 
      0.375% ropivacaine each side. Postoperative numeric rating pain scale score (NRS)
      hours were compared. Other parameters compared were total fentanyl requirement,
      sedation score, postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV) score and patient
      satisfaction score. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
      Results:: The patient in the Group A had lower resting NRS score (P < 0.05)
      postoperatively and less fentanyl consumption (P < 0.001) than in Group B. The
      difference in the sedation scores (P = 0.161) and PONV (P = 0.293) score was
      found to be statistically insignificant between Group A and B. The difference
      between the two groups was statistically significant with respect to patient
      satisfaction score with majority of patients having an excellent patient
      satisfaction score in Group A as compared to Group B. Conclusion:: Intravenous
      Lidocaine as part of multimodal analgesic technique in obese patients undergoing 
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery improves pain score and reduces opioid requirement
      as compared to USG-TAP Block.

TI  - Controlled hypotension for FESS: A randomised double-blinded comparison of
      magnesium sulphate and dexmedetomidine.
PG  - 24-30
AB  - Background and Aims:: Intense bleeding during general anaesthesia (GA) is the
      major limitation during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). This study
      was aimed to compare the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and magnesium sulphate
      (MgSO4) for controlled hypotension in FESS. Methods:: Sixty eight patients
      undergoing FESS were randomised to receive either dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg over 10
      min followed by infusion at 0.2 to 0.7 μg/kg/h (Group D) or MgSO4 40 mg/kg over
      10 min followed by an infusion at 10 to 15 mg/kg/h (Group M). Anaesthesia and
      infusion rates for study drugs were maintained with sevoflurane to keep MAP
      between 60–70 mmHg throughout the surgery. The time to reach the target MAP, the 
      number of patients requiring a minimum and maximum infusion doses of study drugs 
      were noted. Results:: The mean time to achieve target mean arterial pressure
      (MAP) was less in group D (10.59 ± 2.04) as compared with (21.32 ± 4.65 min)
      group M (P < 0.001). The target MAP was achieved between 5–15 min in 73.52%
      patients (Group D) with an infusion dose of 0.2–0.4 μg/kg/h of dexmedetomidine
      without the use of sevoflurane, while 82.35% patients in group M required 4%
      sevoflurane along with >12–15 mg/kg/hr infusion of MgSO4 to achieve target MAP in
      10–20 min. Conclusion:: Dexmedetomidine is superior to MgSO4 in achieving target 
      MAP in lesser time with minimum infusion dose.

TI  - Post-operative analgesic effect of intraperitoneal ropivacaine with or without
      tramadol in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
PG  - 43-8
AB  - Background and Aims:: Intraperitoneal instillation of local anaesthetics has been
      shown to minimise post-operative pain after laparoscopic surgery. This study was 
      aimed to evaluate the post-operative effect of intraperitoneal ropivacaine with
      and without tramadol in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
      Methods:: Eighty patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised
      into two groups. Group R received 0.5% ropivacaine 18 mL with normal saline (NS) 
      2 mL and Group RT received 0.5% ropivacaine 18 mL with tramadol (100 mg, 2 mL) at
      the end of surgery intraperitoneally through the port. The pain score was
      monitored using a numerical rating scale (NRS) every 30 min till 4 h
      post-operatively and then at 6 h, 12 h and 24 h. The primary objective of the
      study was to compare the severity of pain between the groups. The secondary
      objectives were to compare the total dose of rescue analgesic and the time
      tofirst rescue analgesia between the groups Statistical analysis was performed
      using statistical package for the social sciences. Chi-square test and Mann
      Whitney U test were used for analysis. Results:: The pain score in Group RT was
      significantly lower than Group R at 2.5 h to 24 h (P = 0.005). Only 42.5% in
      Group RT demanded rescue analgesia as compared to 75% in Group R (P = 0.003).
      Total analgesic consumption of fentanyl was also reduced in the tramadol group
      (785 μg vs 1800 μg). No significant adverse effects were found. Conclusion::
      Intraperitoneal instillation of ropivacaine with tramadol reduces the
      post-operative pain and analgesic requirement in laparoscopic cholecystectomy as 
      compared to ropivacaine alone.

TI  - Comparison of ultrasound-guided intermediate vs subcutaneous cervical plexus
      block for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy: A
      randomised double-blind trial.
PG  - 37-42
AB  - Background and Aims:: Intermediate cervical plexus block (CPB) is a new procedure
      whose analgesic efficacy compared to superficial cervical plexus block is yet to 
      be established. We compared the analgesic efficacy of superficial vs intermediate
      CPB for post-operative analgesia after thyroid surgery. Methods:: Forty-five
      patients with American Society of Anaesthesiologists' physical status 1 or 2
      undergoing total thyroidectomy were recruited. Forty-four patients in
      superficial/subcutaneous CPB group (n = 22) and intermediate CPB (n = 22)
      received 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine with adrenaline 100 μg bilaterally in
      ultrasound-guided superficial and intermediate cervical plexus block before
      induction of general anaesthesia., respectively. The primary outcome measure was 
      the postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24.
      Secondary outcome measures included the total dose of rescue analgesic required, 
      duration of postoperative analgesia and patient's satisfaction score. Statistical
      analysis was with the Mann-Whitney U test and independent t-test. Results:: The
      post-operative VAS scores were lower in intermediate CPB group compared to
      superficial CPB group at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h [P < 0.05]. Time tofirst rescue
      analgesic demand was prolonged 10.06 ± 3.62 h in intermediate group compared to
      7.94 ± 3.62 h in superficial group [P = 0.017] and total analgesic consumption
      were lower in intermediate group (71.25 ± 16.70 μg) than the superficial group
      (101.25 ± 50.31 μg) [P = 0.011]. Conclusion:: Ultrasound-guided intermediate CPB 
      reduces post-operative pain scores, prolongs duration of analgesia and decreases 
      demands for rescue analgesia compared to superficial CPB.

TI  - No Differences in the Prevalence and Intensity of Chronic Postsurgical Pain
      Between Laparoscopic Hysterectomy and Abdominal Hysterectomy: A Prospective
      Study.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Objective: To compare the prevalence and characteristics of chronic postsurgical 
      pain (CPSP) between laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) and abdominal hysterectomy
      (AH) groups 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, and to assess the impact of pain
      on the activities of daily living (ADL) of patients. Methods: The demographic
      characteristics, intraoperative clinical factors, and postoperative pain score
      were collected prospectively in patients scheduled for elective LH or AH for
      benign disease at our institution from July 2014 to June 2015. Patients were
      interviewed by telephone and followed up for pain assessment 3, 6, and 12 months 
      after surgery. The prevalence, intensity, and specific locations of pain, as well
      as analgesic administration and impact on the ADL, were included in the
      questionnaire. Results: The results from 406 patients (225 patients in the LH
      group and 181 patients in the AH group) were obtained. Three months after
      surgery, the prevalence of CPSP was 20.9% in the LH group and 20.4% in the AH
      group. At 6 months, the prevalence of pain declined to 11.6% in the LH group and 
      9.4% in the AH group. At 12 months after surgery, only 13 (5.8%) patients in the 
      LH group and 11 (6.1%) patients in the AH group complained about persistent pain.
      The prevalence of CPSP, as well as the average numerical rating scale pain scores
      at rest and during movement, during 12 months after surgery were not
      significantly different between the groups. CPSP after hysterectomy exhibited a
      negative impact on the ADL. Conclusion: The prevalence and intensity of CPSP were
      not significantly different between patients undergoing LH or AH within 12 months
      after surgery. A tendency towards a reduction in chronic pain over time was
      documented. Chronic post-hysterectomy pain exhibited a negative impact on the
      ADL.

TI  - Enhanced External Counterpulsation Efficacy on Exercise Endurance in COPD
      Patients and Healthy Subjects: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - Purpose: Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is popular in China for the
      treatment of coronary heart diseases, but it may be an effective treatment for
      other populations. This study aimed to explore the effect of EECP on exercise
      endurance of healthy people and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      patients and provide intervention measures to improve their physical condition.
      Patients and methods: Patients were enrolled in this pilot randomized controlled 
      trial at Jiangbin Hospital, China, between March 1st and May 30th, 2018. They
      were randomly divided into the EECP and non-EECP groups. According to their
      maximal oxygen uptake, the volunteers were also sub-grouped into the normal, low 
      exercise endurance, and COPD subgroups. Differences in exercise endurance were
      evaluated between the EECP and non-EECP groups before and after treatment.
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testng included anaerobic threshold oxygen uptake
      (AT-VO2Kg), maximum oxygen uptake (Max-VO2Kg), anaerobic threshold pulse
      (AT-O2puls), anaerobic threshold metabolic equivalent (AT-Mets), and maximum
      metabolic equivalent (Max-Mets). Results: 72 volunteers were enrolled. The EECP
      and non-EECP groups were similar in terms of age, sex, body mass index, blood
      pressure, heart rate, breathing frequency, AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg, AT-O2puls,
      AT-Mets, and Max-Mets (P > 0.05) before treatment. EECP significantly improved
      AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg, AT-O2puls, AT-Mets, and Max-Mets compared with the non-EECP 
      group (P<0.05). When analyzed according to sub-groups, the AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg,
      AT-O2puls, AT-Mets, and Max-Mets of the normal, low exercise endurance, and COPD 
      subgroups were all significantly increased after EECP (P<0.05). Conclusion: EECP 
      significantly improved the exercise endurance of normal adults, low endurance
      adults, and COPD patients. Registration number: ChiCTR1900021993.

TI  - EEG alpha activity increased in response to transcutaneous electrical nervous
      stimulation in young healthy subjects but not in the healthy elderly.
LID - e8330
AB  - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is used not only in the
      treatment of pain but also in the examination of sensory functions. With aging,
      there is decreased sensitivity to somatosensory stimuli. It is essential to
      examine the effect of TENS application on the sensory functions in the brain by
      recording the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and the effect of
      aging on the sensory functions of the brain during the application. The present
      study aimed to investigate the effect of the application of TENS on the brain’s
      electrical activity and the effect of aging on the sensory functions of the brain
      during application of TENS. A total of 15 young (24.2 ± 3.59) and 14 elderly
      (65.64 ± 4.92) subjects were included in the study. Spontaneous EEG was recorded 
      from 32 channels during TENS application. Power spectrum analysis was performed
      by Fast Fourier Transform in the alpha frequency band (8–13 Hz) for all subjects.
      Repeated measures of analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis (p < 
      0.05). Young subjects had increased alpha power during the TENS application and
      had gradually increased alpha power by increasing the current intensity of TENS
      (p = 0.035). Young subjects had higher alpha power than elderly subjects in the
      occipital and parietal locations (p = 0.073). We can, therefore, conclude that
      TENS indicated increased alpha activity in young subjects. Young subjects had
      higher alpha activity than elderly subjects in the occipital and somatosensory
      areas. To our knowledge, the present study is one of the first studies examining 
      the effect of TENS on spontaneous EEG in healthy subjects. Based on the results
      of the present study, TENS may be used as an objective method for the examination
      of sensory impairments, and in the evaluative efficiency of the treatment of pain
      conditions.

TI  - Identifying appropriate outcomes to help evaluate the impact of the Canadian
      Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for Non-Cancer Pain.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: The Canadian Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for
      Chronic Non-Cancer Pain (COG) was developed in response to increasing rates of
      opioid-related hospital visits and deaths in Canada, and uncertain benefits of
      opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Following publication, we developed a
      list of evaluable outcomes to assess the impact of this guideline on practice and
      patient outcomes. Methods: A working group at the National Pain Centre at
      McMaster University used a modified Delphi process to construct a list of
      clinical and patient outcomes important in assessing the uptake and application
      of the COG. An advisory group then reviewed this list to determine the relevance 
      and feasibility of each outcome, and identified potential data sources. This
      feedback was reviewed by the National Faculty for the Guideline, and a National
      Advisory Group that included the creators of the COG, resulting in the final list
      of 5 priority outcomes. Results: Five outcomes were judged clinically important
      and feasible to measure: 1) Effects of opioids for CNCP on quality of life, 2)
      Assessment of patient’s risk of addiction before starting opioid therapy, 3)
      Monitoring patients on opioid therapy for aberrant drug-related behaviour, 4)
      Mortality rates associated with prescription opioid overdose and 5) Use of
      treatment agreements with patients before initiating opioid therapy for CNCP.
      Data sources for these outcomes included patient’s medical charts, e-Opioid
      Manager, prescription monitoring programs and administrative databases.
      Conclusion: Measuring the impact of best practice guidelines is infrequently
      done. Future research should consider capturing the five outcomes identified in
      this study to evaluate the impact of the COG in promoting evidence-based use of
      opioids for CNCP.

TI  - Why Are Women Prone to Restless Legs Syndrome?
LID - 368
AB  - Restless legs syndrome is a relatively common neurologic disorder considerably
      more prevalent in women than in men. It is characterized by an
      inactivity-induced, mostly nocturnal, uncomfortable sensation in the legs and an 
      urge to move them to make the disagreeable sensation disappear. Some known genes 
      contribute to this disorder and the same genes contribute to an overlapping
      condition—periodic leg movements that occur during sleep and result in insomnia. 
      Dopamine and glutamate transmission in the central nervous system are involved in
      the pathophysiology, and an iron deficiency has been shown in region-specific
      areas of the brain. A review of the literature shows that pregnant women are at
      particular risk and that increased parity is a predisposing factor.
      Paradoxically, menopause increases the prevalence and severity of symptoms. This 
      implies a complex role for reproductive hormones. It suggests that changes rather
      than absolute levels of estrogen may be responsible for the initiation of
      symptoms. Both iron (at relatively low levels in women) and estrogen (at
      relatively high oscillating levels in women) influence dopamine and glutamate
      transmission, which may help to explain women’s vulnerability to this condition. 
      The syndrome is comorbid with several disorders (such as migraine, depression,
      and anxiety) to which women are particularly prone. This implies that the
      comorbid condition or its treatment, or both, contribute to the much higher
      prevalence in women than in men of restless legs syndrome.

TI  - Toward precision adjuvants: optimizing science and safety.
PG  - 125-38
AB  - Purpose of review: The gradual replacement of inactivated whole cell and live
      attenuated vaccines with subunit vaccines has generally reduced reactogenicity
      but in many cases also immunogenicity. Although only used when necessary,
      adjuvants can be key to vaccine dose/antigen-sparing, broadening immune responses
      to variable antigens, and enhancing immunogenicity in vulnerable populations with
      distinct immunity. Licensed vaccines contain an increasing variety of adjuvants, 
      with a growing pipeline of adjuvanted vaccines under development. Recent
      findings: Most adjuvants, including Alum, Toll-like receptor agonists and
      oil-in-water emulsions, activate innate immunity thereby altering the quantity
      and quality of an adaptive immune response. Adjuvants activate leukocytes, and
      induce mediators (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandin-E2) some of
      which are biomarkers for reactogenicity, that is, induction of local/systemic
      side effects. Although there have been safety concerns regarding a hypothetical
      risk of adjuvants inducing auto-immunity, such associations have not been
      established. As immune responses vary by population (e.g., age and sex), adjuvant
      research now incorporates principles of precision medicine. Innovations in
      adjuvant research include use of human in vitro models, immuno-engineering, novel
      delivery systems, and systems biology to identify biomarkers of safety and
      adjuvanticity. Summary: Adjuvants enhance vaccine immunogenicity and can be
      associated with reactogenicity. Novel multidisciplinary approaches hold promise
      to accelerate and de-risk targeted adjuvant discovery and development. Video

      patient with Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 112-4
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the
      extrapyramidal system, and respiratory dysfunction has also been noted in
      patients with PD. However, acute upper airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal 
      cord paralysis is a very rare finding in PD. Here, we describe a rare
      life-threatening respiratory failure caused by bilateral vocal cord paralysis in 
      an elderly woman with PD during emergence from general anesthesia. The
      tracheostomy was performed on the postoperative period because the condition
      persisted. The general anesthesia in PD may have aggravated vocal cord
      impairment. We recommend when a patient with PD is scheduled for general
      anesthesia that the anesthesiologist performs careful preoperative examinations, 
      strictly monitors respiratory function, and rapidly manages acute upper airway
      obstruction.

TI  - Epidural administration of ropivacaine and its effects on the pharmacodynamics of
      rocuronium: Randomized controlled trial. Interaction between ropivacaine and
      rocuronium.
PG  - 63-8
AB  - Background:: Potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents by local anesthetics
      has been described in various clinical and experimental studies. This study
      assessed the influence of epidural ropivacaine on pharmacodynamic characteristics
      of rocuronium. Design:: This was a prospective randomized clinical trial at the
      women's hospital, an university tertiary hospital in Brazil. Sixty-two patients
      underwent elective abdominal surgeries requiring general anesthesia.
      Intervention:: Patients were distributed into two groups: Group 1 (general
      anesthesia and epidural anesthesia) and Group 2 (general anesthesia). In Group 1,
      0.2% ropivacaine at a dose of 40 mg (20 ml) was associated with 2 mg (2 ml) of
      morphine in a single epidural injection. The following parameters were assessed: 
      clinical duration (DC25) and time for recovery of the train-of-four (TOF) 0.9
      ratio (T4/T1 = 90%) after an initial 0.6 mg/kg dose of rocuronium. The primary
      outcomes were DC25 and TOF 0.9 ratio (T4/T1 = 90%). Secondary outcomes were total
      propofol and remifentanil consumption. Results:: Values were presented as median 
      and interquartile range. The results for DC25 and TOF 0.9 of rocuronium were,
      respectively, 41.5 35.0–55.0 (25.0–63.0) in Group 1 and 44.0 37.0-51.0
      (20.0–67.0) in Group 2 (P = 0.88); 88.0 67.0–99.0 (43.0–137.0) in Group 1; and
      80.0 71.0-86.0 (38.0–155.0) in Group 2 (P = 0.83). There was no significant
      difference between the groups, in terms of pharmacodynamic characteristics of
      rocuronium. Propofol consumption did not show any difference between the groups. 
      However, remifentanil consumption was significantly lower in Group 1 (P < 0.01). 
      Conclusion:: Epidural ropivacaine, in the dose studied, did not prolong the
      duration of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. Trial Registry Number::
      ReBEC (ref: RBR-7cyp6t).

TI  - Post-operative analgesia techniques after total knee arthroplasty: A narrative
      review.
PG  - 85-90
AB  - Post-operative knee pain management has become a challenge to provide early
      relief and pain-free postoperative care to the patient. The major objectives of
      post-operative analgesic treatment are to reduce opioid requirements,
      post-operative pain, and adverse events related to opioid intake. This narrative 
      review aimed to document post-operative analgesia techniques after total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA). The traditional approach involved high-dose opioid-based
      regimen, though opioid is considered strong analgesic, but are associated with a 
      number of unwanted side effects to seek for alternative techniques. The role of
      sciatic nerve block in TKA pain is doubtful. Femoral Nerve Block (FNB) is still
      considered as the gold standard; however, FNB is associated with quadriceps
      weakness and risk of fall and sciatic block with foot drop. To overcome these
      drawback more distal nerve block techniques has evolved, namely saphenous nerve
      block in adductor canal, selective tibial which are claimed to provide comparable
      analgesia to that of femoral and sciatic nerve block. The combination of
      pre-emptive and multi-modal analgesia and technically well-delivered regional
      nerve blocks and postoperative physical therapy are an essential component which 
      not only minimize the side effects of traditional opioid-based analgesia but also
      speed up functional recovery, increases patient satisfaction, and reduces the
      overall length of hospitalization and cost.

TI  - Review of adjuvants to local anesthetics in peripheral nerve blocks: Current and 
      future trends.
PG  - 77-84
AB  - In recent anesthetic practice, peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) are used
      extensively for surgical anesthesia and nonsurgical analgesia. PNBs offer many
      benefits over other anesthetic techniques in a certain population of patients,
      and in some specific clinical setting, that may contribute to faster and safer
      pain relief, increased patient satisfaction, reduced hospital stay, and decreased
      overall healthcare cost. The technique involves the injection of the anesthetic
      in the vicinity of a specific nerve or bundle of nerves to block the sensation of
      pain transmitting to a specific portion of the body. However, the length of
      analgesia when a single anesthetic is used for PNB may not last long. Therefore, 
      the practice of adding an additional agent called adjuvant has been evolved to
      prolong the analgesic effect. There are many such adjuvants available that are
      clinically being used for this purpose imparting great efficacy and safety to the
      anesthetic process. The adjuvants molecules are generally classified as opioids, 
      alpha-2 agonist, steroids, etc. Most of them are safe to use and show little or
      no adverse event related to neurotoxicity and tissue damage. Although there is
      extensive use of such adjuvants in the clinical field, none of the molecules is
      approved by the FDA and is used as an off-label drug. The risk to benefit ratio
      must be assessed while using such an agent. This review will try to delineate the
      basic need of adjuvant in peripheral nerve block and will discuss the advantages 
      and limitations of using different adjuvants and will discuss the future prospect
      of such application.

TI  - Efficacy of single-shot ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block for
      postoperative analgesia after mastectomy: A randomized controlled study.
PG  - 22-7
AB  - Background:: The aim of this study is to understand the effect of ultrasound (US)
      guided erector spinae plane block (ESPB) in improving the intraoperative and
      postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing mastectomies, decreasing the use
      of opioids and in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting. Methods:: After
      local ethics committee approval, 100 patients were divided randomly into two
      groups. Group A with 50 patients received US guided ESPB with 30 ml of 0.25% of
      bupivacaine under US guidance. Group B with 50 patients received no block. Visual
      analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess pain postoperatively. All patients
      received 1 g intravenous intravenous paracetamol 8th hourly and morphine was used
      as rescue analgesia if VAS score is more than 4. Patients were monitored for VAS 
      scores, postoperative nausea/ vomiting and total morphine consumption for a
      24-hour period in a high dependency unit. Results:: Postoperative morphine
      consumption was found to be significantly less in patients who received US-guided
      ESPB compared to control group (0.12 mg ± 0.59 mg in ESPB group compared to 1.70 
      ± 2.29 mg which was statistically significant, p=0.000). Only 3 patients in ESP
      group received rescue analgesia in the form of morphine whereas 22 patients in
      the control group received morphine. There was no difference in PONV score in
      either groups. There were no complications like vascular puncture, pneumothorax, 
      or respiratory depression in both groups. Conclusion:: US guided ESPB is quite
      effective in reducing perioperative pain in patients undergoing mastectomy. The
      trial was registered prospectively with CTRI with registration number:
      CTRI/2018/09/015668.

TI  - Adductor canal blockade versus continuous epidural analgesia after total knee
      joint replacement: A retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 38-43
AB  - Background:: Total knee arthroplasty is associated with intense pain
      postoperatively. Thus, adequate pain relief is essential in the immediate
      postoperative period to enable ambulation, initiation of physiotherapy, and
      prevention of postoperative complications. The objective of this study was to
      compare the effectiveness and early outcomes of adductor canal blockade (ACB) and
      continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) in patients who underwent a unilateral total 
      knee replacement (TKR). Materials and Methods:: This is a retrospective cohort
      study that was conducted in Riyadh with 80 patients receiving a unilateral total 
      knee arthroplasty from August 2017 to July 2018. Forty patients received ACB, and
      40 received CEA exclusively. The primary outcomes measured were the degree of
      knee flexion and extension in physiotherapy sessions on postoperative day 1 and
      discharge, how soon patients walked after surgery, length of hospital stay (LOS),
      local anesthetic and total opioid consumption, postoperative blood drainage
      output, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and pain scores. Results::
      Significantly more patients receiving ACB could flex their knee in the first 24 h
      postoperatively (P < 0.05), and the total drain output was also significantly
      less (P < 0.05). Pain in the first 8, 24, and 48 h was less in the ACB group
      using a Visual Analog Scale (P < 0.05). In addition, LOS, total opioid
      consumption, postoperative blood drain output, incidence of nausea and vomiting, 
      and pain scores were significantly decreased after using ACB compared with
      epidural analgesia. Conclusion:: This study provided evidence that ACB as
      postoperative analgesia after TKR is associated with better outcomes in terms of 
      facilitating early functional recovery and mobility, and consequently prevents
      major postoperative complications.

TI  - Repurposing Potential of Ketamine: Opportunities and Challenges.
PG  - 22-9
AB  - Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
      receptor which also interacts with various other receptors that account for its
      myriad actions. Originally approved as a general anesthetic, it is being explored
      to be repurposed for numerous other indications such as depressive disorders,
      suicidal ideation, substance-use disorders, anxiety disorders, chronic pain,
      refractory status epilepticus, and bronchial asthma exacerbations. Numerous
      trials are ongoing for the same. The nasal spray of esketamine, a more potent S
      (+) enantiomer of ketamine, has been approved by the United States Food and Drug 
      Administration (USFDA) for treatment-resistant depression along with the oral
      antidepressants. However, there are concerns about its safety on long term use,
      given its psychedelic effects and potential abuse. In this review, we discuss
      repurposing ketamine for potential therapeutic use and about the safety concerns 
      related to ketamine and esketamine.

TI  - Circadian disruption of core body temperature in trauma patients: a single-center
      retrospective observational study.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: Circadian clock alterations were poorly reported in trauma patients, 
      although they have a critical role in human physiology. Core body temperature is 
      a clinical variable regulated by the circadian clock. Our objective was to
      identify the circadian temperature disruption in trauma patients and to determine
      whether these disruptions were associated with the 28-day mortality rate.
      Methods: A retrospective and observational single-center cohort study was
      conducted. All adult severe trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit
      of Aix Marseille University, North Hospital, from November 2013 to February 2018,
      were evaluated. The variations of core body temperature for each patient were
      analyzed between days 2 and 3 after intensive care unit admission. Core body
      temperature variations were defined by three parameters: mesor, amplitude, and
      period. A logistic regression model was used to determine the variables
      influencing these three parameters. A survival analysis was performed assessing
      the association between core body temperature rhythm disruption and 28-day
      mortality rate. A post hoc subgroup analysis focused on the patients with head
      trauma. Results: Among the 1584 screened patients, 248 were included in this
      study. The period differed from 24 h in 177 (71%) patients. The mesor value (°C) 
      was associated with body mass index and ketamine use. Amplitude (°C) was
      associated with ketamine use only. The 28-day mortality rate was 18%. For all
      trauma patients, age, body mass index, intracranial hypertension, and amplitude
      were independent risk factors. The patients with a mesor value < 36.9 °C
      (p < 0.001) and an amplitude > 0.6 °C (p < 0.001) had a higher 28-day mortality
      rate. Among the patients with head trauma, mesor and amplitude were identified as
      independent risk factors (HR = 0.40, 95% CI [0.23–0.70], p = 0.001 and HR = 4.73,
      95% CI [1.38–16.22], p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our results highlight an association
      between core body temperature circadian alteration and 28-day mortality rate.
      This association was more pronounced in the head trauma patients than in the
      non-head trauma patients. Further studies are needed to show a causal link and
      consider possible interventions.

TI  - Patients with more comorbidities have better detection of chronic conditions, but
      poorer management and control: findings from six middle-income countries.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is rising rapidly in
      middle-income countries (MICs), where NCDs are often undiagnosed, untreated and
      uncontrolled. How comorbidity impacts diagnosis, treatment, and control of NCDs
      is an emerging area of research inquiry and have important clinical implications 
      as highlighted in the recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
      guidelines for treating patients suffering from multiple NCDs. This is the first 
      study to examine the association between increasing numbers of comorbidities with
      being undiagnosed, untreated, and uncontrolled for NCDs, in 6 large MICs.
      Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organisation Study of
      Global Ageing and Adult Health (WHO SAGE) Wave 1 (2007–10), which consisted of
      adults aged ≥18 years from 6 populous MICs, including China, Ghana, India,
      Mexico, Russia and South Africa (overall n = 41, 557). Results: A higher number
      of comorbidities was associated with better odds of diagnosis for hypertension,
      angina, and arthritis, and higher odds of having treatment for hypertension and
      angina. However, more comorbidities were associated with increased odds of
      uncontrolled hypertension, angina, arthritis, and asthma. Comorbidity with
      concordant conditions was associated with improved diagnosis and treatment of
      hypertension and angina. Conclusion: Patients with more comorbidities have better
      diagnosis of chronic conditions, but this does not translate into better
      management and control of these conditions. Patients with multiple NCDs are high 
      users of health services and are at an increased risk of adverse health outcomes.
      Hence, improving their access to care is a priority for healthcare systems.

TI  - Brainstem dysfunction in critically ill patients.
LID - 5
AB  - The brainstem conveys sensory and motor inputs between the spinal cord and the
      brain, and contains nuclei of the cranial nerves. It controls the sleep-wake
      cycle and vital functions via the ascending reticular activating system and the
      autonomic nuclei, respectively. Brainstem dysfunction may lead to sensory and
      motor deficits, cranial nerve palsies, impairment of consciousness, dysautonomia,
      and respiratory failure. The brainstem is prone to various primary and secondary 
      insults, resulting in acute or chronic dysfunction. Of particular importance for 
      characterizing brainstem dysfunction and identifying the underlying etiology are 
      a detailed clinical examination, MRI, neurophysiologic tests such as brainstem
      auditory evoked potentials, and an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid. Detection
      of brainstem dysfunction is challenging but of utmost importance in comatose and 
      deeply sedated patients both to guide therapy and to support outcome prediction. 
      In the present review, we summarize the neuroanatomy, clinical syndromes, and
      diagnostic techniques of critical illness-associated brainstem dysfunction for
      the critical care setting.

TI  - Pharmacological conditioning in the treatment of recent-onset rheumatoid
      arthritis: a randomized controlled trial study protocol.
LID - 15
AB  - Background: In pharmacological conditioning associations are formed between the
      effects of medication and contextual factors related to the medication.
      Pharmacological conditioning with placebo medication can result in comparable
      treatment effects and reduced side effects compared to regular treatment in
      various clinical populations, and may be applied to achieve enhanced drug
      effects. In the current study protocol, pharmacological conditioning is applied
      to achieve enhanced treatment effects in patients with recent-onset rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). The results from this study broaden the knowledge on the
      potential of pharmacological conditioning and provide a potential innovative
      treatment option to optimize long-term pharmacological treatment effectiveness
      for patients with inflammatory conditions, such as recent-onset RA. Methods: A
      multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial is conducted in patients with
      recent-onset RA. Participants start on standardized pharmacological treatment for
      16 weeks, which consists of methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg/week and a tapered schedule 
      of prednisone 60 mg or 30 mg. After 4 months, participants in clinical remission 
      (based on the rheumatologist’s opinion and a targeted score below 1.6 on a
      44-joint disease activity score (DAS44)) are randomized to 1 of 2 groups: (1) the
      control group (C), which continues with a standardized treatment schedule of MTX 
      15 mg/week or (2) the pharmacological conditioning group (PC), which receives an 
      MTX treatment schedule in alternating high and low dosages. In the case of
      persistent clinical remission after 8 months, treatment is tapered and
      discontinued linearly in the C group and variably in the PC group. Both groups
      receive the same cumulative amount of MTX during each period. Logistic regression
      analysis is used to compare the proportion of participants with drug-free
      clinical remission after 12 months between the C group and the PC group.
      Secondary outcome measures include clinical functioning, laboratory assessments, 
      and self-reported measures after each 4-month period up to 18 months after study 
      start. Discussion: The results from this study broaden the knowledge on the
      potential of pharmacological conditioning and provide a potential innovative
      treatment option to optimize long-term pharmacological treatment effectiveness in
      patients with inflammatory conditions, such as recent-onset RA. Trial

TI  - Preferences for methadone clinics among drug users in Vietnam: a comparison
      between public and private models.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been proven to be effective
      in treating opioid dependence. In Vietnam, MMT services are provided primarily by
      public clinics, with only one private MMT clinic established in recent years.
      Assessing the preferences of patients for different MMT models is important in
      evaluating the feasibility of these models. This study measured the preferences
      of drug users enrolling in public and private MMT clinics in Vietnam and examines
      the related factors of these preferences. Methods: A cross-sectional study was
      performed on 395 participants at 3 methadone clinics in Nam Dinh. Data about the 
      preferences for MMT models and sociodemographic characteristics of participants
      were collected. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to explore the construct
      validity of the questionnaire. The chi-square test and Mann-Whitney test were
      used for analyzing demographic characteristics and preferences of participants.
      Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with participants’
      preferences. Results: Half the participants received MMT treatment in a private
      facility (49.4%). Two preference dimensions were defined as “Availability and
      convenience of service” and “Competencies of clinic and health professionals”.
      Self-employed patients were more likely to consider these two dimensions when
      choosing MMT models. Only 9.9% of participants chose “Privacy” as one of the
      evaluation criteria for an MMT facility. Compared to public clinics, a
      statistically higher percentage of patients in the private clinic chose the
      attitudes of health workers as the reason for using MMT service (34.7% and 7.6%
      respectively). Mean score of satisfaction towards MMT services was 8.6 (SD =
      1.0), and this score was statistically higher in a public facility, compared to
      the private facility (8.7 and 8.4 respectively). Conclusions: The study
      highlighted patterns of patient preferences towards MMT clinics. Compared to the 
      public MMT model, the private MMT model may need to enhance their services to
      improve patient satisfaction.

TI  - A cluster randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      Implementation of Infant Pain Practice Change (ImPaC) Resource to improve pain
      practices in hospitalized infants: a study protocol.
LID - 16
AB  - Background: Hospitalized infants undergo multiple painful procedures daily.
      Despite the significant evidence, procedural pain assessment and management
      continues to be suboptimal. Repetitive and untreated pain at this vital
      developmental juncture is associated with negative behavioral and
      neurodevelopmental consequences. To address this knowledge to practice gap, we
      developed the web-based Implementation of Infant Pain Practice Change (ImPaC)
      Resource to guide change in healthcare professionals’ pain practice behaviors.
      This protocol describes the evaluation of the intervention effectiveness and
      implementation of the Resource and how organizational context influences
      outcomes. Methods: An effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 design, blending
      a cluster randomized clinical trial and a mixed-methods implementation study will
      be used. Eighteen Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) across Canada will be
      randomized to intervention (INT) or standard practice (SP) groups. NICUs in the
      INT group will receive the Resource for six months; those in the SP group will
      continue with practice as usual and will be offered the Resource after a
      six-month waiting period. Data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. To
      address the intervention effectiveness, the INT and SP groups will be compared on
      clinical outcomes including the proportion of infants who have procedural pain
      assessed and managed, and the frequency and nature of painful procedures. Data
      will be collected at baseline (before randomization) and at completion of the
      intervention (six months). Implementation outcomes (feasibility, fidelity,
      implementation cost, and reach) will be measured at completion of the
      intervention. Sustainability will be assessed at six and 12 months following the 
      intervention. Organizational context will be assessed to examine its influence on
      intervention and implementation outcomes. Discussion: This mixed-methods study
      aims to determine the effectiveness and the implementation of a multifaceted
      online strategy for changing healthcare professionals’ pain practices for
      hospitalized infants. Implementation strategies that are easily and effectively
      implemented are important for sustained change. The results will inform
      healthcare professionals and decision-makers on how to address the challenges of 
      implementing the Resource within various organizational contexts. Trial

TI  - A call for consensus in defining efficacy in clinical trials for opioid
      addiction: combined results from a systematic review and qualitative study in
      patients receiving pharmacological assisted therapy for opioid use disorder.
LID - 30
AB  - Background: Given the complex nature of opioid addiction treatment and the rising
      number of available opioid substitution and antagonist therapies (OSAT), there is
      no ‘gold standard’ measure of treatment effectiveness, and each successive trial 
      measures a different set of outcomes which reflect success in arbitrary or
      opportune terms. We sought to describe the variation in current outcomes employed
      across clinical trials for opioid addiction, as well as determine whether a
      discrepancy exists between the treatment targets that patients consider important
      and how treatment effectiveness is measured in the literature. Methods: We
      searched nine commonly used databases (e.g., EMBASE, MEDLINE) from inception to
      August 1, 2015. Outcomes used across trials were extracted and categorized
      according to previously established domains. To evaluate patient-reported goals
      of treatment, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 adults undergoing
      methadone treatment. Results: We identified 60 trials eligible for inclusion.
      Once outcomes were categorized into eight broad domains (e.g.,
      abstinence/substance abuse), we identified 21 specific outcomes with furthermore 
      53 subdomains and 118 measurements. Continued opioid use and treatment retention 
      were the most commonly reported measures (46%, n = 28). The majority of patients 
      agreed that abstinence from opioids was a primary goal in their treatment,
      although they also stressed goals under-reported in clinical trials. Conclusions:
      There is inconsistency in the measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of
      OSATs. Individual and population level decision making is being guided by a
      standard of effect considered useful to researchers yet in direct conflict with
      what patients deem important. Trial registration: PROSPERO, CRD42013006507.

TI  - Potential of animal models for advancing the understanding and treatment of pain 
      in Parkinson’s disease.
LID - 1
AB  - Pain is a commonly occurring non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD).
      Treatment of pain in PD remains less than optimal and a better understanding of
      the underlying mechanisms would facilitate discovery of improved analgesics.
      Animal models of PD have already proven helpful for furthering the understanding 
      and treatment of motor symptoms of PD, but could these models offer insight into 
      pain in PD? This review addresses the current position regarding pain in
      preclinical models of PD, covering the face and predictive validity of existing
      models and their use so far in advancing understanding of the mechanisms
      contributing to pain in PD. While pain itself is not usually measured in animals,
      nociception in the form of thermal, mechanical or chemical nociceptive thresholds
      offers a useful readout, given reduced nociceptive thresholds are commonly seen
      in PD patients. Animal models of PD including the reserpine-treated rat and
      neurodegenerative models such as the MPTP-treated mouse and 6-hydroxydopamine
      (6-OHDA)-treated rat each exhibit reduced nociceptive thresholds, supporting face
      validity of these models. Furthermore, some interventions known clinically to
      relieve pain in PD, such as dopaminergic therapies and deep brain stimulation of 
      the subthalamic nucleus, restore nociceptive thresholds in one or more models,
      supporting their predictive validity. Mechanistic insight gained already includes
      involvement of central and spinal dopamine and opioid systems. Moving forward,
      these preclinical models should advance understanding of the cellular and
      molecular mechanisms underlying pain in PD and provide test beds for examining
      the efficacy of novel analgesics to better treat this debilitating non-motor
      symptom.

TI  - Adverse drug reactions in primary care: a scoping review.
LID - 5
AB  - Background: Medication-related adverse events, or adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
      are harmful events caused by medication. ADRs could have profound effects on the 
      patients’ quality of life, as well as creating an increased burden on the
      healthcare system. ADRs are one of the rising causes of morbidity and mortality
      internationally, and will continue to be a significant public health issue with
      the increased complexity in medication, to treat various diseases in an aging
      society. This scoping review aims to provide a detailed map of the most common
      adverse drug reactions experienced in primary healthcare setting, the drug
      classes that are most commonly associated with different levels/types of adverse 
      drug reactions, causes of ADRs, their prevalence and consequences of experiencing
      ADRs. Methods: We systematically reviewed electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE,
      Embase, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and
      Scopus. In addition, the National Patient Safety Foundation Bibliography and the 
      Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and Patient Safety Net Bibliography
      were searched. Studies published from 1990 onwards until December 7, 2018 were
      included as the incidence of reporting drug reactions were not prevalent before
      1990. We only include studies published in English. Results: The final search
      yielded a total of 19 citations for inclusion published over a 15-year period
      that primarily focused on investigating the different types of adverse drug
      reactions in primary healthcare. The most causes of adverse events were related
      to drug related and allergies. Idiosyncratic adverse reactions were not very
      commonly reported. The most common adverse drug reactions reported in the studies
      included in this review were those that are associated with the central nervous
      system, gastrointestinal system and cardiovascular system. Several classes of
      medications were reported to be associated with adverse events. Conclusion: This 
      scoping review identified that the most causes of ADRs were drug related and due 
      to allergies. Idiosyncratic adverse reactions were not very commonly reported in 
      the literature. This is mainly because it is hard to predict and these reactions 
      are not associated with drug doses or routes of administration. The most common
      ADRs reported in the studies included in this review were those that are
      associated with the central nervous system, gastrointestinal system and
      cardiovascular system. Several classes of medications were reported to be
      associated with ADRs.

TI  - A cross sectional study to determine the prevalence of cough and its impact in
      patients with lung cancer: a patient unmet need.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: There is absence of literature related to cough prevalence and its
      characteristics in lung cancer patients, with information deriving only from
      broader symptoms occurrence studies. The aims of this study were to provide a
      snapshot of the prevalence of all-cause-cough in lung cancer patients and to
      characterise cough in terms of its impact and severity. Methods: A
      cross-sectional study recruiting consecutive lung cancer patients over a
      pre-defined period of time and using cough-specific validated tools in a tertiary
      referral centre in the UK, including a cough severity VAS and the Manchester
      Cough in Lung Cancer scale (MCLCS). Results: Data was collected from 202
      patients. All-cause cough prevalence was 57% (through VAS) both in the screened
      (N = 223) and research (N = 202) population or 67% (through the MCLCS), and cough
      severity was moderate at a mean of 32 mm (in a 100 mm VAS). Age, sex, smoking
      status, lung cancer histology, stage and comorbidities were not associated with
      cough prevalence. The only variable associated with lower cough reports was being
      ‘on anticancer treatment’; fewer patients on treatment reported a cough (40%)
      compared to those off treatment (54%) (p = 0.04). The impact of cough (as
      measured by MCLCS) was also significant (mean score = 22). About 18% of patients 
      felt moderate/severe distress from their cough and about 15% often or always
      reported disturbed sleep due to coughing. Half the patients felt their cough
      warranted treatment. Conclusions: Cough is a common symptom in lung cancer with
      considerable impact on patients’ lives. Cough presence and severity should
      regularly be assessed in clinical practice. There is an urgent need to focus on
      developing more potent antitussive treatments and improve the management of this 
      complex and distressing symptom.

AB  - Background: Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive imaging modality designed to
      evaluate various small bowel pathologies. Failure to reach the cecum within the
      battery lifespan, termed incomplete examination, may result in inadequate testing
      and possibly delayed therapy. Several studies have attempted to evaluate the
      association between CE completion and opioid use. However, their results are
      conflicting. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the previously
      published literature on the association between opioid use and CE completion.
      Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, PubMed
      Central, Embase, and ScienceDirect databases from inception through June 1, 2018,
      to identify all studies that evaluated the association between CE completion and 
      opioid use. We included studies that presented an odds ratio (OR) with a 95%
      confidence interval (CI) or presented the data sufficient to calculate the OR
      with a 95% CI. Statistical analysis was performed using the comprehensive
      meta-analysis (CMA), version 3 software. Results: Five studies with a total of
      1,614 patients undergoing CE in the inpatient (IP) and outpatient (OP) setting
      were included in this study, 349 of which had an incomplete CE (21.6%). The
      pooled OR for CE completion is 0.50 (95% CI: 0.38–0.66, I2=36.9%) in opioid users
      compared to non-users. No publication bias was found using Egger’s regression
      test. Conclusions: Our results indicate that patients on opioids are
      significantly less likely to have a complete CE examination compared to
      non-users. To our knowledge, this study represents the first meta-analysis to
      assess this association.

TI  - Botulinum Neurotoxins and Cancer—A Review of the Literature.
LID - 32
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) possess an analgesic effect through several
      mechanisms including an inhibition of acetylcholine release from the
      neuromuscular junction as well as an inhibition of specific pain transmitters and
      mediators. Animal studies have shown that a peripheral injection of BoNTs impairs
      the release of major pain transmitters such as substance P, calcitonin gene
      related peptide (CGRP) and glutamate from peripheral nerve endings as well as
      peripheral and central neurons (dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord). These
      effects lead to pain relief via the reduction of peripheral and central
      sensitization both of which reflect important mechanisms of pain chronicity. This
      review provides updated information about the effect of botulinum toxin injection
      on local pain caused by cancer, painful muscle spasms from a remote cancer, and
      pain at the site of cancer surgery and radiation. The data from the literature
      suggests that the local injection of BoNTs improves muscle spasms caused by
      cancerous mass lesions and alleviates the post-operative neuropathic pain at the 
      site of surgery and radiation. It also helps repair the parotid damage (fistula, 
      sialocele) caused by facial surgery and radiation and improves post-parotidectomy
      gustatory hyperhidrosis. The limited literature that suggests adding botulinum
      toxins to cell culture slows/halts the growth of certain cancer cells is also
      reviewed and discussed.

TI  - Multidisciplinary Pain Management of Chronic Back Pain: Helpful Treatments from
      the Patients’ Perspective.
LID - 145
AB  - Multidisciplinary pain management programs (MPMP) for patients suffering from
      chronic back pain include a variety of treatment modalities. The patients’
      perceived helpfulness of these treatment modalities remains unclear. The aims of 
      this prospective observational cohort study were to assess (i) the patients’
      perceived helpfulness of different treatment modalities, (ii) the influence of
      sociodemographic characteristics on the patient’s perspective and (iii) whether
      treatment outcomes are affected by helpfulness ratings. Treatment modalities of
      this three-week MPMP consisted of individual physiotherapy, group-based
      physiotherapy, relaxation therapy, aquatic therapy, back education, medical
      training therapy, biofeedback, psychological pain therapy and music therapy. The 
      study comprised 395 patients. The main outcome was the patients’ perceived
      treatment helpfulness at the end of the program measured by a self-reported
      questionnaire ranging from 1 (not at all helpful) to 6 (extremely helpful).
      Secondary outcomes were treatment effects on pain, pain related disability,
      functional ability and level of depressive symptoms measured by self-reported
      questionnaires (NRS, PDI, FFbH-R, ADS-L). A total of 276 patients (22–64 years,
      57% female) were available for overall analysis.
      Multivariate-analysis-of-variance- (MANOVA-) related results revealed that
      perceived treatment helpfulness (range 1–6) differed significantly between
      treatment modalities: individual physiotherapy (M = 5.00), group-based
      physiotherapy (M = 4.87), relaxation therapy (M = 4.6), aquatic therapy (M =
      4.54), back education (M = 4.43), medical training therapy (M = 3.38),
      biofeedback (M = 3.31), psychological pain therapy (M = 3.15), music therapy (M =
      3.02). Pain, pain related disability and levels of depressive symptoms
      significantly improved after the program (p < 0.001) whereas functional ability
      decreased (p < 0.01). Significant correlations were found between helpfulness
      ratings and sociodemographic data indicating that perceived treatment helpfulness
      was influenced by patient-related factors. Importantly, the degree of
      pain-related improvements was affected by the patients’ perceived treatment
      helpfulness. In conclusion, patients’ perceived treatment helpfulness differs
      significantly between treatment modalities and corresponds to treatment outcome.

TI  - Mu Opioid Receptor 1 (MOR-1) Expression in Colorectal Cancer and Oncological
      Long-Term Outcomes: A Five-Year Retrospective Longitudinal Cohort Study.
LID - 134
AB  - Preclinical evidence has shown increased expression of mu opioid receptor 1
      (MOR-1) in colorectal cancer although its association with disease-free and
      overall survival (DFS and OS) has not been investigated. We hypothesized that
      MOR-1 was overexpressed in tumor samples compared to normal tissue and this was
      associated with decreased DFS and OS. We carried out a retrospective study
      assessing the association of MOR-1 tumor expression with long-term outcomes by
      immunohistochemistry in normal and tumor samples from 174 colorectal cancer
      patients. The primary endpoint was five years of DFS. Secondary endpoints were
      five years of OS, the difference in MOR-1 expression between normal and tumor
      tissue and the occurrence of postoperative complications. Multivariable Cox
      regression showed no significant association between MOR-1 expression and DFS (HR
      0.791, 95% CI 0.603–1.039, p = 0.092). MOR-1 expression was higher in tumor
      tissue compared to non-tumor tissue. No associations were found between MOR-1
      expression and OS or postoperative complications. These findings suggest that
      although MOR-1 is over-expressed in colorectal cancer samples there is no
      association to increased risk of recurrence or mortality. Future studies are
      warranted to elucidate the role of cancer stage, genetic polymorphism, and
      quantitative assessment of MOR-1 over-expression on long-term outcomes in
      colorectal cancer.

TI  - The association between genome‐wide polymorphisms and chronic postoperative pain:
      a prospective observational study.
PG  - e111-20
AB  - Chronic postoperative pain is common and can have a negative impact on quality of
      life. Recent studies show that genetic risk factors are likely to play a role,
      although only gene‐targeted analysis has been used to date. This is the first
      genome‐wide association study to identify single‐nucleotide polymorphisms
      associated with the development of chronic postoperative pain based on two
      independent cohorts. In a discovery cohort, 330 women scheduled for hysterectomy 
      were genotyped. A case–control association analysis compared patients without
      chronic postoperative pain and the 34 who had severe chronic postoperative pain
      3 months after surgery. No single‐nucleotide polymorphisms reached genome‐wide
      significance, but several showed suggestive associations with chronic
      postoperative pain (p < 1 × 10−5). Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms with
      significance p < 1 × 10−5 were followed up in a replication cohort consisting of 
      203 men and women scheduled for orthopaedic or abdominal surgery. Ten of these
      patients developed severe chronic postoperative pain. A single‐nucleotide
      polymorphism in NAV3 was significantly replicated with chronic postoperative pain
      in the replication cohort (p = 0.009). Meta‐analysis revealed that two loci
      (IQGAP1 and CRTC3) were significantly associated with chronic postoperative pain 
      at 3 months (IQGAP1 p = 3.93 × 10−6 β = 2.3863, CRTC3 p = 2.26 × 10−6,
      β = 2.4209). The present genome‐wide association study provides initial evidence 
      for genetic risk factors of chronic postoperative pain and supports follow‐up
      studies.

TI  - Multifactorial Scores and Biomarkers of Prognosis of Acute Pancreatitis:
      Applications to Research and Practice.
LID - 338
AB  - Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe inflammation of the pancreas presented with
      sudden onset and severe abdominal pain with a high morbidity and mortality rate, 
      if accompanied by severe local and systemic complications. Numerous studies have 
      been published about the pathogenesis of AP; however, the precise mechanism
      behind this pathology remains unclear. Extensive research conducted over the last
      decades has demonstrated that the first 24 h after symptom onset are critical for
      the identification of patients who are at risk of developing complications or
      death. The identification of these subgroups of patients is crucial in order to
      start an aggressive approach to prevent mortality. In this sense and to avoid
      unnecessary overtreatment, thereby reducing the financial implications, the
      proper identification of mild disease is also important and necessary. A large
      number of multifactorial scoring systems and biochemical markers are described to
      predict the severity. Despite recent progress in understanding the
      pathophysiology of AP, more research is needed to enable a faster and more
      accurate prediction of severe AP. This review provides an overview of the
      available multifactorial scoring systems and biochemical markers for predicting
      severe AP with a special focus on their advantages and limitations.

      answer to the optimal choice between the two techniques. Our study aims to
      investigate analgesic efficacy and safety of PAI versus IAI in patients receiving
      simultaneous bilateral TKA. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was
      conducted from February 2017 and finished in July 2018. Sixty patients eligible
      for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to
      receive PAI on one side and IAI on another. Primary outcomes included numerical
      rating scale (NRS) pain score at rest or during activity at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h,
      48 h, and 72 h following surgery. Secondary outcomes contained active or passive 
      range of motion (ROM) at 1, 2, and 3 days after surgery, time to perform straight
      leg raise, wound drainage, operation time, and wound complications. Results:
      Patients experienced lower NRS pain scores of the knee receiving PAI compared
      with that with PAI during the first 48 h after surgery. The largest difference of
      NRS pain score at rest occurred at 48 h (PAI: 0.68, 95%CI[0.37, 0.98]; IAI: 2.63,
      95%CI [2.16, 3.09]; P < 0.001); and the largest difference of NRS pain score
      during activity also took place at 48 h (PAI: 2.46, 95%CI [2.07, 2.85]; IAI:
      3.90, 95%CI [3.27, 4.52]; P = 0.001). PAI group had better results of range of
      motion and time to perform straight leg raise when compared with IAI group. There
      were no differences in operation time, wound drainage, and wound complication.
      Conclusion: PAI had the superior performance of pain relief and improvement of
      range of motion to IAI. Therefore, the administration technique of peri-articular
      injection is recommended when performing local infiltration analgesia after total
      knee arthroplasty. Trial registration: The trial was retrospectively registered
      in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry as ChiCTR1800020420 on 29th December,
      2018. Level of evidence: Therapeutic Level I.

TI  - Impact of EMA regulatory label changes on systemic diclofenac initiation,
      discontinuation, and switching to other pain medicines in Scotland, England,
      Denmark, and The Netherlands.
PG  - 296-305
AB  - Purpose: In June 2013 a European Medicines Agency referral procedure concluded
      that diclofenac was associated with an elevated risk of acute cardiovascular
      events and contraindications, warnings, and changes to the product information
      were implemented across the European Union. This study measured the impact of the
      regulatory action on the prescribing of systemic diclofenac in Denmark, The
      Netherlands, England, and Scotland. Methods: Quarterly time series analyses
      measuring diclofenac prescription initiation, discontinuation and switching to
      other systemic nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAIDs), topical NSAIDs,
      paracetamol, opioids, and other chronic pain medication in those who discontinued
      diclofenac. Absolute effects were estimated using interrupted time series
      regression. Results: Overall, diclofenac prescription initiations fell during the
      observation periods of all countries. Compared with Denmark where there appeared 
      to be a more limited effect, the regulatory action was associated with
      significant immediate reductions in diclofenac initiation in The Netherlands
      (−0.42%, 95% CI, −0.66% to −0.18%), England (−0.09%, 95% CI, −0.11% to −0.08%),
      and Scotland (−0.67%, 95% CI, −0.79% to −0.55%); and falling trends in diclofenac
      initiation in the Netherlands (−0.03%, 95% CI, −0.06% to −0.01% per quarter) and 
      Scotland (−0.04%, 95% CI, −0.05% to −0.02% per quarter). There was no significant
      impact on diclofenac discontinuation in any country. The regulatory action was
      associated with modest differences in switching to other pain medicines following
      diclofenac discontinuation. Conclusions: The regulatory action was associated
      with significant reductions in overall diclofenac initiation which varied by
      country and type of exposure. There was no impact on discontinuation and variable
      impact on switching.

TI  - Adenotonsillectomy and postoperative respiratory adverse events: A retrospective 
      study.
PG  - 168-74
AB  - Objectives: Postoperative respiratory adverse events (PRAEs) are known
      complications following adenotonsillectomy (AT). Clinical data at a single
      institution were reviewed to investigate the factors that may contribute to PRAEs
      in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). The relationship between PRAEs in the
      PACU and escalation of care, defined as either an unplanned admission for
      outpatient surgery or unplanned pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission,
      was investigated. Methods: The perioperative records for all patients who
      underwent AT from 2016 to 2018 were reviewed. The surgical procedure was
      performed at both the main campus and the ambulatory surgery center in accordance
      with the institutional obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) guidelines. Patient
      characteristics and intraoperative medications were compared. Categorical
      variables were summarized as counts with percentages and compared using
      chi‐square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Continuous variables were summarized as
      medians with interquartile ranges and compared using rank‐sum tests.
      Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of
      intraoperative dosing with the occurrence of PRAEs. Results: The study cohort
      included 6110 patients. Ninety‐three patients (2%) experienced PRAEs in the PACU.
      Of these 93 patients, 14 (15%) resulted in an escalation of care, nearly all of
      which were unplanned PICU admissions. PRAEs tended to occur in younger patients, 
      non‐Hispanic black patients, and those with a higher American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) status. Conclusions: PRAEs are infrequent after AT at a
      tertiary institution with OSA guidelines in place. However, when PRAEs do occur, 
      escalation of care may be required. Risk factors include age, ethnic background, 
      and ASA physical status. Level of Evidence: III.

TI  - Controversial Topics in Total Knee Arthroplasty: A 5-Year Update (Part 1).
LID - e19.00047
AB  - This review article examines updates to the literature during the past 5 years on
      numerous topics related to total knee arthroplasty which were felt to have
      ongoing controversy. These include the use of peripheral nerve blocks and local
      infiltrative analgesia, intrathecal morphine, patellar resurfacing, and bearing
      designs.Methods:: For each individual topic, a literature search was conducted on
      several databases with emphasis on studies that were published in the past 5
      years. Preference was given to meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials.
      Results:: Multimodal periarticular injections may provide an equally effective
      analgesic effect to peripheral nerve blocks, but are also muscle sparing and less
      invasive. The use of intrathecal morphine in addition to periarticular injections
      is less desirable given the potential side effects, associated cost, and lack of 
      clear benefit intrathecal morphine beyond the 6- to 12-hour postoperative period.
      Patellar resurfacing was associated with a lower rate of revision surgery,
      similar or potentially improved satisfaction and functional outcomes, and no
      increased risk of complications compared with nonresurfacing. There are no clear 
      or notable differences between cruciate-retaining and posterior-stabilized total 
      knee designs in terms of clinical outcomes and survivorship. Medial pivot designs
      theoretically recreate more normal knee kinematics compared with
      cruciate-retaining or posterior-stabilized designs, although superiority has not 
      yet been clearly demonstrated and additional long-term data is necessary,
      particularly for survivorship. Conclusions:: By analyzing the results of the
      aforementioned studies, surgeons can implement the most up-to-date evidence-based
      care when doing total knee arthroplasty surgery. However, many of these selected 
      topics continue to have a component of ongoing controversy with no definitive
      conclusions developed in recent literature.

TI  - The Detection of Opioid Misuse and Heroin Use From Paramedic Response
      Documentation: Machine Learning for Improved Surveillance.
LID - e15645
AB  - Background: Timely, precise, and localized surveillance of nonfatal events is
      needed to improve response and prevention of opioid-related problems in an
      evolving opioid crisis in the United States. Records of naloxone administration
      found in prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) data have helped estimate
      opioid overdose incidence, including nonhospital, field-treated cases. However,
      as naloxone is often used by EMS personnel in unconsciousness of unknown cause,
      attributing naloxone administration to opioid misuse and heroin use (OM) may
      misclassify events. Better methods are needed to identify OM. Objective: This
      study aimed to develop and test a natural language processing method that would
      improve identification of potential OM from paramedic documentation. Methods:
      First, we searched Denver Health paramedic trip reports from August 2017 to April
      2018 for keywords naloxone, heroin, and both combined, and we reviewed narratives
      of identified reports to determine whether they constituted true cases of OM.
      Then, we used this human classification as reference standard and trained 4
      machine learning models (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector
      machines, and L1-regularized logistic regression). We selected the algorithm that
      produced the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for model
      assessment. Finally, we compared positive predictive value (PPV) of the highest
      performing machine learning algorithm with PPV of searches of keywords naloxone, 
      heroin, and combination of both in the binary classification of OM in unseen
      September 2018 data. Results: In total, 54,359 trip reports were filed from
      August 2017 to April 2018. Approximately 1.09% (594/54,359) indicated naloxone
      administration. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement regarding OM in the
      narrative, 57.6% (292/516) were considered to include information revealing OM.
      Approximately 1.63% (884/54,359) of all trip reports mentioned heroin in the
      narrative. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 95.5% (784/821) were
      considered to include information revealing OM. Combined results accounted for
      2.39% (1298/54,359) of trip reports. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 
      77.79% (907/1166) were considered to include information consistent with OM. The 
      reference standard used to train and test machine learning models included
      details of 1166 trip reports. L1-regularized logistic regression was the highest 
      performing algorithm (AUC=0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.97) in identifying OM. Tested on
      5983 unseen reports from September 2018, the keyword naloxone inaccurately
      identified and underestimated probable OM trip report cases (63 cases; PPV=0.68).
      The keyword heroin yielded more cases with improved performance (129 cases;
      PPV=0.99). Combined keyword and L1-regularized logistic regression classifier
      further improved performance (146 cases; PPV=0.99). Conclusions: A machine
      learning application enhanced the effectiveness of finding OM among documented
      paramedic field responses. This approach to refining OM surveillance may lead to 
      improved first-responder and public health responses toward prevention of
      overdoses and other opioid-related problems in US communities.

TI  - Sexual dysfunction in men on buprenorphine – naloxone-based substitution therapy.
PG  - 66-72
AB  - Background:: The literature on sexual dysfunction in patients on
      buprenorphine-naloxone (BNX) substitution is limited. Materials and Methods::
      This research aimed to study the prevalence and correlates of sexual dysfunction 
      in men on BNX substitution therapy. We recruited consecutive forty men from BNX
      clinic, who had received BNX for at least 6 months, who were free from any recent
      illicit drug use (confirmed by urine chromatographic immune assay), and who were 
      either married or had a stable sexual partner. Men with other psychiatric and
      substance use disorders (except tobacco) were excluded from the study. Data for
      the control group were obtained from a published study (with similar selection
      criteria) from our center. We assessed sexual dysfunction with two
      cross-culturally validated instruments: Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX)
      and International Index of Erectile Function. Results:: The sample had a mean age
      of 31.6 (±8) years; the mean duration of BNX treatment was 9 (±4.2) months and
      the mean BNX dose was 4.5 (±1.6) mg. ASEX showed the prevalence of sexual
      dysfunction to be 40%. The IIEF demonstrated intercourse dissatisfaction (95%)
      and hypoactive sexual desire (92.5%) as almost universal, while 77.5% of the
      participants reported erectile dysfunction. In comparison to the published data, 
      these figures were significantly more than among the controls. We found no
      correlation of sexual dysfunction with marital status, age, duration or dose of
      BNX, duration of illicit opioid use, the severity of opioid dependence, and
      tobacco dependence. Conclusion:: All men on BNX maintenance therapy must be
      screened for sexual dysfunction. With the rapid scaling up of office-based BNX
      substitution, assessment and management of sexual dysfunction ought to be
      incorporated in the training curriculum.

TI  - Pain relieving effect of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing total knee or hip
      arthroplasty: A meta-analysis.
LID - e18538
AB  - Background: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine in patients
      undergoing total knee and hip arthroplasty for postoperative pain control.
      Methods: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) identified in systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google
      Scholar, the Cochrane Database and the Chinese SinoMed Database. Results:
      Fourteen RCTs with a total of 1220 patients were included. Overall,
      dexmedetomidine therapy was associated with significantly decreased pain scores
      24 hours after surgery (WMD, −0.36; 95% CI, −0.49 to −0.22; I2 = 90.0%, P < .001)
      compared with scores in the control group after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and 
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Furthermore, the rate of postoperative delirium
      was also markedly decreased with dexmedetomidine therapy (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 
      to 0.59; I2 = 0.0%, P < .001). Moreover, compared with the control group,
      dexmedetomidine treatment was associated with a decreased risk of postoperative
      nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing TKA (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.79;
      I2 = 0.0%, P = .012), and there was a similar risk of hypotension (RR, 1.03; 95% 
      CI, 0.72 to 1.49; I2 = 24.4%, P = .87) regardless of whether patients underwent
      TKA or THA. However, the rate of bradycardia was significantly increased with
      dexmedetomidine treatment in those undergoing TKA (RR, 6.11; 95% CI, 2.35 to
      15.91; I2 = 0.0%, P < .001). Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine therapy seems to be an 
      effective treatment for pain control and postoperative delirium in patients
      undergoing TKA/THA. However, the incidence of bradycardia is markedly increased
      in patients undergoing TKA. Hence, much larger prospective clinical studies are
      warranted to confirm these findings.

      review and meta-analysis.
LID - e18629
AB  - Objectives:: To compare the effectiveness and safety of epidural anesthesia (EA) 
      with those of local anesthesia (LA) for percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic
      discectomy (PTED) and provide reference data for clinical decision-making.
      Methods:: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, Web of Science,
      Medline, ScienceDirect, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure from
      inception to June 2019 in order to identify randomized and nonrandomized
      controlled trials comparing EA and LA for PTED. Studies assessing at least 2 of
      the following indicators were eligible: surgical duration, X-ray exposure time,
      satisfaction rate, visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, Oswestry Disability
      Index (ODI), and complications. Two assessors evaluated the quality of the
      literature using the Cochrane Handbook or Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis
      was conducted using Review Manager 5.3.3 software. Results:: Four randomized
      controlled trials and 4 retrospective cohort studies involving a total of 1000
      patients were included. The LA and EA groups included 473 and 527 patients,
      respectively. Meta-analysis revealed significant intergroup differences in the
      intraoperative (P < .00001) and postoperative (P < .00001) lumbar VAS scores,
      intraoperative (P < .00001) and postoperative (P = .001) leg VAS scores, and
      anesthesia satisfaction rate (P < .00001), with EA being superior to LA in all
      aspects. There were no significant intergroup differences in the surgical
      duration, X-ray exposure time, postoperative ODI, and complication rate.
      Conclusion:: EA is as safe as LA and produces better anesthetic effects than does
      LA in patients undergoing PTED. Therefore, it should be promoted as a reliable
      anesthetic technique for PTED.

TI  - Optimal effect-site concentration of propofol for tracheal suctioning during
      emergence from ophthalmic surgery.
LID - e18669
AB  - In ophthalmic surgery, coughing during emergence from general anesthesia may have
      a detrimental effect on intraocular pressure. Tracheal suction during emergence
      may elicit this reflex. The optimal effect-site concentration (EC) of propofol to
      prevent triggering of the cough reflex during tracheal suctioning is unknown. The
      aim of this study is to assess the optimal EC of propofol for tracheal suctioning
      during emergence in patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery.Twenty-one patients
      were enrolled, all of them American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical
      status I or II non-smokers undergoing ophthalmic surgery. Anesthesia was induced 
      and maintained under total intravenous anesthesia using target-controlled
      infusion. During emergence from general anesthesia, tracheal suction was
      performed at different propofol concentrations as required for Dixon's
      up-and-down method with a step size of 0.2 μg/ml. A propofol concentration at
      which the cough reflex was not triggered during tracheal suctioning was
      considered successful.The EC50 of propofol for tracheal suction without cough was
      1.4 μg/ml and the EC95 was 1.6 μg/ml.Tracheal suction may be accomplished without
      triggering the cough reflex when the propofol effect-site concentration is higher
      than 1.6 μg/ml.

TI  - Comparison of median effective concentration of ropivacaine in multiparas or
      primiparas during epidural labor analgesia: STROBE compliant.
LID - e18673
AB  - The documents on the median effective concentration of local analgesic were many 
      in primiparas during labor analgesia. However, the studies were fewer in
      multiparas. To explore the analgesic requirements in multiparas during epidural
      labor analgesia, we investigated the median effective concentration of
      ropivacaine with 2 μg/mL fentanyl for epidural labor analgesia in
      multiparas.Sixty-two women were recruited and assigned to the primipara group and
      multipara group in this prospective study. All the parturients received
      ropivacaine combined with 2 μg/mL fentanyl for epidural labor analgesia. The
      concentration of ropivacaine was determined by the up and down method and an
      initial concentration was set as 0.1% with a 0.01% interval. Effective analgesia 
      was defined as the visual analog scale (VAS) ≤3 within 30 minutes after epidural 
      administration when cervical dilatation is about 2 cm. The median effective
      concentration of ropivacaine was calculated by the up and down sequential method.
      The pain intensity was assessed using VAS. Hemodynamic parameters, the labor
      stages, and neonatal Apgar scores were recorded. Umbilical artery blood was drawn
      to analyze. The side effects, if any, were also recorded.The median effective
      concentration of ropivacaine was 0.057% (95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.051–0.064%) in primiparas during epidural labor analgesia, and 0.068% (95% CI, 
      0.063–0.072%) in multiparas during epidural labor analgesia, there was
      significant difference between the groups (P = .02).This study indicated that the
      median effective concentration of ropivacaine with fentanyl for epidural labor
      analgesia was 0.068% (95% CI, 0.063–0.072%) and increased in multiparas compared 
      with the primiparas (www.chictr.org.cn, registration number: ChiCTR-1800016486)

      treatment patterns for the treatment of depression. Methods: Patients with
      depression were identified from four large national claims databases during
      1/1/2014–1/31/2019. Patients had ≥2 diagnoses for depression or an inpatient
      hospitalization with a diagnosis of depression. Patients were required to have
      enrollment in the database ≥1 year prior to and 3 years following their first
      depression diagnosis. Treatment patterns were captured at the class level and
      included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, other
      antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics/sedatives, and antipsychotics. Treatment 
      patterns were captured during all available follow-up. Results: We identified
      269,668 patients diagnosed with depression. The proportion not receiving any
      pharmacological treatment during follow-up ranged from 29 to 52%. Of the treated,
      approximately half received ≥2 different classes of therapy, a quarter received
      ≥3 classes and more than 10% received 4 or more. SSRIs were the most common
      first-line treatment; however, many patients received an anxiolytic,
      hypnotic/sedative, or antipsychotic prior to any antidepressive treatment.
      Treatment with a combination of classes ranged from approximately 20% of
      first-line therapies to 40% of fourth-line. Conclusions: Many patients diagnosed 
      with depression go untreated and many others receive a non-antidepressant
      medication class as their first treatment. More than half of patients received
      more than one type of treatment class during the study follow up, suggesting that
      the first treatment received may not be optimal for most patients.

TI  - Malfunctioning sufentanil intrathecal pain pump: a case report.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: Sufentanil is a potent opioid uncommonly used to manage pain and is
      rarely administered via an intrathecal pain pump system. Case presentation: This 
      case illustrates the use of intrathecal sufentanil in a 50-year-old Caucasian man
      for the management of chronic pain; however, the intrathecal drug delivery system
      experienced a malfunction which led to 1/100th output of the correct dosage.
      Interesting aspects of this case report include the uncommon choice of sufentanil
      use for an intrathecal drug delivery system, as well as the unusual
      pharmacokinetics of this drug. Specifically, this patient did not experience the 
      major withdrawal that would be expected given significant under dosing of opioid,
      and this may be explained by the lipophilicity and context-sensitive half-times
      of sufentanil. Conclusions: Because of the absence of a clinically significant
      withdrawal in this case report, clinicians must be aware of relevant
      pharmacokinetic properties and unusual intrathecal drug delivery system
      technologies that influence a patient’s response when device malfunction occurs.

TI  - The application of enhanced recovery after surgery for upper gastrointestinal
      surgery: Meta-analysis.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: Although enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has made great
      progress in the field of surgery, the guidelines point to the lack of
      high-quality evidence in upper gastrointestinal surgery. Methods: Randomized
      controlled trials in four electronic databases that involved ERAS protocols for
      upper gastrointestinal surgery were searched through December 12, 2018. The
      primary endpoints were lung infection, urinary tract infection, surgical site
      infection, postoperative anastomotic leakage and ileus. The secondary endpoints
      were postoperative length of stay, the time from end of surgery to first flatus
      and defecation, and readmission rates. Subgroup analysis was performed based on
      the type of surgery. Results: A total of 17 studies were included. The results of
      the meta-analysis indicate that there was a decrease in rates of lung infection
      (RR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.33 to 0.75), postoperative length of stay (MD = -2.53,
      95%CI: − 3.42 to − 1.65), time until first postoperative flatus (MD = -0.64,
      95%CI: − 0.84 to − 0.45) and time until first postoperative defecation
      (MD = -1.10, 95%CI: − 1.74 to − 0.47) in patients who received ERAS, compared to 
      conventional care. However, other outcomes were not significant difference. There
      was no significant difference between ERAS and conventional care in rates of
      urinary tract infection (P = 0.10), surgical site infection (P = 0.42),
      postoperative anastomotic leakage (P = 0.45), readmissions (P = 0.31) and ileus
      (P = 0.25). Conclusions: ERAS protocols can reduce the risk of postoperative lung
      infection and accelerating patient recovery time. Nevertheless, we should also
      consider further research ERAS should be performed undergoing gastrectomy and
      esophagectomy.

TI  - Oxygen use and survival in patients with advanced cancer and low oxygen
      saturation in home care: a preliminary retrospective cohort study.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: The role of oxygen therapy in end-of-life care for patients with
      advanced cancer is incompletely understood. We aimed to evaluate the association 
      between oxygen use and survival in patients with advanced cancer and low oxygen
      saturation in home care. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a 
      primary care practice in suburban Tokyo. Adult patients in home care with
      advanced cancer demonstrating first low oxygen saturation (less than 90%)
      detected in home visits were consecutively included in the study. Cox
      proportional hazards regression was used to investigate the effect of oxygen use 
      on overall survival and survival at home, adjusted for systolic blood pressure,
      decreased level of consciousness, dyspnea, oral intake, performance status, and
      cardiopulmonary comorbidity. Results: Of 433 identified patients with advanced
      cancer, we enrolled 137 patients (oxygen use, n = 35; no oxygen use, n = 102) who
      developed low oxygen saturation. In multivariable analysis, the adjusted hazard
      ratio (HR) of oxygen use was 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.39–1.17) for death
      and 0.70 (0.38–1.27) for death at home. In patients with dyspnea, the HR was 0.35
      (0.13–0.89) for death and 0.33 (0.11–0.96) for death at home; without dyspnea, it
      was 1.03 (0.49–2.17) for death and 0.84 (0.36–1.96) for death at home.
      Conclusions: Oxygen use was not significantly associated with survival in
      patients with advanced cancer and low oxygen saturation, after adjusting for
      potential confounders. It may not be necessary to use oxygen for prolongation of 
      survival in such patients, particularly in those without dyspnea.

TI  - A rapid positive influence of S-ketamine on the anxiety of patients in palliative
      care: a retrospective pilot study.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: Patients in palliative care need rapid-acting pharmacological options
      for psychological distress. N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine is known to 
      have a fast onset of anti-depressant and anxiolytic action. Its S-enantiomer
      S-ketamine (or esketamine) is an analgesic used as a routine treatment for
      refractory pain as an intravenous infusion (0.25 mg/kg over 45 min). This study
      investigates whether S-ketamine pain therapy has a positive impact on
      psychological distress caused by anxiety and depression in palliative care.
      Methods: Patient routine data from a palliative care unit of a tertiary care
      hospital were used in a retrospective analysis after positive ethics approval.
      Eight patients, who received analgesic S-ketamine treatment, were compared to a
      control group matched by gender and age. The main analysis was conducted using
      three-way mixed MANOVA followed by two-way mixed ANOVA. Target variables were the
      values for anxiety and depression in the state-trait anxiety-depression inventory
      STADI. The predictor variables were the time of measurement before (T1) and after
      (T2) S-ketamine application and group membership. Results: Comparison of the
      S-ketamine group (n = 8; 4 male, 4 female; average age 52 years) with the control
      group (n = 8; 3 male, 5 female; average age 55 years) revealed a significant
      multivariate effect on anxiety and depression F(1, 14) = 4.78; p = 0.046;
      r = 0.50. The univariate comparisons showed a significant reduction of the
      anxiety scores from T1 to T2 in the S-ketamine group compared to the control
      group F(1, 14) = 10.14; p = 0.007; r = 0.65. With regard to depression, there was
      no significant reduction from T1 to T2 in the group comparison F(1, 14) = 1.60;
      p = 0.23; r = 0.32. No long-lasting effects on pain were found. Conclusions: Our 
      findings show that psychological distress of patients in palliative care may
      improve after a single administration of S-ketamine, which mainly alleviates
      anxiety in those patients. Limitations of this study arise from
      non-randomization, retrospective analysis and low sample size. Therefore, further
      prospective and ideally randomized studies are necessary.

TI  - Cannabinoids and Opioids in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
LID - e00120
AB  - In traditional medicine, Cannabis sativa has been prescribed for a variety of
      diseases. Today, the plant is largely known for its recreational purpose, but it 
      may find a way back to what it was originally known for: a herbal remedy. Most of
      the plant's ingredients, such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol,
      cannabigerol, and others, have demonstrated beneficial effects in preclinical
      models of intestinal inflammation. Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids)
      have shown a regulatory role in inflammation and mucosal permeability of the
      gastrointestinal tract where they likely interact with the gut microbiome.
      Anecdotal reports suggest that in humans, Cannabis exerts antinociceptive,
      anti-inflammatory, and antidiarrheal properties. Despite these reports, strong
      evidence on beneficial effects of Cannabis in human gastrointestinal diseases is 
      lacking. Clinical trials with Cannabis in patients suffering from inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) have shown improvement in quality of life but failed to
      provide evidence for a reduction of inflammation markers. Within the endogenous
      opioid system, mu opioid receptors may be involved in anti-inflammation of the
      gut. Opioids are frequently used to treat abdominal pain in IBD; however, heavy
      opioid use in IBD is associated with opioid dependency and higher mortality. This
      review highlights latest advances in the potential treatment of IBD using
      Cannabis/cannabinoids or opioids.

TI  - The Evolving Microbiome from Pregnancy to Early Infancy: A Comprehensive Review.
LID - 133
AB  - Pregnancy induces a number of immunological, hormonal, and metabolic changes that
      are necessary for the mother to adapt her body to this new physiological
      situation. The microbiome of the mother, the placenta and the fetus influence the
      fetus growth and undoubtedly plays a major role in the adequate development of
      the newborn infant. Hence, the microbiome modulates the inflammatory mechanisms
      related to physiological and pathological processes that are involved in the
      perinatal progress through different mechanisms. The present review summarizes
      the actual knowledge related to physiological changes in the microbiota occurring
      in the mother, the fetus, and the child, both during neonatal period and beyond. 
      In addition, we approach some specific pathological situations during the
      perinatal periods, as well as the influence of the type of delivery and feeding.

TI  - Administration of Nebulized Ketamine for Managing Acute Pain in the Emergency
      Department: A Case Series.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - Ketamine administration in sub-dissociative doses in the emergency department
      (ED) results in effective pain relief in patients with acute traumatic and
      non-traumatic pain, chronic pain, and opioid-tolerant pain. This case series
      describes five adult ED patients who received nebulized ketamine for
      predominantly acute traumatic pain. Three patients received nebulized ketamine at
      1.5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) dose, one patient at 0.75 mg/kg, and one
      patient at 1 mg/kg. All five patients experienced a decrease in pain from the
      baseline up to 120 minutes. The inhalation route of ketamine delivery via
      breath-actuated nebulizer may have utility for managing pain in the ED.

TI  - A Pain eHealth Platform for Engaging Obese, Older Adults with Chronic Low Back
      Pain in Nonpharmacological Pain Treatments: Protocol for a Pilot Feasibility
      Study.
LID - e14525
AB  - Background: Low back pain is a costly healthcare problem and the leading cause of
      disability among adults in the United States. Primary care providers urgently
      need effective ways to deliver evidence-based, nonpharmacological therapies for
      chronic low back pain. Guidelines published by several government and national
      organizations have recommended nonpharmacological and nonopioid pharmacological
      therapies for low back pain. Objective: The Pain eHealth Platform (PEP) pilot
      trial aims to test the feasibility of a highly innovative intervention that (1)
      uses an electronic health record (EHR) query to systematically identify a
      phenotype of obese, older adults with chronic low back pain who may benefit from 
      Web-based behavioral treatments; (2) delivers highly tailored messages to
      eligible older adults with chronic low back pain via the patient portal; (3)
      links affected patients to a Web app that provides education on the efficacy of
      evidence-based, nonpharmacological, behavioral pain treatments; and (4) directs
      patients to existing Web-based health treatment tools. Methods: Using a
      three-step modified Delphi method, an expert panel of primary care providers will
      define a low back pain phenotype for an EHR query. Using the defined low back
      pain phenotype, an EHR query will be created to identify patients who may benefit
      from the PEP. Up to 15 patients with low back pain will be interviewed to refine 
      the tailored messaging, esthetics, and content of the patient-facing Web app
      within the PEP. Up to 10 primary care providers will be interviewed to better
      understand the facilitators and barriers to implementing the PEP, given their
      clinic workflow. We will assess the feasibility of the PEP in a single-arm
      pragmatic pilot study in which secure patient portal invitations containing a
      hyperlink to the PEP Web app are sent to 1000 patients. The primary outcome of
      the study is usability as measured by the System Usability Scale. Results:
      Qualitative interviews with primary care providers were completed in April 2019. 
      Qualitative interviews with patients will begin in December 2019. Conclusions:
      The PEP will leverage informatics and the patient portal to deliver
      evidence-based nonpharmacological treatment information to adults with chronic
      low back pain. Results from this study may help inform the development of
      Web-based health platforms for other pain and chronic health conditions.

TI  - Potentially inappropriate prescribing in dementia: a state-of-the-art review
      since 2007.
LID - e029172
AB  - Objectives: Dementia frequently occurs alongside comorbidities. Coexisting
      conditions are often managed with multiple medications, leading to increased risk
      of potentially inappropriate medication and adverse drug reactions. We aimed to
      estimate prevalence of, and identify factors reported to be associated with,
      potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) for older individuals diagnosed with 
      dementia. Design: We used a state-of-the-art review approach, selecting papers
      written in English and published from 2007 to January 2018. Publications were
      retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria included a
      formal diagnosis of dementia, a formal classification of PIP and reported
      prevalence of PIP as an outcome. Random effects models were used to provide a
      pooled estimate of prevalence of PIP. The Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional
      Studies (AXIS tool) was used to assess bias in the included studies. Results: The
      bibliographic search yielded 221 citations, with 12 studies meeting the inclusion
      criteria. The estimates of PIP prevalence for people living with dementia ranged 
      from 14% to 64%. Prevalence was 31% (95% CI 9 to 52) in the community, and 42%
      (95% CI 30 to 55) in nursing/care homes. PIP included prescribing likely related 
      to dementia (eg, hypnotics and sedative and cholinesterase inhibitors) and
      prescribing related to treatment of comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular drugs and
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication). Higher levels of comorbidity were
      associated with increased risk of PIP; however, only one study investigated
      associations with specific comorbidities of dementia. Conclusion: PIP remains a
      significant issue in healthcare management for people living with dementia.
      Higher levels of comorbidity are associated with increased prevalence of PIP, but
      the specific conditions driving this increase remain unknown. Further work is
      necessary to investigate PIP related to the presence of common comorbidities in
      patients living with dementia.

      spinal-epidural anesthesia in labor analgesia.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: To compare the application and efficacy of ropivacaine combined with 
      sufentanil for continuous epidural anesthesia (CEA) and combined spinal-epidural 
      anesthesia (CSEA) in labor analgesia. Methods: Three hundred sixty pregnant women
      requesting labor analgesia from October 2017 to August 2018 were selected
      retrospectively. According to the anesthetic method, subjects were divided into
      CSEA group and CEA group. Ropivacaine combined with sufentanil were used in all
      subjects. The labor time, visual analogue scale (VAS), Apgar score of newborn,
      adverse pregnancy outcomes and adverse drug reactions were observed. Results:
      There was no significant difference in pre-analgesia (T0) VAS scores between the 
      two groups (P > 0.05). VAS scores of first stage of labor (T1), second stage of
      labor (T2) and third stage of labor (T3) in CSEA group were significantly lower
      than CEA group (P < 0.01). The onset time, T1 and total labor time in CSEA group 
      were significantly shorter than CEA group (P < 0.01). There were no significant
      differences between T2 and T3 (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences
      in adverse pregnancy outcomes and Apgar scores at 1, 5 and 10 min after birth
      between the two groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of adverse drug outcomes in CSEA
      group was significantly lower than CEA group (P < 0.01). Maternal satisfaction in
      CSEA group was significantly higher than CEA group (P < 0.01). Conclusion:
      Considering ropivacaine combined with sufentanil for CSEA achieved a shorter
      onset time and labor period, significant analgesic effect, lower adverse drug
      reactions rates and higher subject satisfaction than CEA, it may be worthy of
      clinical promotion and application.

TI  - Clinical outcomes with endoscopic resection of lumbar extradural cysts.
PG  - S133-44
AB  - Background: Lumbar extradural cysts may be associated with sciatica-type back and
      leg pain. The symptoms of clinical pain syndrome from synovial cysts are
      sometimes difficult to differentiate from those of lumbar disc herniation or
      spinal canal stenosis and may be identified to be a pain source when visualized
      endoscopically. The authors analyzed the clinical outcomes with their endoscopic 
      resection to better establish clinical indications and prognosticators of
      favorable results. Methods: Two-year Macnab outcomes, VAS scores, and
      complications were analyzed in a series of 48 patients treated with the
      endoscopic removal of extradural cyst encountered during routine transforaminal
      and interlaminar decompression for foraminal and lateral recess stenosis causing 
      lumbar radiculopathy. Results: There were 26 female and 22 male patients. The
      extradural cysts were most commonly encountered at L4/5 level in 26 patients
      (72.2%) followed by the L5/S1 level in 8 patients (22.2%), and in 2 patients
      (5.6%) at the L3/4 level, respectively. One patient underwent T9/10
      decompression. At minimum 2-year follow-up, all patients were improved. Excellent
      results according to the Macnab criteria were obtained in 19/48 (39.6%) patients,
      good in 18/48 (37.5%), and fair in 11/48 (22.9%), respectively. The average
      preoperative VAS score for leg pain was 8.06±1.57 and reduced at a statistically 
      significant level (P<0.000) postoperatively to 1.92±1.49, and 1.77±1.32 at final 
      follow-up, respectively. The percentage of patients with unlimited walking
      endurance had improved at a statistically significant level (P<0.0001) from 33.3%
      preoperatively (16/48) to 81.3% (39/48) postoperatively. One patient had a
      recurrent disc herniation, and another patient did not improve. Two patients
      underwent fusion during the follow-up period. Patients with Fair outcomes had a
      statistically significant association (P<0.001) with facet instability as
      suggested by axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of
      thickened ligamentum flavum, facet joint hypertrophy, and bright white
      fluid-filled joint gap of >2 mm. Conclusions: Endoscopic resection of extradural 
      spinal cysts during routine decompression for symptomatic foraminal and lateral
      recess stenosis is feasible with favorable clinical outcomes in the majority of
      patients. Fair outcomes were associated with advanced instability of the involved
      lumbar facet joint complex.

TI  - Comparison of Continuous Epidural Infusion of Bupivacaine and Fentanyl Versus
      Patient Controlled Analgesia Techniques for Labor Analgesia: A Randomized
      Controlled Trial (RCT).
PG  - 42-8
AB  - Background:: To diminish labor pain, several techniques have been used in
      developed countries. In the current randomized controlled trial, the use of
      epidural analgesia via PCEA pump with and without background infusion of
      analgesic was studied. Methods:: In this double-blinded controlled trial, 60
      women were enrolled and randomly assigned to study groups for receiving epidural 
      analgesia during labor. All patients received initial bullous dose including 125 
      mg bupivacaine and 3 mg/ml fentanyl, and the first group patient (CI) received
      background infusion of 8 ml/hr and the second group (PCEA) received 10 ml bullous
      dose of 125 mg bupivacaine combined with 100 mcg fentanyl (2 ml) via epidural
      catheter. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of 0–10 was measured 20 min after drug 
      injection. The chi-square and student T-test were used for comparing variables
      between groups, and 0.05 was considered as the level of significance. Results::
      There was no significant difference in terms of demographic variables. Mean
      duration of the second stage of labor was significantly lower in patients
      received continuous infusion (CI) (p<0.0001). However, the total administered
      fentanyl dose was significantly higher in patients who underwent PCEA (p<0.0001).
      Besides, the CI group had a significantly lower rate of patient-controlled
      injection compared to PCEA patients (p<0.0001). However, there was no significant
      difference between patients’ satisfaction and VAS in study groups. Conclusion::
      Epidural analgesia using PCEA combined with continuous infusion did not provide
      higher analgesia or patients’ satisfaction compared to PCEA alone; however, it
      led to a decreased rate of drug injection and total administered dosage.

TI  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for the Management of Multiple Sclerosis–Related
      Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 8-14
AB  - Background:: Pain is a common and often debilitating symptom in persons with
      multiple sclerosis (MS). Besides interfering with daily functioning, pain in MS
      is associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Although cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain has been found to be an effective treatment in 
      other populations, there has been a dearth of research in persons with MS.
      Methods:: Persons with MS with at least moderate pain severity (N = 20) were
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: CBT plus standard care or MS-related
      education plus standard care, each of which met for 12 sessions. Changes in pain 
      severity, pain interference, and depressive symptom severity from baseline to
      15-week follow-up were assessed using a 2×2 factorial design. Participants also
      rated their satisfaction with their treatment and accomplishment of personally
      meaningful behavioral goals. Results:: Both treatment groups rated their
      treatment satisfaction as very high and their behavioral goals as largely met,
      although only the CBT plus standard care group's mean goal accomplishment ratings
      represented significant improvement. Although there were no significant
      differences between groups after treatment on the three primary outcomes, there
      was an overall improvement over time for pain severity, pain interference, and
      depressive symptom severity. Conclusions:: Cognitive behavioral therapy or
      education-based programs may be helpful adjunctive treatments for persons with MS
      experiencing pain.

TI  - Antipsychotic Use in the Prevention and Treatment of Intensive Care Unit Delirium
      in Pediatric Patients.
PG  - 81-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the antipsychotics, route of administration, dosage
      regimen, and outcomes reported to prevent or treat delirium in hospitalized
      children. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts
      were searched using the keywords “haloperidol,” “olanzapine,” “quetiapine,”
      “risperidone,” “ziprasidone,” and “delirium.” Articles evaluating the use of
      these agents to manage delirium in hospitalized children that were published
      between 1946 and August 2019 were included. Two authors independently screened
      each article for inclusion. Reports were excluded if they were published
      abstracts or included fewer than 3 patients in the report. RESULTS: Thirteen
      reports that included 370 children receiving haloperidol, quetiapine, olanzapine,
      and/or risperidone for delirium treatment were reviewed. Most children received
      haloperidol (n = 131) or olanzapine (n = 125). Significant variability in dosing 
      was noted. A total of 23 patients (6.2%) had an adverse drug event, including 13 
      (56.5%) who experienced dystonia and 3 (13.0%) with a prolonged corrected QT
      interval. Most reports described improvement in delirium symptoms; however, only 
      5 reports used a validated screening tool for PICU delirium to evaluate
      antipsychotic response. CONCLUSIONS: Most reports noted efficacy with
      antipsychotics, but these reports were limited by sample size and lacked a
      validated PICU delirium tool. Future research is needed to determine the optimal 
      agent and dosage regimen to treat PICU delirium.

TI  - Evaluating the Transition From Dexmedetomidine to Clonidine for the Prevention of
      Withdrawal in Critically Ill Pediatric Patients.
PG  - 104-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clonidine for preventing withdrawal from dexmedetomidine 
      infusions and describe the incidence of withdrawal symptoms and adverse
      cardiovascular effects in critically ill pediatric patients. METHODS:
      Retrospective, descriptive study of patients in Advocate Children's Hospital-Park
      Ridge PICU who received dexmedetomidine infusion for ≥72 hours, followed by
      clonidine for ≥48 hours, between January 1, 2015, and August 31, 2017. RESULTS:
      Thirty-eight patients (median age 4.3 years; IQR, 2–11.5) received 39
      dexmedetomidine courses. The median duration of dexmedetomidine exposure was 7.6 
      days (IQR, 5–11.5) at an average dose of 1 mcg/kg/hr. The median dose of
      clonidine at initiation was 8.3 mcg/kg/day (for <50 kg) and 4.1 mcg/kg/day (for
      ≥50 kg). The most common oral administration frequency was every 8 hours.
      Dexmedetomidine infusions for 7 days or longer and a higher dexmedetomidine dose 
      24 hours prior to clonidine transition both correlated with increased initial
      clonidine doses. Fourteen patients (37%) had at least 1 WAT-1 score of ≥3 during 
      the transition between dexmedetomidine and clonidine, with 7 (18%) requiring an
      increase in sedation. Adverse cardiovascular events were possibly attributable to
      dexmedetomidine and/or clonidine in 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving
      prolonged infusions of dexmedetomidine may transition to clonidine to help
      prevent withdrawal symptoms. Duration of dexmedetomidine infusion of 7 days or
      longer and higher average dexmedetomidine dose 24 hours prior to the transition
      are important considerations when determining the initial clonidine dose.
      Transition from dexmedetomidine to clonidine was found to be safe and efficacious
      in our patients, with minimal adverse effects.

PG  - 54-60
AB  - Elderly patients suffering from chronic cardio-pulmonary diseases commonly
      experience acute respiratory failure. As in younger patients, a well-known
      therapeutic approach of noninvasive mechanical ventilation is able to prevent
      orotracheal intubation in a large number of severe scenarios in elderly patients.
      In addition, this type of ventilation is frequently applied in elderly patients
      who refuse intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. The rate of failure of
      noninvasive ventilation may be reduced by means of the integration of new
      technological devices (i.e., high-flow nasal cannula, extracorporeal CO2 removal,
      cough assistance and high-frequency chest wall oscillation, and fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy). Ethical issues with end-of-life decisions and the choice of the
      environment are not clearly defined in the treatment of elderly with acute
      respiratory insufficiency.

      Research Center Sefakoy Hospital. Five groups were formed according to
      postoperative analgesia methods which were planned to be compared; Group-I.
      penile block, Group-II. Caudal epidural block, Group-III. subcutaneous ring
      block, Group-IV as intravenous paracetamol and Group-V as intravenous tramadol
      HCl. In order to evaluate the postoperative pain levels of children, Children’s
      Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) was filled at 30, 60, 120, 180
      minutes after circumcision by a researcher who does not know which method was
      applied. Results:: No significant difference is found between the groups
      (p>0.05). In the statistical analysis, no significant difference was found in the
      effect of analgesia methods on CHEOPS scores between 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes 
      (p>0.05). In parallel with this result, no significant difference was found in
      the effect of heart beat rates and respiration rate averages between 30, 60, 120 
      and 180 minutes (p>0.05). Conclusion:: It has been shown that none of the five
      method has any superiority in reducing pain after circumcision and that all five 
      methods can be used. However, we think that side effects of regional anesthesia
      and systemic analgesic applications should not be ignored.

TI  - Sex Differences Revealed in a Mouse CFA Inflammation Model with Macrophage
      Targeted Nanotheranostics.
PG  - 1694-707
AB  - Monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) infiltrate sites of infection or injury and
      upregulate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme that stimulates prostaglandin-E2
      (PgE2). Nanotheranostics combine therapeutic and diagnostic agents into a single 
      nanosystem. In previous studies, we demonstrated that a nanotheranostic strategy,
      based on theranostic nanoemulsions (NE) loaded with a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib,
      CXB) and equipped with near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) reporters, can
      specifically target circulating monocytes and MDMs. The anti-inflammatory and
      anti-nociceptive effects of such cell-specific COX-2 inhibition lasted several
      days following Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) or nerve injury in male mice. The
      overall goal of this study was to investigate the extended (up to 40 days) impact
      of MDM-targeted COX-2 inhibition and any sex-based differences in treatment
      response; both of which remain unknown. Our study also evaluates the feasibility 
      and efficacy of a preclinical nanotheranostic strategy for mechanistic
      investigation of the impact of such sex differences on clinical outcomes.Methods:
      CFA was administered into the right hind paws of male and female mice. All mice
      received a single intravenous dose of NIRF labeled CXB loaded NE twelve hours
      prior to CFA injection. In vivo whole body NIRF imaging and mechanical
      hypersensitivity assays were performed sequentially and ex vivo NIRF imaging and 
      immunohistopathology of foot pad tissues were performed at the end point of 40
      days.Results: Targeted COX-2 inhibition of MDMs in male and female mice
      successfully improved mechanical hypersensitivity after CFA injury. However, we
      observed distinct sex-specific differences in the intensity or longevity of the
      nociceptive responses. In males, a single dose of CXB-NE administered via tail
      vein injection produced significant improved mechanical hypersensitivity for 32
      days as compared to the drug free NE (DF-NE) (untreated) control group. In
      females, CXB-NE produced similar, though less prominent and shorter-lived
      effects, lasting up to 11 days. NIRF imaging confirmed that CXB-NE can be
      detected up to day 40 in the CFA injected foot pad tissues of both sexes. There
      were distinct signal distribution trends between males and females, suggesting
      differences in macrophage infiltration dynamics between the sexes. This may also 
      relate to differences in macrophage turnover rate between the sexes, a
      possibility that requires further investigation in this model.Conclusions: For
      the first time, this study provides unique insight into MDM dynamics and the
      early as well as longer-term targeted effects and efficacy of a clinically
      translatable nanotheranostic agent on MDM mediated inflammation. Our data
      supports the potential of nanotheranostics as presented in elucidating the
      kinetics, dynamics and sex-based differences in the adaptive or innate immune
      responses to inflammatory triggers. Taken together, our study findings lead us
      closer to true personalized, sex-specific pain nanomedicine for a wide range of
      inflammatory diseases.

      US Women, 2007–2017.
PG  - S100-8
AB  - Objectives. To examine whether women’s incarceration increases numbers of total
      and new sexual partners.Methods. US women with or at risk for HIV in a
      multicenter cohort study answered incarceration and sexual partner questions
      semiannually between 2007 and 2017. We used marginal structural models to compare
      total and new partners at visits not following incarceration with all visits
      following incarceration and visits immediately following incarceration.
      Covariates included demographics, HIV status, sex exchange, drug or alcohol use, 
      and housing instability.Results. Of the 3180 participants, 155 were incarcerated.
      Women reported 2 partners, 3 or more partners, and new partners at 5.2%, 5.2%,
      and 9.3% of visits, respectively. Relative to visits not occurring after
      incarceration, odds ratios were 2.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20, 4.85) 
      for 2 partners, 2.03 (95% CI = 0.97, 4.26) for 3 or more partners, and 3.24 (95% 
      CI = 1.69, 6.22) for new partners at visits immediately after incarceration. Odds
      ratios were similar for all visits following incarceration.Conclusions. Women had
      more total partners and new partners immediately and at all visits following
      incarceration after confounders and loss to follow-up had been taken into
      account.

TI  - The Effect of Health Insurance on Health Care Utilization in the Justice-Involved
      Population: United States, 2014–2016.
PG  - S78-84
AB  - Objectives. To examine the impact of health insurance coverage on utilization of 
      outpatient, hospital, and emergency department care among justice-involved
      individuals in the United States.Methods. We performed repeated cross-sectional
      analyses with data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. The study
      population included 6086 adults with justice involvement within the past year. We
      used logistic regression to examine the odds of health care utilization based on 
      either a dichotomous or categorical measure of health insurance coverage. We used
      negative binomial regression to examine the number of times a specific type of
      care was utilized with both a dichotomous measure of health insurance coverage
      and a categorical measure of type of health insurance.Results. Health insurance
      was associated with increased utilization of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency
      department care.Conclusions. Health insurance coverage was associated with
      increased utilization of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department health
      care among justice-involved individuals. Therefore, expanding access to health
      insurance in this population has the potential to increase care utilization of
      all types and decrease barriers to medical services.

TI  - Voluntary modulation of saccadic peak velocity associated with individual
      differences in motivation.
PG  - 198-212
AB  - Saccadic peak velocity increases in a stereotyped manner with the amplitude of
      eye movements. This relationship, known as the main sequence, has classically
      been considered to be fixed, although several recent studies have demonstrated
      that velocity can be modulated to some extent by external incentives. However,
      the ability to voluntarily control saccadic velocity and its association with
      motivation has yet to be investigated. Here, in three separate experimental
      paradigms, we measured the effects of incentivisation on saccadic velocity,
      reaction time and preparatory pupillary changes in 53 young healthy participants.
      In addition, the ability to voluntarily modulate saccadic velocity with and
      without incentivisation was assessed. Participants varied in their ability to
      increase and decrease the velocity of their saccades when instructed to do so.
      This effect correlated with motivation level across participants, and was further
      modulated by addition of monetary reward and avoidance of loss. The findings show
      that a degree of voluntary control of saccadic velocity is possible in some
      individuals, and that the ability to modulate peak velocity is associated with
      intrinsic levels of motivation.

TI  - Effect of preemptive analgesia with ibuprofen in the control of postoperative
      pain in dental implant surgeries: A randomized, triple-blind controlled clinical 
      trial.
PG  - e71-8
AB  - Background: Preemptive analgesia has as its basic principle the administration of
      analgesics before the onset of painful stimuli, in order to reduce or prevent
      postoperative pain, but this question is little explored in implantology. Thus,
      this study was conducted in order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ibuprofen 
      in pain prevention after unit implant surgery. Material and Methods: For this
      triple-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trial, 54
      insertion surgeries of unitary implants were performed. Two groups have received 
      two different protocols 1 hour before surgery: Ibuprofen group (IBU) 600 mg of
      ibuprofen; and (2) placebo group (maize starch). The intensity of the pain was
      evaluated through the visual analogue scale (VAS) in 6 times (1, 6, 12, 24, 48
      and 72 hours after the surgery). Patients were instructed to take 750 mg of
      paracetamol as rescue medication, if necessary. The occurrence and the intensity 
      of pain were analyzed by means of an analysis of variance ANOVA with repeated
      measurements using the general linear model procedure. Results: The IBU group had
      significantly lower VAS scores overall (IBU = 0.30, ± 0.57; placebo = 1.14, ±
      1.07; p<0.001) and at all times in the intra, intergroup comparisons and
      time/group interaction than the placebo group (p<0.001). The use of rescue
      medication was significantly lower and the postoperative time was longer in the
      IBU group compared to placebo (p = 0.002). Conclusions: The single use of
      ibuprofen was found to be significantly superior in reducing pain after unit
      implant surgery compared to placebo. Key words:Analgesia, dental implants, pain, 
      surgery, oral.

TI  - Nicotinic-nAChR signaling mediates drug resistance in lung cancer.
PG  - 1125-40
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Cigarette smoking is 
      the most common risk factor for lung carcinoma; other risks include genetic
      factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, secondhand smoke, and air pollution.
      Nicotine, the primary addictive constituent of cigarettes, contributes to cancer 
      progression through activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs),
      which are membrane ligand-gated ion channels. Activation of nicotine/nAChR
      signaling is associated with lung cancer risk and drug resistance. We focused on 
      nAChR pathways activated by nicotine and its downstream signaling involved in
      regulating apoptotic factors of mitochondria and drug resistance in lung cancer. 
      Increasing evidence suggests that several sirtuins play a critical role in
      multiple aspects of cancer drug resistance. Thus, understanding the consequences 
      of crosstalk between nicotine/nAChRs and sirtuin signaling pathways in the
      regulation of drug resistance could be a critical implication for cancer therapy.

TI  - The Evolving Pharmacotherapeutic Landscape for the Treatment of Sickle Cell
      Disease.
LID - e2020010
AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an extremely heterogeneous disease that has been
      associated with global morbidity and early mortality. More effective and
      inexpensive therapies are needed. During the last five years, the landscape of
      the pharmacotherapy of SCD has changed dramatically. Currently, 54 drugs have
      been used or under consideration to use for the treatment of SCD. These fall into
      3 categories: the first category includes the four drugs (Hydroxyurea,
      L-Glutamine, Crizanlizumab tmca and Voxelotor) that have been approved by the
      United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on successful clinical
      trials. The second category includes 22 drugs that failed, discontinued or
      terminated for now and the third category includes 28 drugs that are actively
      being considered for the treatment of SCD. Crizanlizumab and Voxelotor are
      included in the first and third categories because they have been used in more
      than one trial. New therapies targeting multiple pathways in the complex
      pathophysiology of SCD have been achieved or are under continued investigation.
      The emerging trend seems to be the use of multimodal drugs (i.e. drugs that have 
      different mechanisms of action) to treat SCD similar to the use of multiple
      chemotherapeutic agents to treat cancer.

TI  - Perioperative duloxetine as part of a multimodal analgesia regime reduces
      postoperative pain in lumbar canal stenosis surgery: a randomized, triple blind, 
      and placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 40-7
AB  - Background: Duloxetine is an antidepressant that is also useful in chronic
      neuropathic and central origin pain. In this study, the role of duloxetine in
      decreasing acute postoperative pain after lumbar canal stenosis surgery is
      explored. Methods: In this single center, triple blinded, and placebo-controlled 
      trial, 96 patients were randomized for statistical analysis. The intervention
      group received oral duloxetine 30 mg once a day (OD) for 2 days before surgery,
      60 mg OD from the day of surgery to the postoperative second day and 30 mg OD for
      the next 2 days (a total duration of 7 days). A placebo capsule was given in the 
      other group for a similar time and schedule. The same standard perioperative
      analgesia protocols were followed in both groups. Results: Total morphine
      consumption up to 24 hours was significantly decreased in the duloxetine group (P
      < 0.01). The time to the first analgesia requirement was similar in both groups
      but the time to the second and third dose of rescue analgesia increased
      significantly in the duloxetine group. The time to ambulation was decreased
      significantly (P < 0.01) in the duloxetine group as compared to the placebo
      group. Pain scores remained similar during most of the time interval. No
      significant difference was observed in the complication rate and patient
      satisfaction score recorded. Conclusions: Duloxetine reduces postoperative pain
      after lumbar canal stenosis surgery with no increase in adverse effects.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine during suprazygomatic maxillary nerve block for pediatric cleft
      palate repair, randomized double-blind controlled study.
PG  - 81-9
AB  - Background: For children with cleft palates, surgeries at a young age are
      necessary to reduce feeding or phonation difficulties and reduce complications,
      especially respiratory tract infections and frequent sinusitis. We hypothesized
      that dexmedetomidine might prolong the postoperative analgesic duration when
      added to bupivacaine during nerve blocks. Methods: Eighty patients of 1–5 years
      old were arbitrarily assigned to two equal groups (forty patients each) to
      receive bilateral suprazygomatic maxillary nerve blocks. Group A received
      bilateral 0.2 mL/kg bupivacaine (0.125%; maximum volume 4 mL/side). Group B
      received bilateral 0.2 mL/kg bupivacaine (0.125%) + 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine
      (maximum volume 4 mL/side). Results: The modified children’s hospital of Eastern 
      Ontario pain scale score was significantly lower in group B children after 8
      hours of follow-up postoperatively (P < 0.001). Mean values of heart rate and
      blood pressure were significantly different between the groups, with lower mean
      values in group B (P < 0.001). Median time to the first analgesic demand in group
      A children was 10 hours (range 8–12 hr), and no patients needed analgesia in
      group B. The sedation score assessment was higher in children given
      dexmedetomidine (P = 0.03) during the first postoperative 30 minutes. Better
      parent satisfaction scores (5-point Likert scale) were recorded in group B and
      without serious adverse effects. Conclusions: Addition of dexmedetomidine 0.5
      μg/kg to bupivacaine 0.125% has accentuated the analgesic efficacy of bilateral
      suprazygomatic maxillary nerve block in children undergoing primary cleft palate 
      repair with less postoperative supplemental analgesia or untoward effects.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitude and Practices of Labor Analgesia amongst healthcare workers
      and patients: a single center cross sectional study.
PG  - S4-8
AB  - Background and Objective:: Childbirth ranks amongst the most painful experiences 
      a woman has to endure. In developing countries issues related to awareness,
      acceptability and availability of analgesia exist. This study aims to assess the 
      knowledge, attitude and practices for labor analgesia amongst healthcare workers 
      and patients. Methods:: We performed a cross-sectional study conducted at Shaikh 
      Saeed Memorial Campus of The Indus Hospital (TIH), Karachi. The study was
      performed in November 2016. Two surveys were conducted for this study; one for
      healthcare workers with patient interaction and second on patients attending
      their first antenatal clinic. The participants were asked to complete a survey
      following consent. Results:: A total of 71 healthcare workers and 1005 patients
      participated in the study. Among healthcare workers, 43.7% felt that pain relief 
      should be administered, 14.1% believed analgesia had adverse effects on fetus and
      11.3% reported increased risk of cesarean section. Results from patients showed
      27.9% were aware of labor analgesia and when informed, 85.2% were willing to have
      labor analgesia. In 14.1% of patients, labor analgesia was unsupported as they
      stated being a mother meant to endure pain. Conclusion:: There is a wide gap
      between knowledge and practice of labor analgesia. Healthcare workers have a role
      in educating women, to be advocates for labor analgesia and to educate patients
      timely for this service.

TI  - Comorbid Chronic Conditions Among Older Adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline,
      United States, 2015–2017.
LID - igz045
AB  - Background and Objectives: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the self-reported 
      experience of worsening or more frequent confusion or memory loss, may be
      associated with the development or worsening of chronic conditions or
      complicating their self-management. The objectives of this study were to (i)
      establish the prevalence of chronic conditions and multiple chronic conditions
      among adults with SCD, and (ii) compare the prevalence of chronic conditions
      among people with and without SCD and SCD-related functional limitations.
      Research Design and Methods: Data were analyzed from the Cognitive Decline module
      of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System administered in 49 states, DC, 
      and Puerto Rico during 2015–2017. Analyses included 220,221 respondents aged 45
      years or older who answered the SCD screening question and reported their chronic
      conditions. Weighted estimates were calculated and chi-square tests were used for
      comparisons. Results: Persons with a history of stroke, heart disease, and
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder had significantly higher prevalence of SCD
      compared to those without. The prevalence of having at least one chronic
      condition was higher among adults with SCD compared to adults without SCD in each
      age group (45–64 years: 77.4% vs 47.1%, p < .001; ≥65 years: 86.3% vs 73.5%, p < 
      .001). Among those with SCD, the prevalence of an SCD-related functional
      limitation was higher among those with at least one chronic condition compared to
      those with none (45–64 years: 63.3% vs 42.4%, p < .001; ≥65 years: 40.0% vs
      25.1%, p < .001). Only half of adults with SCD and a chronic condition had
      discussed their SCD with a health care professional. Discussion and Implications:
      SCD and chronic conditions commonly co-occur. Having a chronic condition was
      associated with greater SCD-related functional limitations. SCD might complicate 
      the management of chronic conditions, and patients and providers should be aware 
      of increased risk for cognitive decline in the presence of chronic diseases.

TI  - Medication Use in Schools: Current Trends, Challenges, and Best Practices.
PG  - 7-24
AB  - There are a significant number of students on maintenance medications for chronic
      diseases or with diagnoses that may result in medical emergencies requiring
      administration of medications in school. With passing of legislation in all 50
      states allowing self-administration of emergency medications for allergic
      reactions and asthma, the landscape of medication use in schools is changing.
      These changes have raised questions about the need for legislation or policy
      development relating to self-carrying and self-administration of medications for 
      other disease states, undesignated stock of emergency medications, and
      administration of medications by non-medical personnel. Medication administration
      in the school setting has become a complex issue, and this review will discuss
      current legislation related to medication use in schools and provide best
      practices for administering medications to children and adolescents while at
      school.

TI  - The Use of Yoga as a Group Intervention for Pediatric Chronic Pain
      Rehabilitation: Exploring Qualitative and Quantitative Outcomes.
PG  - 55-61
AB  - Purpose:: With the increase in opioid use over the last decade, mind–body
      approaches to pediatric pain management have been trending. To date, there is
      limited research regarding the use of yoga with pediatric chronic pain. This
      study aims to gauge the effectiveness of group yoga as part of chronic pain
      rehabilitation and one's ability to continue practicing independently by
      exploring qualitative and quantitative information. Methods:: A single therapist 
      used yoga as a group physical therapy intervention once a week for 60 minutes.
      Yoga education, iyengar yoga components, relaxation, and stretching were
      incorporated into the therapeutic yoga session. Qualitative and quantitative
      information was collected. Results:: Qualitative outcomes provided valuable data 
      about distractions and benefits. Quantitative outcomes showed that there were
      significant improvements in areas such as mental tension, emotional tension,
      muscle tension, and pain (all P < 0.001 significant). Conclusion:: Pediatric
      chronic pain patients can identify many benefits after a single group yoga
      session. It combines the physical and cognitive aspects of interdisciplinary pain
      rehabilitation for continued use after discharge. The use of yoga is an
      economical means of physical activity after discharge to promote long-term
      benefits.

      Detailed Story from Injury to Recovery.
PG  - 116-34
AB  - Peripheral nerve injury is a complex condition with a variety of signs and
      symptoms such as numbness, tingling, jabbing, throbbing, burning or sharp pain.
      Peripheral nerves are fragile in nature and can easily get damaged due to acute
      compression or trauma which may lead to the sensory and motor functions deficits 
      and even lifelong disability. After lesion, the neuronal cell body becomes
      disconnected from the axon's distal portion to the injury site leading to the
      axonal degeneration and dismantlement of neuromuscular junctions of targeted
      muscles. In spite of extensive research on this aspect, complete functional
      recovery still remains a challenge to be resolved. This review highlights
      detailed pathophysiological events after an injury to a peripheral nerve and the 
      associated factors that can either hinder or promote the regenerative machinery. 
      In addition, it throws light on the available therapeutic strategies including
      supporting therapies, surgical and non-surgical interventions to ameliorate the
      axonal regeneration, neuronal survival, and reinnervation of peripheral targets. 
      Despite the availability of various treatment options, we are still lacking the
      optimal treatments for a perfect and complete functional regain. The need for the
      present age is to discover or design such potent compounds that would be able to 
      execute the complete functional retrieval. In this regard, plant-derived
      compounds are getting more attention and several recent reports validate their
      remedial effects. A plethora of plants and plant-derived phytochemicals have been
      suggested with curative effects against a number of diseases in general and
      neuronal injury in particular. They can be a ray of hope for the suffering
      individuals.

TI  - Opioid Use Fueling HIV Transmission in an Urban Setting: An Outbreak of HIV
      Infection Among People Who Inject Drugs—Massachusetts, 2015–2018.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - Objectives. To describe and control an outbreak of HIV infection among people who
      inject drugs (PWID).Methods. The investigation included people diagnosed with HIV
      infection during 2015 to 2018 linked to 2 cities in northeastern Massachusetts
      epidemiologically or through molecular analysis. Field activities included
      qualitative interviews regarding service availability and HIV risk
      behaviors.Results. We identified 129 people meeting the case definition; 116
      (90%) reported injection drug use. Molecular surveillance added 36 cases to the
      outbreak not otherwise linked. The 2 largest molecular groups contained 56 and 23
      cases. Most interviewed PWID were homeless. Control measures, including enhanced 
      field epidemiology, syringe services programming, and community outreach,
      resulted in a significant decline in new HIV diagnoses.Conclusions. We illustrate
      difficulties with identification and characterization of an outbreak of HIV
      infection among a population of PWID and the value of an intensive
      response.Public Health Implications. Responding to and preventing outbreaks
      requires ongoing surveillance, with timely detection of increases in HIV
      diagnoses, community partnerships, and coordinated services, all critical to
      achieving the goal of the national Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative.

TI  - The Benefits of Opioid Free Anesthesia and the Precautions Necessary When
      Employing It.
PG  - 152-7
AB  - The use of opioids in the perioperative period is associated with respiratory
      depression, impaired gastrointestinal function, post-operative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV), pruritus, urinary retention, delirium and the potential for
      developing opioid addiction. Currently the United States is experiencing an
      epidemic of prescription opioid abuse and deaths from overdose. Many addicts
      develop their addiction during a routine surgical admission to hospital. More
      people now die from overdose of synthetic prescription opioids than from heroin
      and other street drugs. Public education campaigns teaching family members of
      addicts to reverse opioid induced respiratory depression with naloxone are
      currently underway. Preventing the development of addiction in the first place
      during and after the surgical admission however will be more successful at saving
      lives. Primary prevention of opioid addiction is possible when non-opioid
      analgesic drugs are used. Employing alternative analgesic drugs in the
      peri-operative period that have a lower addiction potential and less respiratory 
      depression has therefore become a matter of great national importance. Many
      powerful non-opioid analgesics are currently available that have more favorable
      side effect profiles and a lower potential for developing addiction. However,
      these medications are currently not used as often in routine clinical practice as
      they should be. Replacing opioids with other analgesics will not only reduce the 
      development of opioid addiction but will also lead to better perioperative
      outcomes and enhanced patient recovery. This article briefly reviews the opioid
      alternatives that can significantly reduce or even entirely eliminate the
      perioperative use of opioids in the majority of surgical procedures.
