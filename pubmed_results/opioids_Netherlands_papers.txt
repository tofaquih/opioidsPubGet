TI  - Impact of EMA regulatory label changes on systemic diclofenac initiation,
      discontinuation, and switching to other pain medicines in Scotland, England,
      Denmark, and The Netherlands.
PG  - 296-305
AB  - Purpose: In June 2013 a European Medicines Agency referral procedure concluded
      that diclofenac was associated with an elevated risk of acute cardiovascular
      events and contraindications, warnings, and changes to the product information
      were implemented across the European Union. This study measured the impact of the
      regulatory action on the prescribing of systemic diclofenac in Denmark, The
      Netherlands, England, and Scotland. Methods: Quarterly time series analyses
      measuring diclofenac prescription initiation, discontinuation and switching to
      other systemic nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAIDs), topical NSAIDs,
      paracetamol, opioids, and other chronic pain medication in those who discontinued
      diclofenac. Absolute effects were estimated using interrupted time series
      regression. Results: Overall, diclofenac prescription initiations fell during the
      observation periods of all countries. Compared with Denmark where there appeared 
      to be a more limited effect, the regulatory action was associated with
      significant immediate reductions in diclofenac initiation in The Netherlands
      (−0.42%, 95% CI, −0.66% to −0.18%), England (−0.09%, 95% CI, −0.11% to −0.08%),
      and Scotland (−0.67%, 95% CI, −0.79% to −0.55%); and falling trends in diclofenac
      initiation in the Netherlands (−0.03%, 95% CI, −0.06% to −0.01% per quarter) and 
      Scotland (−0.04%, 95% CI, −0.05% to −0.02% per quarter). There was no significant
      impact on diclofenac discontinuation in any country. The regulatory action was
      associated with modest differences in switching to other pain medicines following
      diclofenac discontinuation. Conclusions: The regulatory action was associated
      with significant reductions in overall diclofenac initiation which varied by
      country and type of exposure. There was no impact on discontinuation and variable
      impact on switching.
