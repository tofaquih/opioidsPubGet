TI  - Incidence of Opioid Overdose Among Patients Using ER/LA Opioid Analgesics Before 
      and After Implementation of the Class-Wide Opioid Risk Evaluation and Mitigation 
      Strategy.
PG  - 157-69
AB  - Introduction: The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required 
      a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and
      long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics on 09 July 2012. Methods: This study
      compared the incidence of opioid overdose before (July 2010-June 2012) and after 
      (July 2013-September 2016) the initiation of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
      Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics.
      We identified patients with ≥1 ER/LA opioid dispensing in either time period in
      national data from the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and in
      United States (US) Medicaid claims data from four states. We described each
      population, calculated the incidence rate (IR) of opioid overdose, and assessed
      crude and propensity score adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing the
      overdose rate after vs before implementation of the REMS. Results: A total of
      121,229 commercially insured and 11,488 Medicaid patients were included in the
      analysis. Rates of overdose were substantially higher in Medicaid patients than
      in the commercially insured patients (IR 192.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      162.60–225.18 versus 102.60, 95% CI 93.0–112.93 in the active period). The IRRs
      for opioid overdose were 1.01 (95% CI 0.87–1.17) in the commercially insured
      population and 0.70 (95% CI 0.52–0.93) in Medicaid. Conclusion: This leveling off
      of overdose rates among commercially insured patients and decline among Medicaid 
      patients is encouraging, but it is difficult to disentangle the specific impact
      of the REMS from many other ongoing initiatives with similar goals.

TI  - The Modified WHO Analgesic Ladder: Is It Appropriate for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain?
PG  - 411-7
AB  - Introduction: From 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder has
      been used as the simple and valuable pain-relieving guidance in the
      pharmaceutical pain management, however, with the development of medical history,
      notions about pain physiology and pain management have already updated. Is the
      analgesic ladder still appropriate for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) patients?
      This study aims to analyse the current usage of the analgesic ladder in patients 
      with CNCP by evaluating previously published pertinent studies. Methods:
      Literature published in English from January 1980 to April 2019 and cited on
      PubMed database was included. Analysis on the analgesic ladder, current status of
      CNCP management, and a new revised ladder model were developed based on relevant 
      literature. Results: The WHO analgesic ladder for cancer pain is not appropriate 
      for current CNCP management. It is revised into a four-step ladder: the
      integrative therapies being adopted at each step for reducing or even stopping
      the use of opioid analgesics; interventional therapies being considered as step 3
      before upgrading to strong opioids if non-opioids and weak opioids failed in CNCP
      management. Discussion: A simple and valuable guideline in past years, the WHO
      analgesic ladder is inappropriate for the current use of CNCP control. A revised 
      four-step analgesic ladder aligned with integrative medicine principles and
      minimally invasive interventions is recommended for control of CNCP.

TI  - “My life is under control with these medications”: an interpretative
      phenomenological analysis of managing chronic pain with opioids.
LID - 61
AB  - Background: The use of opioids to relieve chronic pain has increased during the
      last decades, but experiences of chronic opioid therapy (COT) (> 90 days) point
      at risks and loss of beneficial effects. Still, some patients report benefits
      from opioid medication, such as being able to stay at work. Guidelines for opioid
      use in chronic pain do not consider the individual experience of COT, including
      benefits and risks, making the first person perspective an important scientific
      component to explore. The aim of this study was to investigate the lived
      experience of managing chronic pain with opioids in a sample who have severe
      chronic pain but are able to manage their pain sufficiently to remain at work.
      Methods: We used a qualitative research design: interpretative phenomenological
      analysis. Ten individuals with chronic pain and opioid therapy were purposively
      sampled in Swedish tertiary care. Results: Three super-ordinate themes emerged
      from the analyses: Without opioids, the pain becomes the boss; Opioids as a
      salvation and a curse, and Acknowledgement of the pain and acceptance of opioid
      therapy enables transition to a novel self. The participants used opioids to
      regain control over their pain, thus reclaiming their wanted life and self, and
      sense of control over one’s life-world. Using opioids to manage pain was not
      unproblematic and some of the participants had experienced a downward spiral of
      escalating pain and uncontrollable opioid use, and stigmatisation. Conclusions:
      All participants emphasised the importance of control, regarding both pain and
      opioid use. To accomplish this, trust between participants and health care
      providers was essential for satisfactory treatment. Regardless of the potential
      sociocultural benefits of staying at work, participants had experiences of
      balancing positive and negative effects of opioid therapy, similar to what
      previous qualitative research has found.Measurable improvement of function and
      quality of life, may justify the long-term use of opioids in some cases. However,
      monitoring of adverse events should be mandatory. This requires close cooperation
      and a trusting relationship between the patients and their health care provider.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Opioid Cessation.
LID - 180
AB  - The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) and
      overdose-related deaths. However, the genetic basis for the ability to
      discontinue opioid use has not been investigated. We performed a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) of opioid cessation (defined as abstinence from illicit 
      opioids for >1 year or <6 months before the interview date) in 1130 African
      American (AA) and 2919 European ancestry (EA) participants recruited for genetic 
      studies of substance use disorders and who met lifetime Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for OUD.
      Association tests performed separately within each ethnic group were combined by 
      meta-analysis with results obtained from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study.
      Although there were no genome-wide significant associations, we found suggestive 
      associations with nine independent loci, including three which are biologically
      relevant: rs4740988 in PTPRD (pAA + EA = 2.24 × 10−6), rs36098404 in MYOM2 (pEA =
      2.24 × 10−6), and rs592026 in SNAP25-AS1 (pEA = 6.53 × 10−6). Significant
      pathways identified in persons of European ancestry (EA) are related to vitamin D
      metabolism (p = 3.79 × 10−2) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (p =
      2.39 × 10−2). UK Biobank traits including smoking and drinking cessation and
      chronic back pain were significantly associated with opioid cessation using
      GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores. These results provide evidence for genetic
      influences on opioid cessation, suggest genetic overlap with other relevant
      traits, and may indicate potential novel therapeutic targets for OUD.

TI  - Experiences of people taking opioid medication for chronic non-malignant pain: a 
      qualitative evidence synthesis using meta-ethnography.
LID - e032988
AB  - Objective: To review qualitative studies on the experience of taking opioid
      medication for chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) or coming off them. Design: This
      is a qualitative evidence synthesis using a seven-step approach from the methods 
      of meta-ethnography. Data sources and eligibility criteria: We searched selected 
      databases—Medline, Embase, AMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
      Literature, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus (Science Citation Index and
      Social Science Citation Index)—for qualitative studies which provide patients’
      views of taking opioid medication for CNMP or of coming off them (June 2017,
      updated September 2018). Data extraction and synthesis: Papers were quality
      appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool, and the
      GRADE-CERQual (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
      working group - Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research)
      guidelines were applied. We identified concepts and iteratively abstracted these 
      concepts into a line of argument. Results: We screened 2994 unique citations and 
      checked 153 full texts, and 31 met our review criteria. We identified five
      themes: (1) reluctant users with little choice; (2) understanding opioids: the
      good and the bad; (3) a therapeutic alliance: not always on the same page; (4)
      stigma: feeling scared and secretive but needing support; and (5) the challenge
      of tapering or withdrawal. A new overarching theme of ‘constantly balancing’
      emerged from the data. Conclusions: People taking opioids were constantly
      balancing tensions, not always wanting to take opioids, and weighing the pros and
      cons of opioids but feeling they had no choice because of the pain. They
      frequently felt stigmatised, were not always ‘on the same page’ as their
      healthcare professional and felt changes in opioid use were often challenging.

TI  - Opioid-induced immunosuppression and carcinogenesis promotion theories create the
      newest trend in acute and chronic pain pharmacotherapy.
LID - e1554
AB  - Opioids are the main group of pharmacological agents used during the
      perioperative period and provide a sedative and analgesic component. The
      observations of opioid consumption in West Europe indicate that this group of
      drugs is widely used in chronic noncancer pain therapy.Nearly 20 years ago, the
      first publications indicating that opioids, as an element of perioperative
      pharmacotherapy in oncologic patients, increase the risk of tumor recurrence and 
      affect further prognosis were presented. The actual publications suggest that
      there are multifactorial, complex mechanisms underlying the immunological impact 
      and carcinogenesis promotion of opioids and that the intensity varies depending
      on the type of opioid. There are also questions about the immunosuppressive
      effects among patients receiving opioids in the treatment of chronic noncancer
      pain.The aim of the review article is to present information about the action of 
      opioids on the immune system in carcinogenic settings and to define the clinical 
      usefulness of this pharmacological phenomenon.

AB  - Question: Have emergency department clinicians responded to the opioid epidemic
      through altering opioid prescription rates? Findings: In this cross-sectional
      study of 556 176 emergency department patient encounters and 70 218 opioid
      prescriptions within a single emergency department, yearly prescriptions
      decreased by 66.3% between 2013 and 2018. This decrease was associated with a
      71.1% reduction in the number of opioid prescriptions for musculoskeletal pain
      (back, limb, joint, and neck pain) and lesser, but still marked, decreases for
      fractures and kidney stones. Meaning: Reductions in yearly opioid prescriptions
      across varying indications appear to be aligned with recognition of the opioid
      crisis in addition to national, state, and departmental education guidelines.

TI  - Association of Formulary Exclusions and Restrictions for Opioid Alternatives With
      Opioid Prescribing Among Medicare Beneficiaries.
LID - e200274
AB  - Question: Are Medicare Part D formulary exclusions and restrictions for opioid
      alternatives associated with increases in opioid prescribing? Findings: Using
      county-level panel data throughout the United States, it was found that for each 
      additional opioid alternative not covered in a county, the rate of opioid
      prescribing increased by 2.2% to 3.7% relative to the mean opioid prescribing
      rate. Formulary restrictions in the form of utilization management strategies and
      high-cost tier placements for opioid alternatives were not associated with
      increases in opioid prescribing. Meaning: The findings of this study suggest that
      lack of coverage of opioid alternatives may encourage higher rates of opioid
      prescribing.

TI  - Knowledge, attitudes and practices of Canadian pediatric emergency physicians
      regarding short-term opioid use: a descriptive, cross-sectional survey.
PG  - E148-55
AB  - Background:: In the midst of the current opioid crisis, physicians are caught
      between balancing children’s optimal pain management and the risks of opioid
      therapy. This study describes pediatric emergency physicians’ practice patterns
      for prescribing, knowledge and attitudes regarding, and perceived barriers to and
      facilitators of short-term use of opioids. Methods:: We created a survey tool
      using published methodology guidelines and distributed it from October to
      December 2017 to all physicians in the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada
      database using Dillman’s tailored design method for mixed-mode surveys. We
      performed bivariable binomial logistic regressions to ascertain the effects of
      clinically significant variables (e.g., training, age, sex, degree of worry
      regarding severe adverse events) on use of opioids as a first-line treatment for 
      moderate pain in the emergency department, and prescription of opioids for
      moderate or severe pain for at-home use in children. Results:: Of the 224
      physicians in the database, 136 (60.7%) completed the survey (60/111 [54.1%]
      women; median age 44 yr). Of the 136, 74 (54.4%) had subspecialty training.
      Intranasally administered fentanyl was the most commonly selected opioid for
      first-line treatment of moderate (47 respondents [34.6%]) and severe (82 [60.3%])
      pain due to musculoskeletal injury. On a scale of 0 (not worried) to 100
      (extremely worried), physicians’ median score for worry regarding physical
      dependence was 6.0 (25th percentile 0.0, 75th percentile 16.0), for worry
      regarding addiction 10.0 (25th percentile 2.0, 75th percentile 20.0) and for
      worry regarding diversion of opioids 24.5 (25th percentile 14.0, 75th percentile 
      52.0). On a scale of 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely), the median score for
      influence of the opioid crisis on willingness to prescribe opioids was 22.0 (25th
      percentile 8.0, 75th percentile 49.0). The top 3 reported barriers to prescribing
      opioids were parental reluctance (57 [41.9%]), lack of clear guidelines for
      pediatric opioid use (35 [25.7%]) and concern about adverse effects (33 [24.3%]).
      Binomial logistic regression did not identify any statistically significant
      variables affecting use of opioids in the emergency department or prescribed for 
      use at home. Interpretation:: Emergency department physicians appeared minimally 
      concerned about physical dependence, addiction risk and the current opioid crisis
      when prescribing opioids to children. Evidence-based development of guidelines
      and protocols for use of opioids in children may improve physicians’ ability to
      manage pain in children responsibly and adequately.

TI  - Socioeconomic risk factors for fatal opioid overdoses in the United States:
      Findings from the Mortality Disparities in American Communities Study (MDAC).
LID - e0227966
AB  - Background: Understanding relationships between individual-level demographic,
      socioeconomic status (SES) and U.S. opioid fatalities can inform interventions in
      response to this crisis. Methods: The Mortality Disparities in American Community
      Study (MDAC) links nearly 4 million 2008 American Community Survey responses to
      the 2008–2015 National Death Index. Univariate and multivariable models were used
      to estimate opioid overdose fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). Results: Opioid overdose was an overrepresented cause of death
      among people 10 to 59 years of age. In multivariable analysis, compared to
      Hispanics, Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives had elevated risk (HR =
      2.52, CI:2.21–2.88) and (HR = 1.88, CI:1.35–2.62), respectively. Compared to
      women, men were at-risk (HR = 1.61, CI:1.50–1.72). People who were disabled were 
      at higher risk than those who were not (HR = 2.80, CI:2.59–3.03). Risk was higher
      among widowed than married (HR = 2.44, CI:2.03–2.95) and unemployed than employed
      individuals (HR = 2.46, CI:2.17–2.79). Compared to adults with graduate degrees, 
      those with high school only were at-risk (HR = 2.48, CI:2.00–3.06). Citizens were
      more likely than noncitizens to die from this cause (HR = 4.62, CI:3.48–6.14).
      Compared to people who owned homes with mortgages, those who rented had higher
      HRs (HR = 1.36, CI:1.25–1.48). Non-rural residents had higher risk than rural
      residents (HR = 1.46, CI:1.34, 1.59). Compared to respective referent groups,
      people without health insurance (HR = 1.30, CI:1.20–1.41) and people who were
      incarcerated were more likely to die from opioid overdoses (HR = 2.70,
      CI:1.91–3.81). Compared to people living in households at least five-times above 
      the poverty line, people who lived in poverty were more likely to die from this
      cause (HR = 1.36, CI:1.20–1.54). Compared to people living in West North Central 
      states, HRs were highest among those in South Atlantic (HR = 1.29, CI:1.11, 1.50)
      and Mountain states (HR = 1.58, CI:1.33, 1.88). Discussion: Opioid fatality was
      associated with indicators of low SES. The findings may help to target
      prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts to vulnerable groups.

TI  - G protein‐biased kratom‐alkaloids and synthetic carfentanil‐amide opioids as
      potential treatments for alcohol use disorder.
PG  - 1497-513
AB  - Background and Purpose: Mitragyna speciosa, more commonly known as kratom, is a
      plant that contains opioidergic alkaloids but is unregulated in most countries.
      Kratom is used in the self‐medication of chronic pain and to reduce illicit and
      prescription opioid dependence. Kratom may be less dangerous than typical opioids
      because of the stronger preference of kratom alkaloids to induce receptor
      interaction with G proteins over β‐arrestin proteins. We hypothesized that kratom
      (alkaloids) can also reduce alcohol intake. Experimental Approach: We
      pharmacologically characterized kratom extracts, kratom alkaloids (mitragynine,
      7‐hydroxymitragynine, paynantheine, and speciogynine) and synthetic
      carfentanil‐amide opioids for their ability to interact with G proteins and
      β‐arrestin at μ, δ, and κ opioid receptors in vitro. We used C57BL/6 mice to
      assess to which degree these opioids could reduce alcohol intake and whether they
      had rewarding properties. Key Results: Kratom alkaloids were strongly G
      protein‐biased at all three opioid receptors and reduced alcohol intake, but
      kratom and 7‐hydroxymitragynine were rewarding. Several results indicated a key
      role for δ opioid receptors, including that the synthetic carfentanil‐amide
      opioid MP102—a G protein‐biased agonist with modest selectivity for δ opioid
      receptors—reduced alcohol intake, whereas the G protein‐biased μ opioid agonist
      TRV130 did not. Conclusion and Implications: Our results suggest that kratom
      extracts can decrease alcohol intake but still carry significant risk upon
      prolonged use. Development of more δ opioid‐selective synthetic opioids may
      provide a safer option than kratom to treat alcohol use disorder with fewer side 
      effects.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Initiation of Strong Opioids in Cancer Patients on
      Palliative Care: An Audit from a Tertiary Cancer Center in India.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - Aim:: This audit was done to analyze the factors influencing the use of strong
      opioids in cancer patients receiving comprehensive palliative care from a
      tertiary institute. Materials and Methods:: Case records of patients registered
      for palliative care at our center in 3 months were retrospectively reviewed and
      followed up throughout the course of their illness. Demographic factors, prior
      treatments, social support system, analgesic use at registration, and use of
      radiation and adjuvant analgesics were recorded. Strong opioid use and their time
      of initiation were evaluated, and multivariate analysis was used to identify the 
      factors correlating with the above. Results:: After registration, strong opioids 
      were initiated in 16% of the patients. It was observed that patients younger than
      55 years and those with visceral metastases and history of use of weak opioids at
      the time of registration had a higher probability of being started on strong
      opioids. Factors associated with a significantly longer strong opioid-free
      interval were having spouse as primary caregiver, presence of skeletal
      metastases, use of palliative radiotherapy, and low socioeconomic status.
      Conclusion:: It is certain that the use of strong opioids for adequate analgesia 
      is a necessity for palliative-care patients. However, optimal utilization of
      adjunctive analgesic modalities, coupled with good supportive care, can minimize 
      the requirement and duration of strong opioid use, especially in developing
      countries with limited access to specialist palliative care.

TI  - Risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations: a qualitative study of the perspectives of Australian general
      practitioners.
LID - e034363
AB  - Objective: To explore the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) concerning 
      the risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations. Design: A qualitative approach using semistructured telephone
      interviews. Analysis used an integrative approach. Setting: Primary care.
      Participants: Australian GPs with experience of prescribing opioids for people
      with cancer and pain. Results: Twenty-two GPs participated, and three themes
      emerged. Theme 1 (Misuse is not the main problem) contextualised misuse as a
      relatively minor concern compared with pain control and toxicity, and highlighted
      underlying systemic factors, including limitations in continuity of care and
      doctor expertise. Theme 2 (‘A different mindset’ for cancer pain) captured
      participants’ relative comfort in prescribing opioids for pain in cancer versus
      non-cancer contexts, and acknowledgement that compassion and greater perceived
      community acceptance were driving factors, in addition to scientific support for 
      mechanisms and clinical efficacy. Participant attitudes towards prescribing for
      people with cancer versus non-cancer pain differed most when cancer was in the
      palliative phase, when they were unconcerned by misuse. Participants were
      equivocal about the risk–benefit ratio of long-term opioid therapy in the chronic
      phase of cancer, and were reluctant to prescribe for disease-free survivors.
      Theme 3 (‘The question is always, ‘how lazy have you been?’) captured
      participants’ acknowledgement that they sometimes prescribed opioids for cancer
      pain as a default, easier option compared with more holistic pain management.
      Conclusions: Findings highlight the role of specific clinical considerations in
      distinguishing risk of opioid misuse in the cancer versus non-cancer population, 
      rather than diagnosis per se. Further efforts are needed to ensure continuity of 
      care where opioid prescribing is shared. Greater evidence is needed to guide
      opioid prescribing in disease-free survivors and the chronic phase of cancer,
      especially in the context of new treatments for metastatic disease.

TI  - The opioid mortality epidemic in North America: do we understand the supply side 
      dynamics of this unprecedented crisis?
LID - 14
AB  - While there has been extensive attention to the ‘demand side’ – or use and
      adverse consequences, including mortality – of the ‘opioid crisis’ presently
      unfolding across North America, few considerations have focused on the supply
      side. This paper examines the supply side dynamics of this unprecedented public
      health phenomenon. We provide evidence for several interrelated supply-side
      elements that have contributed to the present public health crisis. We observe
      that initially, persistently high levels of prescription opioid availability and 
      use exposed large proportions of the North American population to opioids,
      resulting in correspondingly high levels of medical and non-medical use (e.g.,
      involving diversion). While various intervention measures to control prescription
      opioid availability and use have been implemented in recent years, leading to
      eventual reductions in opioid dispensing levels, these occurred late in the
      crisis’s evolution. Moreover, these supply reductions have not been met by
      corresponding reductions in opioid use or demand levels. These growing
      discrepancies between opioid demand and prescription-based sources have left
      major gaps in opioid supplies. In response to such supply gaps, highly potent and
      toxic illicit opioid products have rapidly proliferated across North America, and
      become a core driver of the dramatic spikes in opioid overdose fatality levels in
      recent years. These supply-related interrelations are corroborated by a
      corresponding increase in illicit opioid-related fatalities, which arose just as 
      medical opioid supplies began to decrease in many jurisdictions. Improved
      analyses and understanding of the supply-side dynamics of the opioid crisis are
      urgently needed in order to inform future intervention and policy development.
      Meanwhile, the high mortality toll related to illicit, highly toxic opioid
      exposure requires sustained solutions, including supply-oriented measures (e.g., 
      safer opioid distribution for at–risk users) towards improved public health
      protection.

TI  - Women’s Perspectives On Provider Education Regarding Opioid Use.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - Objective: To elucidate women’s experiences with opioid medications and their
      perspectives on provider education regarding opioid use, risks and safety.
      Methods: Women with a self-reported history of pain who had been prescribed
      opioids were recruited in 2016 using a convenience sampling approach that
      included an online social media campaign. Participants (N=154) completed online
      surveys and open-ended questions regarding their experiences with pain and
      opioids, and their perspectives on the quality of education they received from
      their providers. Results: Participants reported receiving insufficient education 
      about opioid-related side effects, as reflected in both ratings for the quantity 
      and quality of education they received from their providers. Non-white
      participants reported lower quantity and poorer quality of provider education
      (p<0.05). Themes identified from the qualitative data included frustrations with 
      pain management options, fear of opioids, stigma associated with opioid use, and 
      the need for improved provider education and patient-provider communication.
      Conclusion: Findings suggest that from a patient’s perspective, there is a need
      for enhanced patient-provider communication and education regarding pain
      management and potential opioid-related side effects. Improved physician
      communication and education could promote shared decision-making and result in
      enhanced satisfaction with care and health outcomes.

TI  - Opioids depress breathing through two small brainstem sites.
LID - e52694
AB  - The rates of opioid overdose in the United States quadrupled between 1999 and
      2017, reaching a staggering 130 deaths per day. This health epidemic demands
      innovative solutions that require uncovering the key brain areas and cell types
      mediating the cause of overdose— opioid-induced respiratory depression. Here, we 
      identify two primary changes to murine breathing after administering opioids.
      These changes implicate the brainstem’s breathing circuitry which we confirm by
      locally eliminating the µ-Opioid receptor. We find the critical brain site is the
      preBötzinger Complex, where the breathing rhythm originates, and use genetic
      tools to reveal that just 70–140 neurons in this region are responsible for its
      sensitivity to opioids. Future characterization of these neurons may lead to
      novel therapies that prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.

TI  - Investigating opioid-related fatalities in southern Sweden: contact with
      care-providing authorities and comparison of substances.
LID - 5
AB  - Background: Opioid-related deaths have increased in Western countries over recent
      decades. Despite numerous studies investigating opioid-related mortality, only a 
      few have focused on the lives of the deceased individuals prior to their deaths, 
      specifically regarding contact with care-providing authorities such as health,
      social and correctional services. Furthermore, a change has been noted in the
      last two decades as to which opioids cause most deaths, from heroin to
      prescription opioids. However, studies comparing fatalities caused by different
      substances are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate contact with
      care-providing authorities during the year prior to death among individuals who
      died as a result of opioid intoxication and to analyse differences relating to
      which opioids caused their deaths. Methods: The study is based on retrospective
      register data and includes 180 individuals with a history of illicit drug use,
      who died from opioid intoxication in Skåne, Sweden, between 1 January 2012 to 31 
      December 2013 and 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. Intoxications caused by heroin,
      methadone, buprenorphine and fentanyl were included. Data were collected from the
      National Board of Forensic Medicine, regional health care services, municipal
      social services and the Prison and Probation Service. Statistical testing was
      performed using Pearson’s chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test and the
      Mann-Whitney U test to analyse group differences. Results: A total of 89% of the 
      deceased individuals had been in contact with one or more of the care-providing
      authorities during the year prior to death; 75% had been in contact with health
      care, 69% with the social services, 28% with the Prison and Probation Service,
      and 23% had been enrolled in opioid substitution treatment at some point during
      their final year of life. Few differences appeared between the substance groups
      with regard to which opioid contributed to the death. In addition to opioids,
      sedatives were present in more than 80% of the cases. Individuals whose deaths
      were buprenorphine-related had been in contact with the social services to a
      significantly lesser extent during the year prior to death. Conclusions: The
      studied population is characterised by extensive contact with care-providing
      authorities, thus providing numerous opportunities for authorities to reach this 
      group with preventive and other interventions. Few differences emerged between
      groups with regard to which opioid had contributed to the death.

TI  - The Complex Balance between Analgesic Efficacy, Change of Dose and Safety Profile
      Over Time, in Cancer Patients Treated with Opioids: Providing the Clinicians with
      an Evaluation Tool.
LID - 502
AB  - Background: Scanty data exist on the integration between the analgesic effect of 
      opioids, dose changes, and adverse events in cancer patients. Methods: To provide
      further information on this issue, we analysed data on 498 advanced-stage cancer 
      patients treated with strong opioids. At baseline and three visits (at days 7,
      14, and 21), pain intensity, oral morphine-equivalent daily dose, and the
      prevalence of major adverse events were measured. The proportion of responders
      (pain intensity decrease ≥30% from baseline) and non-responders, as well as of
      patients with low or high dose escalation, was calculated. Results: Pain
      intensity strongly decreased from baseline (pain intensity difference −4.0 at day
      7 and −4.2 at day 21) in responders, while it was quite stable in non-responders 
      (pain intensity difference −0.8 at day 7 and −0.9 at day 21). In low dose
      escalation patients (82.4% at final visit), daily dose changed from 52.3 to 65.3 
      mg; in high dose escalation patients (17.6%), it varied from 94.1 to 146.7 mg.
      Among responders, high dose escalation patients experienced significantly more
      frequent adverse events compared to low or high dose escalation patients, while
      no differences were observed in non-responders. Conclusions: The response to
      opioids results from the combination of three clinical aspects, which are
      strongly interrelated. These results provide some thoughts to help clinical
      evaluations and therapeutic decisions regarding opioid use.

TI  - Evaluating kratom alkaloids using PHASE.
LID - e0229646
AB  - Kratom is a botanical substance that is marketed and promoted in the US for
      pharmaceutical opioid indications despite having no US Food and Drug
      Administration approved uses. Kratom contains over forty alkaloids including two 
      partial agonists at the mu opioid receptor, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine,
      that have been subjected to the FDA’s scientific and medical evaluation. However,
      pharmacological and toxicological data for the remaining alkaloids are limited.
      Therefore, we applied the Public Health Assessment via Structural Evaluation
      (PHASE) protocol to generate in silico binding profiles for 25 kratom alkaloids
      to facilitate the risk evaluation of kratom. PHASE demonstrates that kratom
      alkaloids share structural features with controlled opioids, indicates that
      several alkaloids bind to the opioid, adrenergic, and serotonin receptors, and
      suggests that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are the strongest binders at
      the mu opioid receptor. Subsequently, the in silico binding profiles of a subset 
      of the alkaloids were experimentally verified at the opioid, adrenergic, and
      serotonin receptors using radioligand binding assays. The verified binding
      profiles demonstrate the ability of PHASE to identify potential safety signals
      and provide a tool for prioritizing experimental evaluation of high-risk
      compounds.

      observations of past opioid prescription accurately predict adverse
      opioid-related outcomes among Medicaid recipients even before their initial
      opioid prescription is written. Although these models are limited to individuals 
      who have been selected for opioid prescription, they suggest a feasible path
      forward for using administrative data to inform prescription risk. Under the
      assumption that the cost of diverting individuals from opioid therapy to an
      alternative therapy is homogenous across individuals, we simulate a hypothetical 
      policy for restricting opioid prescriptions based on risk that is likely
      net-beneficial given current cost estimates.

TI  - Computed tomography-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection for refractory
      pain in patients with spinal metastases: Two case reports.
LID - e18939
AB  - Rationale:: Diagnosing and treating refractory cancer pain have become
      standardized and effective procedures with guidance from the Expert Consensus on 
      Refractory Cancer Pain released in 2017 by the Committee of Rehabilitation and
      Palliative Care of China. Doxorubicin has been used for perineural injection in
      the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain owing to its retrograde sensory ganglion
      resection effect. Our study reports a new fourth-ladder treatment for cancer
      pain: CT-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection for patients with refractory 
      cancer pain caused by paraspinal metastasis. Patient concerns:: A 48-year-old
      female and a 47-year-old male patients suffered from refractory cancer pain over 
      the past months. They had both undergone surgical tumor resection, chemotherapy, 
      and precision radiotherapy but result in limited analgesic effect. The daily oral
      morphine dosage was around 60 to 100 mg and rescue analgesic methods had been
      used at the time. Diagnoses:: Refractory cancer pain in 2 patients with renal
      cancer and hepatobiliary adenocarcinoma. Interventions:: The patients both
      received computed tomography (CT)-guided 1 mL of 0.5% doxorubicin paravertebral
      injection at each affected nerve root segments. Outcomes:: The Visual Analog
      Scale and Douleur Neuropathique four Questions were used for 6-month follow-up,
      and the analgesic requirement was also recorded. The patients enjoyed
      satisfactory analgesia for up to 6 months without adverse reaction. In addition, 
      the oral opioid analgesic doses were significantly reduced after the neurolytic
      block. Lessons:: The CT-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection was an
      effective fourth-step analgesic interventional technology that allowed our 2
      patients with refractory cancer pain to maintain satisfactory analgesia. This
      analgesia method taken at an appropriate stage, according to the latest analgesic
      concept, results in good analgesia and opioid use reduction. Also, with the
      imaging guidance, only a small amount of neurolytic agent is needed to achieve
      analgesia in a precise and safe way.

TI  - Social media as an emerging tool for reducing prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors.
LID - e03471
AB  - Interventions are urgently needed to reduce prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors, including anxiety and concomitant use of sedatives. However, only a
      limited number of randomized controlled opioid intervention trials have been
      conducted. We sought to determine whether an online behavior change/support
      community, compared to a control Facebook group, could reduce anxiety and opioid 
      misuse among chronic pain patients. 51 high-risk non-cancer chronic pain patients
      were randomly assigned to either a Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE)
      peer-led online behavior change intervention or a control group (no peer leaders)
      on Facebook for 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria were: 18 years or older, a UCLA
      Health System patient, prescribed an opioid for non-cancer chronic pain between 3
      and 12 months ago, and a score of ≥9 on the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) 
      and/or concomitant use of benzodiazepines. Participation in the online community 
      was voluntary. Patients completed baseline and follow-up assessments on
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder screener (GAD-7), COMM, and frequency of social
      media discussions about pain and opioid use. Compared to control group
      participants, intervention participants showed a baseline-to-follow-up decrease
      in anxiety, and more frequently used social media to discuss pain, prescription
      opioid use, coping strategies, places to seek help, and alternative therapies for
      pain. Both groups showed a baseline to follow-up decrease in COMM score.
      Preliminary results support the use an online community interventions as a
      low-cost tool to decrease risk for prescription opioid misuse and its
      complications.

TI  - Developing a clinical decision support for opioid use disorders: a NIDA center
      for the clinical trials network working group report.
LID - 4
AB  - There is an urgent need for strategies to address the US epidemic of prescription
      opioid, heroin and fentanyl-related overdoses, misuse, addiction, and diversion. 
      Evidence-based treatment such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are
      available but lack numbers of providers offering these services to meet the
      demands. Availability of electronic health record (EHR) systems has greatly
      increased and led to innovative quality improvement initiatives but this has not 
      yet been optimized to address the opioid epidemic or to treat opioid use disorder
      (OUD). This report from a clinical decision support (CDS) working group convened 
      by the NIDA Center for the Clinical Trials Network aims to converge electronic
      technology in the EHR with the urgent need to improve screening, identification, 
      and treatment of OUD in primary care settings through the development of a CDS
      algorithm that could be implemented as a tool in the EHR. This aim is consistent 
      with federal, state and local government and private sector efforts to improve
      access and quality of MOUD treatment for OUD, existing clinical quality and HEDIS
      measures for OUD or drug and alcohol use disorders, and with a recent draft grade
      B recommendation from the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) for
      screening for illicit drug use in adults when appropriate diagnosis, treatment
      and care services can be offered or referred. Through a face-to-face expert panel
      meeting and multiple follow-up conference calls, the working group drafted CDS
      algorithms for clinical care felt to be essential for screening, diagnosis, and
      management of OUD in primary care. The CDS algorithm was reviewed by addiction
      specialists and primary care providers and revised based on their input. A
      clinical decision support tool for OUD screening, assessment, and treatment
      within primary care systems may help improve healthcare delivery to help address 
      the current epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose that has outpaced the capacity
      of specialized treatment settings. A semi-structured outline of clinical decision
      support for OUD was developed to facilitate implementation within the EHR.
      Further work for adaptation at specific sites and for testing is needed.

TI  - Cannabinoids as an Alternative Option for Conventional Analgesics in Cancer Pain 
      Management: A Pharmacogenomics Perspective.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - The global cancer burden is significantly increasing at an alarming rate
      affecting patients, relatives, communities, and health-care system. Cancer
      patients require adequate pain relief and palliative care throughout the life
      course, especially in terminal illness. Although opioid treatment is successful
      in majority of patients, around 40% do not achieve enough analgesia or are prone 
      to serious side effects and toxicity. The treatment of medical conditions with
      cannabis and cannabinoid compounds is constantly expanding. This review organizes
      the current knowledge in the context of SNPs associated with opioids and
      nonopioids and its clinical consequences in pain management and pharmacogenetic
      targets of cannabinoids, for use in clinical practice.

TI  - Canadian Guidelines on Opioid Use Disorder Among Older Adults.
PG  - 123-34
AB  - Background: In Canada, rates of hospital admission from opioid overdose are
      higher for older adults (≥ 65) than younger adults, and opioid use disorder (OUD)
      is a growing concern. In response, Health Canada commissioned the Canadian
      Coalition of Seniors’ Mental Health to create guidelines for the prevention,
      screening, assessment, and treatment of OUD in older adults. Methods: A
      systematic review of English language literature from 2008–2018 regarding OUD in 
      adults was conducted. Previously published guidelines were evaluated using AGREE 
      II, and key guidelines updated using ADAPTE method, by drawing on current
      literature. Recommendations were created and assessed using the GRADE method.
      Results: Thirty-two recommendations were created. Prevention recommendations: it 
      is key to prioritize non-pharmacological and non-opioid strategies to treat acute
      and chronic noncancer pain. Assessment recommendations: a comprehensive
      assessment is important to help discern contributions of other medical
      conditions. Treatment recommendations: buprenorphine is first line for both
      withdrawal management and maintenance therapy, while methadone, slow-release oral
      morphine, or naltrexone can be used as alternatives under certain circumstances; 
      non-pharmacological treatments should be offered as an integrated part of care.
      Conclusion: These guidelines provide practical and timely clinical
      recommendations on the prevention, assessment, and treatment of OUD in older
      adults within the Canadian context.

TI  - Drivers of the opioid crisis: An appraisal of financial conflicts of interest in 
      clinical practice guideline panels at the peak of opioid prescribing.
LID - e0227045
AB  - Background: Starting in the late 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry sought to
      increase prescribing of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Influencing the
      content of clinical practice guidelines may have been one strategy industry
      employed. In this study we assessed potential risk of bias from financial
      conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry in guidelines for opioid
      prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain published between 2007 and 2013, the peak
      of opioid prescribing. Methods: We used the Guideline Panel Review (GPR) to
      appraise the guidelines included in the 2014 systematic review and critical
      appraisal by Nuckols et al. These were English language opioid prescribing
      guidelines for adults with chronic non-cancer pain published between July 2007
      and July 2013, the peak of opioid prescribing. The GPR assigns red flags to items
      known to introduce potential bias from financial conflicts of interest. We
      operationalized the GPR by creating specific definitions for each red flag. Two
      reviewers independently evaluated each guideline. Disagreements were resolved
      with discussion. We also compared our score to the critical appraisal scores for 
      overall quality from the study by Nuckols et al. Results: We appraised 13
      guidelines, which received 43 red flags in total. Guidelines had 3.3 red flags on
      average (out of a possible seven) with range from one to six. Four guidelines had
      missing information, so red flags may be higher than reported. The guidelines
      with the highest and second highest scores for overall quality in the 2014
      critical appraisal by Nuckols et al. had five and three red flags, respectively. 
      Conclusion: Our findings reveal that the guidelines for opioid prescribing
      chronic non-cancer pain from 2007 to 2013 were at risk of bias because of
      pervasive conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry and a paucity of
      mechanisms to address bias. Even highly-rated guidelines examined in a 2014
      systematic review and critical appraisal had many red flags.

TI  - Bidirectional Regulation of Opioid and Chemokine Function.
LID - 94
AB  - The opioid family of GPCRs consists of the classical opioid receptors, designated
      μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors, and the orphanin-FQ receptor, and these proteins 
      are expressed on both neuronal and hematopoietic cells. A number of laboratories 
      have reported that an important degree of cross-talk can occur between the opioid
      receptors and the chemokine and chemokine receptor families. As a part of this,
      the opioid receptors are known to regulate the expression of certain chemokines
      and chemokine receptors, including those that possess strong pro-inflammatory
      activity. At the level of receptor function, it is clear that certain members of 
      the chemokine family can mediate cross-desensitization of the opioid receptors.
      Conversely, the opioid receptors are all able to induce heterologous
      desensitization of some of the chemokine receptors. Consequently, activation of
      one or more of the opioid receptors can selectively cross-desensitize chemokine
      receptors and regulate chemokine function. These cross-talk processes have
      significant implications for the inflammatory response, since the regulation of
      both the recruitment of inflammatory cells, as well as the sensation of pain, can
      be controlled in this way.

LID - 467
AB  - In light of growing concerns about opioid analgesics, developing new
      non-pharmacologic pain control techniques has become a high priority. Adjunctive 
      virtual reality can help reduce acute pain during painful medical procedures.
      However, for some especially painful medical procedures such as burn wound
      cleaning, clinical researchers recommend that more distracting versions of
      virtual reality are needed, to further amplify the potency of virtual reality
      analgesia. The current study with healthy volunteers explores for the first time 
      whether interacting with virtual objects in Virtual Reality (VR) via “hands free”
      eye-tracking technology integrated into the VR helmet makes VR more
      effective/powerful than non-interactive/passive VR (no eye-tracking) for reducing
      pain during brief thermal pain stimuli.Method: Forty eight healthy volunteers
      participated in the main study. Using a within-subject design, each participant
      received one brief thermal pain stimulus during interactive eye tracked virtual
      reality, and each participant received another thermal pain stimulus during
      non-interactive VR (treatment order randomized). After each pain stimulus,
      participants provided subjective 0–10 ratings of cognitive, sensory and affective
      components of pain, and rated the amount of fun they had during the pain
      stimulus. Results: As predicted, interactive eye tracking increased the analgesic
      effectiveness of immersive virtual reality. Compared to the passive
      non-interactive VR condition, during the interactive eye tracked VR condition,
      participants reported significant reductions in worst pain (p < 0.001) and pain
      unpleasantness (p < 0.001). Participants reported a significantly stronger
      illusion of presence (p < 0.001), and significantly more fun in VR (p < 0.001)
      during the interactive condition compared to during passive VR. In summary, as
      predicted by our primary hypothesis, in the current laboratory acute pain analog 
      study with healthy volunteers, increasing the immersiveness of the VR system via 
      interactive eye tracking significantly increased how effectively VR reduced worst
      pain during a brief thermal pain stimulus. Although attention was not directly
      measured, the pattern of pain ratings, presence ratings, and fun ratings are
      consistent with an attentional mechanism for how VR reduces pain. Whether the
      current results generalize to clinical patient populations is another important
      topic for future research. Additional research and development is recommended.

TI  - Chronic Non-cancer Pain Management and Addiction: A Review.
LID - e6963
AB  - The use of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) has been a fast-rising
      treatment phenomenon in the last two decades. Though opioids are advocated in
      various chronic pain management guidelines, their use in chronic non-cancer pain 
      still remains controversial as evidence of this approach is still weak. This
      paper highlights potential adverse effects associated with opioid use in pain
      management, including an increase in tolerance, dependence, and addiction
      outcomes. Nonetheless, opioids have an important place in contemporary CNCP
      management for selected patients. However, pain management must involve regular
      monitoring and the use of a multimodal pain management strategy. It is essential 
      that the treating physician must be up-to-date with the form of therapy so that
      they have the requisite confidence to prescribe opioids and effectively manage
      adverse effects. Moreover, the adverse effects should be treated promptly to
      enhance patient compliance. Since this approach is beneficial for some patients, 
      opioid treatment should only be applied on a case by case basis.

AB  - So far, opioids have been successfully used to reduce cancer pain in patients in 
      order to improve their quality of life. However, the use of opioids leads to
      numerous side effects such as constipation, drowsiness, nausea, itching,
      increased sweating and hormonal changes. In this review, we described the action 
      of opioids in several molecular pathways significant for maintenance of the
      intestinal homeostasis including the impact on the intestinal epithelium
      integrity, changes in microbiome composition, modulation of the immune system or 
      induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. We summed up the role of
      individual opioids in the processes involved in the growth and development of
      cancer and elucidated if targeting opioid receptors may constitute novel
      therapeutic option in colon cancer.

      receptors in living cells.
LID - e54208
AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through allostery, and it is
      increasingly clear that chemically distinct agonists can produce different
      receptor-based effects. It has been proposed that agonists selectively promote
      receptors to recruit one cellular interacting partner over another, introducing
      allosteric ‘bias’ into the signaling system. However, the underlying hypothesis -
      that different agonists drive GPCRs to engage different cytoplasmic proteins in
      living cells - remains untested due to the complexity of readouts through which
      receptor-proximal interactions are typically inferred. We describe a cell-based
      assay to overcome this challenge, based on GPCR-interacting biosensors that are
      disconnected from endogenous transduction mechanisms. Focusing on opioid
      receptors, we directly demonstrate differences between biosensor recruitment
      produced by chemically distinct opioid ligands in living cells. We then show that
      selective recruitment applies to GRK2, a biologically relevant GPCR regulator,
      through discrete interactions of GRK2 with receptors or with G protein beta-gamma
      subunits which are differentially promoted by agonists.

TI  - Safety, Tolerability, and Effect on Opioid Use of Meloxicam IV Following
      Orthopedic Surgery.
PG  - 221-9
AB  - Objective: A Phase 3 randomized multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial (NCT02720692) compared once-daily intravenous (IV) meloxicam 30 mg to
      placebo, when added to the standard of care pain management regimens, in adults
      with moderate-to-severe pain following major elective surgery and concluded that 
      meloxicam IV had a safety profile similar to placebo and reduced opioid
      consumption. Methods: In this post hoc subgroup analysis of orthopedic surgery
      subjects, 379 subjects received meloxicam IV 30 mg or IV-administered placebo
      every 24 hrs for ≤7 doses. Safety was assessed via AEs, laboratory tests, vital
      signs, and ECG, with an emphasis on specific AEs, including injection site
      reactions, bleeding, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, thrombotic, and wound
      healing events. Daily opioid consumption was assessed during treatment. Results: 
      Among meloxicam IV-treated subjects, 64.7% experienced ≥1 AE versus 68.8% of
      placebo-treated subjects. Investigators assessed most AEs to be mild or moderate 
      in intensity and unrelated to treatment. Total opioid consumption (36.8 mg versus
      50.3 mg IV morphine equivalent dose; P=0.0081) and opioid consumption during time
      points 0‒24, 24‒48, 0‒48, and 0‒72 hrs were statistically significantly lower in 
      the meloxicam IV group. Conclusion: Meloxicam IV demonstrated no significant
      differences in the number and frequency of AEs versus placebo in subjects
      following orthopedic surgery. Opioid consumption was reduced in the meloxicam IV 
      group versus placebo. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier:
      NCT02720692).

TI  - A Review of Scientific Evidence for THC:CBD Oromucosal Spray (Nabiximols) in the 
      Management of Chronic Pain.
PG  - 399-410
AB  - The 20% prevalence of chronic pain in the general population is a major health
      concern given the often profound associated impairment of daily activities,
      employment status, and health-related quality of life in sufferers. Resource
      utilization associated with chronic pain represents an enormous burden for
      healthcare systems. Although analgesia based on the World Health Organization’s
      pain ladder continues to be the mainstay of chronic pain management, aside from
      chronic cancer pain or end-of-life care, prolonged use of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids to manage chronic pain is rarely sustainable. 
      As the endocannabinoid system is known to control pain at peripheral, spinal, and
      supraspinal levels, interest in medical use of cannabis is growing. A proprietary
      blend of cannabis plant extracts containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
      and cannabidiol (CBD) as the principal cannabinoids is formulated as an
      oromucosal spray (USAN name: nabiximols) and standardized to ensure quality,
      consistency and stability. This review examines evidence for THC:CBD oromucosal
      spray (nabiximols) in the management of chronic pain conditions. Cumulative
      evidence from clinical trials and an exploratory analysis of the German Pain
      e-Registry suggests that add-on THC:CBD oromucosal spray (nabiximols) may have a 
      role in managing chronic neuropathic pain, although further precise clinical
      trials are required to draw definitive conclusions.

TI  - Pectoral Nerve (PECs) block for postoperative analgesia-a systematic review and
      meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis.
PG  - 40-50
AB  - Background and objective: Pectoral Nerve (PECs) block is a fascial plane block
      first described by Blanco et al. for postoperative analgesia in breast surgery.
      The procedure is now widely used, and several small clinical trials have been
      published and reported favorably on the analgesic efficacy of PECs block. In this
      systematic review and meta-analysis, we will summarize the current evidence on
      the efficacy of PECs block. Methods: We identified and analyzed 19 randomized
      control trials from PubMed, Central, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science citation
      index, US clinical trials register and Google Scholar. The primary outcome was
      24-hour opioid requirement, and secondary outcomes included pain scores,
      postoperative nausea and vomiting and other complications. Results: Compared to
      systemic analgesia, PECs block was associated with reduced 24 hours opioid
      requirement [mean difference (MD) = -10.66 mg], lower pain score [9-12 hours
      postoperatively: MD = -1.18; 24 hours postoperatively: MD = -0.79] and less
      frequent PONV [risk ratio (RR) = 0.37, numbers needed to treat (NNT) = 5]. While 
      the failure rate of PECs block was not well defined, several studies reported
      significant intraoperative opioid requirement despite PECs block. Lastly, trial
      sequential analysis indicated that no more clinical trials are needed to
      demonstrate the opioid sparing effect of PECs block. Conclusion: When compared to
      general anesthesia with systemic opioids, PECs block was associated with
      significantly better perioperative pain control. There are currently insufficient
      data on the complication and failure rate of PECs block in clinical practice.

TI  - Inhaled Methoxyflurane versus Intravenous Morphine for Severe Trauma Pain in the 
      Emergency Setting: Subgroup Analysis of MEDITA, a Multicenter, Randomized,
      Controlled, Open-Label Trial.
PG  - 491-502
AB  - Purpose: Opioid analgesics remain the cornerstone of treatment for severe trauma 
      pain in the emergency setting, but there are barriers to their use. This post hoc
      analysis of a previously reported trial (MEDITA) investigated the efficacy and
      safety of low-dose methoxyflurane versus intravenous (IV) morphine for severe
      trauma pain. Patients and Methods: MEDITA was a Phase IIIb, randomized,
      active-controlled, parallel-group, open-label study in Italian pre-hospital units
      and emergency departments (EudraCT: 2017-001565-25; NCT03585374). Adult patients 
      (N=272) with moderate-to-severe trauma pain (score ≥4 on the Numerical Rating
      Scale [NRS]) were randomized 1:1 to inhaled methoxyflurane (3 mL) or standard
      analgesic treatment (SAT; IV paracetamol 1g or ketoprofen 100mg for moderate pain
      [NRS 4–6] and IV morphine 0.1mg/kg for severe pain [NRS ≥7]). Analyses were
      performed for the severe pain subgroup. The primary efficacy variable was the
      overall change from baseline in visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity at 3, 5 
      and 10min post-randomization. Non-inferiority of methoxyflurane versus morphine
      was concluded if the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment
      difference was <1; superiority was concluded if the upper 95% CI was <0. Results:
      Ninety-three patients (methoxyflurane: 49; SAT: 44) were included in the severe
      pain intention-to-treat population. The reduction in VAS pain intensity over the 
      first 10min was superior for methoxyflurane versus morphine (adjusted mean
      treatment difference: −5.54mm; 95% CI: −10.49, −0.59mm; p=0.029). Median time to 
      onset of pain relief was 9min for methoxyflurane and 15min for morphine. Patients
      rated treatment efficacy and physicians rated treatment practicality “Excellent” 
      or “Very good” for more methoxyflurane-treated patients (42.8% and 67.3%) than
      morphine-treated patients (18.1% and 22.8%). Adverse events, all non-serious,
      were reported in 20.4% of methoxyflurane-treated patients and in 4.8% of
      morphine-treated patients. Conclusion: Methoxyflurane provided superior
      short-term pain relief to IV morphine in patients with severe trauma pain and
      offers an effective non-narcotic treatment option.

TI  - Escalated Oxycodone Self-Administration and Punishment: Differential Expression
      of Opioid Receptors and Immediate Early Genes in the Rat Dorsal Striatum and
      Prefrontal Cortex.
LID - 1392
AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is characterized by compulsive drug taking despite
      adverse life consequences. Here, we sought to identify neurobiological
      consequences associated with the behavioral effects of contingent footshocks
      administered after escalation of oxycodone self-administration. To reach these
      goals, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer oxycodone for 4 weeks 
      and were then exposed to contingent electric footshocks. This paradigm helped to 
      dichotomize rats into two distinct behavioral phenotypes: (1) those that reduce
      lever pressing (shock-sensitive) and (2) others that continue lever pressing
      (shock-resistant) for oxycodone during contingent punishment. The rats were
      euthanized at 2-h after the last oxycodone plus footshock session. The dorsal
      striata and prefrontal cortices were dissected for use in western blot and
      RT-qPCR analyses. All oxycodone self-administration rats showed significant
      decreased expression of Mu and Kappa opioid receptor proteins only in the dorsal 
      striatum. However, expression of Delta opioid receptor protein was decreased in
      both brain regions. RT-qPCR analyses documented significant decreases in the
      expression of c-fos, fosB, fra2, junB, egr1, and egr2 mRNAs in the dorsal
      striatum (but not in PFC) of the shock-sensitive rats. In the PFC, junD
      expression was reduced in both phenotypes. However, egr3 mRNA expression was
      increased in the PFC of only shock-resistant rats. These results reveal that,
      similar to psychostimulants and alcohol, footshocks can dichotomize rats that
      escalated their intake of oxycodone into two distinct behavioral phenotypes.
      These animals also show significant differences in the mRNA expression of
      immediate early genes, mainly, in the dorsal striatum. The increases in PFC egr3 
      expression in the shock-resistant rats suggest that Egr3 might be involved in the
      persistence of oxycodone-associated memory under aversive conditions. This
      punishment-driven model may help to identify neurobiological substrates of
      persistent oxycodone taking and abstinence in the presence of adverse
      consequences.

      USA: Variations in buprenorphine and methadone treatment by geography,
      operational, and payment characteristics, 2007-16.
LID - e0229787
AB  - Objective: To identify the geographic, organisational, and payment correlates of 
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment among substance abuse treatment (SAT)
      providers. Methods: Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Substance Abuse 
      Treatment Services (NSSATS) from 2007–16 were conducted. We provide bivariate
      descriptive statistics regarding substance abuse treatment services which offered
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment from 2007–16. Using multiple logistic
      regression, we regressed geographic, organisational, and payment correlates on
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment. Results: Buprenorphine is increasingly
      offered at SAT facilities though uptake remains comparatively low outside of the 
      northeast. SAT facilities run by tribal governments or Indian Health Service
      which offer buprenorphine remain low compared to privately operated SAT
      facilities (AOR = 0.528). The odds of offering buprenorphine among facilities
      offering free or no charge treatment (AOR = 0.838) or a sliding fee scale (AOR = 
      0.464) was lower. SAT facilities accepting Medicaid payments showed higher odds
      of offering methadone treatment (AOR = 2.035). Conclusions: Greater attention
      towards the disparities in provision of opioid agonist therapies is warranted,
      especially towards the reasons why uptake has been moderate among civilian
      providers. Additionally, the care needs of Native Americans facing opioid-related
      use disorders bears further scrutiny.

TI  - Use of analgesics in acute stroke patients with inability to self-report pain: a 
      retrospective cohort study.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Pain is a common and burdensome complication in patients with acute
      stroke. We assessed the impact of impaired communication in stroke patients on
      pain assessment and treatment. Methods: We included 909 (507 male, mean age
      71.8 years) patients admitted to our stroke unit from 01/2015 to 12/2015 in the
      analysis. Patients were assigned to four groups: able to communicate (AC), not
      able to communicate prior to index stroke (P-NAC), due to focal symptoms of index
      stroke (S-NAC), due to a reduced level of consciousness (C-NAC). Pain prevalence,
      documentation of pain and use of analgesics were evaluated. C-NAC patients were
      excluded from analyses regarding analgesic treatment due to relevant differences 
      in patient characteristics. Results: 746 patients (82.1%) were classified as AC, 
      25 (2.8%) as P-NAC, 90 (9.9%) as S-NAC and 48 (5.3%) as C-NAC. Pain was
      documented on the Numeric Rating Scale and in form of free text by nurses and
      physicians. Nurses documented pain more frequently than physicians (p < 0.001).
      Pain prevalence was 47.0% (n.s. between groups). The use of analgesic medication 
      increased from 48.7% in the AC group, to 76.0% in the P-NAC group, and 77.8% in
      the S-NAC group (p < 0.001). Opioid use was significantly more frequent in NAC
      patients (p < 0.001). The response to the treatment was poorly documented with
      significantly lowest rates in S-NAC patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study 
      suggests that post-stroke pain in patients with inability to communicate is not
      attended enough, not systematically assessed and therefore not sufficiently
      treated.

LID - 1680
AB  - Tramadol is widely used globally and is the second most prescribed opioid in the 
      United States. It treats moderate to severe pain but lethal opioid-induced
      respiratory depression is uncommon even in large overdose. It is unknown why
      tramadol spares respiration. Here we show its active metabolite, desmetramadol,
      is as effective as morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl in eliciting G protein
      coupling at the human µ opioid receptor (MOR), but surprisingly, supratherapeutic
      concentrations spare human MOR-mediated βarrestin2 recruitment thought to mediate
      lethal opioid-induced respiratory depression.

LID - 2050313X20907015
AB  - Opioid medication–related deaths have increased to epidemic proportions in the
      last decade. This report describes a case of 43-year-old female with a traumatic 
      brain injury who developed chronic pain and opioid dependence. The patient
      expressed concerns and wanted weaning off opioids. Recent legalization of medical
      marijuana in Pennsylvania allows us to try it as an alternative to opioids for
      chronic pain. Medical cannibus has risks associated with administration but is
      safer than opioids. Our patient was successfully weaned off her opioid
      medications with the help of medical cannibus and pain remained well controlled. 
      More studies need to be done on using medical cannibus as an alternative to
      opioids.

TI  - Stratified analyses of genome wide association study data reveal haplotypes for a
      candidate gene on chromosome 2 (KIAA1211L) is associated with opioid use in
      patients of Arabian descent.
LID - 41
AB  - Background: Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been conducted to
      identify genes and pathways involved in development of opioid use disorder. This 
      study extends the first GWAS of substance use disorder (SUD) patients from the
      United Arab Emirates (UAE) by stratifying the study group based on opioid use,
      which is the most common substance of use in this cohort. Methods: The GWAS
      cohort consisted of 512 (262 case, 250 controls) male participants from the UAE. 
      The samples were genotyped using the Illumina Omni5 Exome system. Data was
      stratified according to opioid use using PLINK. Haplotype analysis was conducted 
      using Haploview 4.2. Results: Two main associations were identified in this
      study. Firstly, two SNPs on chromosome 7 were associated with opioid use
      disorder, rs118129027 (p-value = 1.23 × 10 − 8) and rs74477937
      (p-value = 1.48 × 10 − 8). This has been reported in Alblooshi et al. (Am J Med
      Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet 180(1):68–79, 2019). Secondly, haplotypes on
      chromosome 2 which mapped to the KIAA1211L locus were identified in association
      with opioid use. Five SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (rs2280142,
      rs6542837, rs12712037, rs10175560, rs11900524) were arranged into haplotypes. Two
      haplotypes GAGCG and AGTTA were associated with opioid use disorders (p-value
      3.26 × 10− 8 and 7.16 × 10− 7, respectively). Conclusion: This is the first GWAS 
      to identify candidate genes associated with opioid use disorder in participants
      from the UAE. The lack of other genetic data of Arabian descent opioid use
      patients has hindered replication of the findings. Nevertheless, the outcomes
      implicate new pathways in opioid use disorder that requires further research to
      assess the role of the identified genes in the development of opioid use
      disorder.

TI  - The effect of gestational diabetes mellitus on sufentanil consumption after
      cesarean section: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown that patients with long-term diabetes
      require more opioids after surgery than patients without diabetes. Gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) normally only lasts for a brief period; nevertheless, its
      effect on sufentanil consumption after cesarean section is unknown. Methods: This
      prospective cohort study included two groups: a GDM group (n = 32) and a matched 
      non-GDM (NGDM) group (n = 32). All patients underwent routine combined
      spinal-epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Sufentanil consumption through 
      an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, the frequency of PCA
      requests, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores 6 and 24 h after surgery were
      compared between groups. Results: Sufentanil consumption (μg) 6 h after surgery
      was higher in the GDM group than in the NGDM group (24.0 ± 6.6 vs 20.1 ± 5.7,
      P = 0.023). PCA was used more frequently 6 and 24 h after surgery by the GDM
      group than by the NGDM group (1[0–2] vs 0[0–1], P = 0.001; 6 [1–5] vs 3 [1, 2,
      6–8], P = 0.001, respectively). The VAS score during activity 24 h after surgery 
      was higher in the GDM group than in the NGDM group (5 [2, 3] vs 5 [1, 2],
      respectively, P = 0.03). Conclusion: Pregnant women with GDM require more opioids
      during the immediate postoperative period after cesarean section than those
      without GDM. Clinical trials registration: No. ChiCTR1800016014, ChenYang, May

TI  - Mining and visualizing high-order directional drug interaction effects using the 
      FAERS database.
LID - 50
AB  - Background: Adverse drug events (ADEs) often occur as a result of drug-drug
      interactions (DDIs). The use of data mining for detecting effects of drug
      combinations on ADE has attracted growing attention and interest, however, most
      studies focused on analyzing pairwise DDIs. Recent efforts have been made to
      explore the directional relationships among high-dimensional drug combinations
      and have shown effectiveness on prediction of ADE risk. However, the existing
      approaches become inefficient from both computational and illustrative
      perspectives when considering more than three drugs. Methods: We proposed an
      efficient approach to estimate the directional effects of high-order DDIs through
      frequent itemset mining, and further developed a novel visualization method to
      organize and present the high-order directional DDI effects involving more than
      three drugs in an interactive, concise and comprehensive manner. We demonstrated 
      its performance by mining the directional DDIs associated with myopathy using a
      publicly available FAERS dataset. Results: Directional effects of DDIs involving 
      up to seven drugs were reported. Our analysis confirmed previously reported
      myopathy associated DDIs including interactions between fusidic acid with
      simvastatin and atorvastatin. Furthermore, we uncovered a number of novel DDIs
      leading to increased risk for myopathy, such as the co-administration of
      zoledronate with different types of drugs including antibiotics (ciprofloxacin,
      levofloxacin) and analgesics (acetaminophen, fentanyl, gabapentin, oxycodone).
      Finally, we visualized directional DDI findings via the proposed tool, which
      allows one to interactively select any drug combination as the baseline and zoom 
      in/out to obtain both detailed and overall picture of interested drugs.
      Conclusions: We developed a more efficient data mining strategy to identify
      high-order directional DDIs, and designed a scalable tool to visualize high-order
      DDI findings. The proposed method and tool have the potential to contribute to
      the drug interaction research and ultimately impact patient health care.

TI  - Association Between Formulary Coverage and Use of Abuse-Deterrent Prescription
      Opioids, Risk for Abuse or Overdose, and Associated Healthcare Resource
      Utilization.
PG  - 21-31
AB  - Background: Significant public health concerns exist regarding the misuse and
      abuse of prescription opioids. Abuse-deterrent formulation (ADF) opioids may be
      leveraged as an important tool for combating the current opioid crisis.
      Objectives: To evaluate the relationships between ADF opioid formulary coverage
      and the ADF utilization rate, the risk for opioid abuse or overdose, opioid abuse
      or overdose–related healthcare resource utilization, and medical costs within a
      calendar year. Methods: This cross-sectional multiyear panel study included
      adults prescribed an opioid medication in 2015 or 2016. We analyzed the medical
      and pharmacy claims linked to health plan benefit design data. An ADF
      opioid—including reformulated oxycodone hydrochloride (HCl) controlled-release
      (CR; reformulated OxyContin), morphine sulfate and naltrexone HCl
      extended-release (ER; Embeda), and hydrocodone bitartrate ER (Hysingla ER)—was
      considered covered if it was listed on the health plan's formulary. Generalized
      linear models were used to assess the association between ADF opioid formulary
      coverage and the study outcomes. Results: Of 1,350,607 eligible patients, those
      enrolled in health plans with coverage of ADF opioids were more likely to fill a 
      prescription for an ADF opioid than those enrolled in plans that did not cover
      ADF opioids. The risk for opioid abuse or overdose was significantly lower among 
      patients enrolled in plans with broader ADF coverage (adjusted odds ratio [OR],
      0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86–0.95 for oxycodone HCl CR only vs no ADF
      coverage; adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.67–0.73 for oxycodone HCl CR plus ≥1 ADF
      opiods vs no ADF; adjusted OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73–0.81 for oxycodone HCl CR plus 
      ≥1 ADF opiods vs oxycodone HCl CR only; all P <.0001). Approximately 15% and 25% 
      reductions in the opioid abuse or overdose–related hospitalization rate and
      medical costs were observed for those in the oxycodone HCl CR plus ≥1 ADF opioids
      coverage group versus those without ADF opioid coverage. Conclusions: Broad
      formulary coverage of ADF opioids is associated with reduced rates of opioid
      abuse or overdose in real-world managed care populations. Health plan
      administrators and policymakers may consider improving the formulary coverage of 
      ADF opioids as a strategy to ensure appropriate patient access to necessary pain 
      medications while mitigating risk for opioid abuse or overdose.

TI  - The efficacy of continuous versus single-injection femoral nerve block in Total
      knee Arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 121
AB  - Background: Continuous femoral nerve block (cFNB) has been developed to extend
      the analgesic effect since the efficacy of single-injection femoral nerve block
      (sFNB) is often limited to approximately 16–24 h. The aim of this meta-analysis
      was to validate the add-on effect of cFNB in the setting of a multimodal
      analgesic protocol. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature review on
      Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library and PubMed. Eight randomized
      controlled trials (N = 626) that compared the efficacy of cFNB with sFNB were
      included. The primary outcome domains consist of visual analog scale (VAS) score 
      at postoperative 24 and 48 h. The secondary outcome domains include opioid
      consumption, length of hospital stay and incidence of nausea. Results: Our
      analysis revealed that cFNB was associated with a lower VAS score at 24 h (SMD:
      -0.277;95% CI − 0.503 to − 0.05). However, the difference of VAS score did not
      meet the minimal clinically importance difference for total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA). VAS score at 48 h was similar between the cFNB and sFNB group. The cFNB
      group was associated with less amount of opioids consumed at both 24(SMD:
      -1.056;95% CI − 1.737 to − 0.375) and 48 h(SMD: -1.040;95% CI − 1.790 to
      − 0.289). Length of hospital stay and incidence of nausea were similar between
      the two groups. Conclusion: In the setting of a multimodal analgesic protocol,
      patients might benefit from cFNB with regards to a reduced need of opioids in the
      early postoperative period. However, we did not find a clinically significant
      difference in pain scores at different time points between the cFNB and sFNB
      group. Level of evidence: I; meta-analysis.

TI  - Palliative Care Symptoms, Outcomes, and Interventions for Chronic Advanced
      Patients in Spanish Nursing Homes with and without Dementia.
LID - 1465
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the symptomatology, palliative care
      outcomes, therapeutic procedures, diagnostic tests, and pharmacological
      treatments for people with dementia (PWD) and without dementia (PW/OD) admitted
      to Spanish nursing homes. Design: This was a cross-sectional study which is part 
      of a long-term prospective follow-up of elderly people performed in nursing homes
      to measure end-of-life care processes. Participants: 107 nursing home patients
      with advanced or terminal chronic diseases were selected according to the
      criteria of the Palliative Care Spanish Society. Setting: Two trained nurses from
      each nursing home were responsible for participant selection and data collection.
      They must have treated the residents and had a minimum seniority of 6 months in
      the nursing home. Measurements: Sociodemographic data; Edmonton Symptom
      Assessment Scale; Palliative Care Outcome Scale; and prevalence of diagnostic
      tests, pharmacological treatments, and therapeutic procedures were evaluated.
      Results: Pain, fatigue, and nausea were found to be significantly higher in the
      nondementia group and insomnia, poor appetite, and drowsiness were significantly 
      higher in the dementia group. Patient anxiety, support, feeling that life was
      worth living, self-worth, and practical matters management were higher in the
      nondementia group. Regarding drugs, use of corticoids was higher in the
      nondementia group, while use of anxiolytics was higher in the dementia group.
      Diagnostic procedures such as urine analysis and X-ray were higher in the
      dementia group. Conclusions: Differences in symptom perception, diagnostic tests,
      and pharmacological procedures were found between patients with and without
      dementia. Specific diagnostic tools need to be developed for patients with
      dementia.

TI  - Enhanced Recovery and Early Extubation after Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Using
      Single-Dose Intravenous Methadone.
PG  - 70-4
AB  - Background/Aims:: Methadone may offer advantages in facilitating early extubation
      after cardiac surgery, but very few data are available in the pediatric
      population. Setting/Design:: Community tertiary children's hospital,
      retrospective case series. Materials and Methods:: We performed a retrospective
      analysis of all pediatric cardiac surgical patients for whom early extubation was
      intended. A multimodal analgesic regimen was used for all patients, consisting of
      methadone (0.2–0.3 mg/kg), ketamine (0.5 mg/kg plus 0.25 mg/kg/h), lidocaine (1
      mg/kg plus 1.5 mg/kg/h), acetaminophen (15 mg/kg), and parasternal ropivacaine
      (0.5 mL/kg of 0.2%). Outcome variables were collected with descriptive
      statistics. Results:: A total of 24 children [median = 7 (interquartile range =
      3.75–13.75) years old, 23.7 (14.8–53.4) kg] were included in the study; 22 (92%) 
      had procedures performed on bypass and 11 (46%) involved a reentry sternotomy.
      Methadone dosing was 0.26 (0.23–0.29) mg/kg. None of the children required
      intraoperative supplemental opioids; 23 (96%) were extubated in the operating
      room. The first paCO2 on pediatric intensive care unit admission was 51 (45–58)
      mmHg. Time to first supplemental opioid administration was 5.1 (3.5–9.5) h.
      Cumulative total supplemental opioids (in intravenous morphine equivalents) at 24
      and 72 h were 0.2 (0.09–0.32) and 0.42 (0.27–0.68) mg/kg. One child required
      postoperative bilevel positive airway pressure support, but none required
      reintubation. None had pruritus; three (13%) experienced nausea. Conclusion:: A
      methadone-based multimodal regimen facilitated early extubation without
      appreciable adverse events. Further investigations are needed to confirm efficacy
      of this regimen and to assess whether the excellent safety profile seen here
      holds in the hands of multiple providers caring for a larger, more heterogeneous 
      population.

TI  - 10-kHz High-Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation for Adults With Chronic Noncancer
      Pain: A Health Technology Assessment.
PG  - 1-109
AB  - Background: Chronic pain is costly for patients and for the health care system.
      It negatively affects people's physical, emotional, social, and mental health. We
      conducted a health technology assessment of 10-kHz high-frequency spinal cord
      stimulation (SCS) in adults with chronic noncancer pain that was refractory to
      medical management, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety,
      cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency
      SCS, and patient preferences and values. Methods: We performed a systematic
      literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each 
      included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias and ROBINS-I tools and the quality
      of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
      Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a
      systematic economic literature search. We analyzed the 5-year budget impact of
      publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in Ontario for adults with chronic
      noncancer pain who had already tried other available SCS therapies (up to 1.2
      kHz). To contextualize the potential value of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS, we spoke
      with people who had chronic noncancer pain. Results: We included 5 studies (7
      publications) in the clinical evidence review. Overall, 10-kHz high-frequency SCS
      likely provides reductions in pain intensity and functional disability, and
      improvements in quality of life in people with chronic noncancer pain (GRADE:
      Moderate). As well, patients may reduce their opioid consumption with 10-kHz
      high-frequency SCS (GRADE: Low). The two included economic evaluations found that
      10-kHz high-frequency SCS was cost-saving compared with conventional SCS, but
      neither was applicable to the Ontario context. Owing to limited evidence about
      the effectiveness of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in people who have first tried and
      failed SCS at lower frequencies (up to 1.2 kHz), we did not conduct a
      cost-effectiveness analysis comparing this pathway of care and 10-kHz
      high-frequency SCS for Ontario. Publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS (using
      the Freedom SCS system) in Ontario over the next 5 years would lead to a total
      net cost savings of $0.73 million (ranging from about $0.10 million in year 1 to 
      about $0.21 million in year 5). However, if the province outsourced this therapy 
      using the Senza HF10 SCS system, the total 5-year budget impact would be about
      $8.76 million. The people we spoke with who had chronic noncancer pain reported
      that their pain had a substantial negative impact on their activities and
      emotional well-being. Their direct knowledge of different pain therapies allowed 
      them to provide context and comparisons when they discussed the impact of SCS on 
      their chronic pain. Conclusions: For adults with chronic noncancer pain that was 
      refractory to medical management, 10-kHz high-frequency SCS was effective in
      relieving pain, reducing disability, and improving quality of life. Because there
      was limited evidence about the effectiveness of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in
      people who had first tried and failed SCS at lower frequencies (up to 1.2 kHz),
      we were unable to determine whether 10-kHz high-frequency SCS is cost-effective
      in the Ontario context. We estimate that publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency
      SCS in Ontario would result in cost savings of about $0.10 million to $0.21
      million per year, for a potential total 5-year net cost savings of about $0.73
      million. Although people with chronic noncancer pain knew little about SCS before
      they received it, they reported that it reduced their level of chronic pain,
      leading to improvements in function and their ability to perform activities of
      daily living.

TI  - Mu Opioid Receptor 1 (MOR-1) Expression in Colorectal Cancer and Oncological
      Long-Term Outcomes: A Five-Year Retrospective Longitudinal Cohort Study.
LID - 134
AB  - Preclinical evidence has shown increased expression of mu opioid receptor 1
      (MOR-1) in colorectal cancer although its association with disease-free and
      overall survival (DFS and OS) has not been investigated. We hypothesized that
      MOR-1 was overexpressed in tumor samples compared to normal tissue and this was
      associated with decreased DFS and OS. We carried out a retrospective study
      assessing the association of MOR-1 tumor expression with long-term outcomes by
      immunohistochemistry in normal and tumor samples from 174 colorectal cancer
      patients. The primary endpoint was five years of DFS. Secondary endpoints were
      five years of OS, the difference in MOR-1 expression between normal and tumor
      tissue and the occurrence of postoperative complications. Multivariable Cox
      regression showed no significant association between MOR-1 expression and DFS (HR
      0.791, 95% CI 0.603–1.039, p = 0.092). MOR-1 expression was higher in tumor
      tissue compared to non-tumor tissue. No associations were found between MOR-1
      expression and OS or postoperative complications. These findings suggest that
      although MOR-1 is over-expressed in colorectal cancer samples there is no
      association to increased risk of recurrence or mortality. Future studies are
      warranted to elucidate the role of cancer stage, genetic polymorphism, and
      quantitative assessment of MOR-1 over-expression on long-term outcomes in
      colorectal cancer.

TI  - Medicinal cannabis for psychiatric disorders: a clinically-focused systematic
      review.
LID - 24
AB  - Background: Medicinal cannabis has received increased research attention over
      recent years due to loosening global regulatory changes. Medicinal cannabis has
      been reported to have potential efficacy in reducing pain, muscle spasticity,
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and intractable childhood epilepsy. Yet
      its potential application in the field of psychiatry is lesser known. Methods:
      The first clinically-focused systematic review on the emerging medical
      application of cannabis across all major psychiatric disorders was conducted.
      Current evidence regarding whole plant formulations and plant-derived cannabinoid
      isolates in mood, anxiety, sleep, psychotic disorders and attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is discussed; while also detailing clinical
      prescription considerations (including pharmacogenomics), occupational and public
      health elements, and future research recommendations. The systematic review of
      the literature was conducted during 2019, assessing the data from all case
      studies and clinical trials involving medicinal cannabis or plant-derived
      isolates for all major psychiatric disorders (neurological conditions and pain
      were omitted). Results: The present evidence in the emerging field of cannabinoid
      therapeutics in psychiatry is nascent, and thereby it is currently premature to
      recommend cannabinoid-based interventions. Isolated positive studies have,
      however, revealed tentative support for cannabinoids (namely cannabidiol; CBD)
      for reducing social anxiety; with mixed (mainly positive) evidence for adjunctive
      use in schizophrenia. Case studies suggest that medicinal cannabis may be
      beneficial for improving sleep and post-traumatic stress disorder, however
      evidence is currently weak. Preliminary research findings indicate no benefit for
      depression from high delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) therapeutics, or for CBD 
      in mania. One isolated study indicates some potential efficacy for an oral
      cannabinoid/terpene combination in ADHD. Clinical prescriptive consideration
      involves caution in the use of high-THC formulations (avoidance in youth, and in 
      people with anxiety or psychotic disorders), gradual titration, regular
      assessment, and caution in cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, pregnancy
      and breast-feeding. Conclusions: There is currently encouraging, albeit
      embryonic, evidence for medicinal cannabis in the treatment of a range of
      psychiatric disorders. Supportive findings are emerging for some key isolates,
      however, clinicians need to be mindful of a range of prescriptive and
      occupational safety considerations, especially if initiating higher dose THC
      formulas.

TI  - The burden of headache following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a
      prospective single-center cross-sectional analysis.
PG  - 893-903
AB  - Background: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as a serious type of stroke 
      is frequently accompanied by a so-called initial thunderclap headache. However,
      the occurrence of burdensome long-term headache following SAH has never been
      studied in detail so far. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence
      and characteristics of long-term burdensome headache in good-grade SAH patients
      as well as its relation to health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Methods: All 
      SAH cases treated between January 2014 and December 2016 with preserved
      consciousness at hospital discharge were prospectively interviewed regarding
      burdensome headache in 2018. Study participants were subsequently scrutinized by 
      means of a standardized postal survey comprising validated pain and HR-QOL
      questionnaires. A retrospective chart review provided data on the initial
      treatment. Results: A total of 93 out of 145 eligible SAH patients participated
      in the study (62 females). A total of 41% (38/93) of subjects indicated
      burdensome headache at follow-up (mean 32.6 ± 9.3 months). Comparison between
      patients with (HA+) and without long-term headache (HA-) revealed significantly
      younger mean age (47.9 ± 11.8 vs. 55.6 ± 10.3 years; p < .01) as well as more
      favorable neurological conditions (WFNS I/II: 95% vs. 75%; p = .03) in HA+ cases.
      The mean average headache of the HA+ group was 3.7 ± 2.3 (10-point numeric rating
      scale), and the mean maximum headache intensity was 5.7 ± 2.9. Pain and HR-QOL
      scores demonstrated profound alterations in HA+ compared to HA- patients.
      Conclusions: Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of SAH patients
      suffers from burdensome headache even years after the hemorrhage. Moreover,
      long-term headache is associated with reduced HR-QOL in these cases. Electronic

TI  - Risk factors for pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations in long-term care
      facility residents: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 47
AB  - Background: Older adults who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at
      particularly high risk for infection, morbidity and mortality from pneumonia and 
      influenza (P&I) compared to individuals of younger age and those living outside
      institutional settings. The risk factors for P&I hospitalizations that are
      specific to LTCFs remain poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the
      incidence of P&I hospitalization and associated person- and facility-level
      factors among post-acute (short-stay) and long-term (long-stay) care residents
      residing in LTCFs from 2013 to 2015. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study,
      we used Medicare administrative claims linked to Minimum Data Set and LTCF-level 
      data to identify short-stay (< 100 days, index = admission date) and long-stay
      (100+ days, index = day 100) residents who were followed from the index date
      until the first of hospitalization, LTCF discharge, Medicare disenrollment, or
      death. We measured incidence rates (IRs) for P&I hospitalization per 100,000
      person-days, and estimated associations with baseline demographics, geriatric
      syndromes, clinical characteristics, and medication use using Cox regression
      models. Results: We analyzed data from 1,118,054 short-stay and 593,443 long-stay
      residents. The crude 30-day IRs (95% CI) of hospitalizations with P&I in the
      principal position were 26.0 (25.4, 26.6) and 34.5 (33.6, 35.4) among short- and 
      long-stay residents, respectively. The variables associated with P&I varied
      between short and long-stay residents, and common risk factors included: advanced
      age (85+ years), admission from an acute hospital, select cardiovascular and
      respiratory conditions, impaired functional status, and receipt of antibiotics or
      Beers criteria medications. Facility staffing and care quality measures were
      important risk factors among long-stay residents but not in short-stay residents.
      Conclusions: Short-stay residents had lower crude 30- and 90-day incidence rates 
      of P&I hospitalizations than long-stay LTCF residents. Differences in risk
      factors for P&I between short- and long-stay populations suggest the importance
      of considering distinct profiles of post-acute and long-term care residents in
      infection prevention and control strategies in LTCFs. These findings can help
      clinicians target interventions to subgroups of LTCF residents at highest P&I
      risk.

TI  - Concerned topics of epidural labor analgesia: labor elongation and maternal
      pyrexia: a systematic review.
PG  - 597-605
AB  - Objective:: Labor is a complex process and labor pain presents challenges for
      analgesia. Epidural analgesia (EA) has a well-known analgesic effect and is
      commonly used during labor. This review summarized frequently encountered and
      controversial problems surrounding EA during labor, including the labor process
      and maternal intrapartum fever, to build knowledge in this area. Data sources::
      We searched for relevant articles published up to 2019 in PubMed using a range of
      search terms (eg, “labor pain,” “epidural,” “analgesia,” “labor process,”
      “maternal pyrexia,” “intrapartum fever”). Study selection:: The search returned
      835 articles, including randomized control trials, retrospective cohort studies, 
      observational studies, and reviews. The articles were screened by title,
      abstract, and then full-text, with a sample independently screened by two
      authors. Thirty-eight articles were included in our final analysis; 20 articles
      concerned the labor process and 18 reported on maternal pyrexia during EA.
      Results:: Four classic prospective studies including 14,326 participants compared
      early and delayed initiation of EA by the incidence of cesarean delivery. Early
      initiation following an analgesia request was preferred. However, it was
      controversial whether continuous use of EA in the second stage of labor induced
      adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes due to changes in analgesic and epidural
      infusion regimens. There was a high incidence of maternal pyrexia in women
      receiving EA and women with placental inflammation or histologic chorioamnionitis
      compared with those receiving systemic opioids. Conclusions:: Early EA (cervical 
      dilation ≥1 cm) does not increase the risk for cesarean section. Continuous
      epidural application of low doses of analgesics and programmed intermittent
      epidural bolus do not prolong second-stage labor duration or impact maternal and 
      neonatal outcomes. The association between EA and maternal pyrexia remains
      controversial, but pyrexia is more common with EA than without. A non-infectious 
      inflammatory process is an accepted mechanism of epidural-related maternal fever.

TI  - Gender Norms, Roles and Relations and Cannabis-Use Patterns: A Scoping Review.
LID - 947
AB  - Currently, boys and men use cannabis at higher rates than girls and women, but
      the gender gap is narrowing. With the legalization of recreational cannabis use
      in Canada and in multiple US states, these trends call for urgent attention to
      the need to consider how gender norms, roles and relations influence patterns of 
      cannabis use to inform health promotion and prevention responses. Based on a
      scoping review on sex, gender and cannabis use, this article consolidates
      existing evidence from the academic literature on how gender norms, roles and
      relations impact cannabis-use patterns. Evidence is reviewed on: adherence to
      dominant masculine and feminine norms and cannabis-use patterns among adolescents
      and young adults, and how prevailing norms can be both reinstated or reimagined
      through cannabis use; gendered social dynamics in cannabis-use settings; and the 
      impact of gender roles and relations on cannabis use among young adults of
      diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. Findings from the review are
      compared and contrasted with evidence on gender norms, roles and relations in the
      context of alcohol and tobacco use. Recommendations for integrating gender
      transformative principles in health promotion and prevention responses to
      cannabis use are provided.

TI  - Increased risk of perforated appendicitis in patients with schizophrenia and
      dementia: A population-based case-control study.
LID - e18919
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that patients with psychotic or mental disorders 
      are relatively pain insensitive, resulting in difficulties in the diagnosis of
      acute intra-abdominal diseases requiring emergency surgeries. We aimed to
      evaluate whether central nervous system (CNS) or mental disorders are associated 
      with perforated appendicitis in patients with acute appendicitis.We conducted a
      population-based case-control study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance
      Research database. Patients aged >18 years who had been hospitalized with a
      diagnosis of acute appendicitis between 2000 and 2013 were identified. After 1:1 
      matching for age and sex, 2792 patients with perforated appendicitis (case group)
      and 2792 patients with nonperforated appendicitis (control group) were included. 
      CNS disorders, mental disorders, pain control medication, and several
      comorbidities were analyzed for the odds of appendiceal perforation with 95%
      confidence interval (CI) using the multivariable logistic regression
      model.Schizophrenia and dementia were associated with a high risk of appendiceal 
      rupture in patients with acute appendicitis, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.01 
      for dementia (95% CI: 1.19–3.39, P = .009) and 4.8 for schizophrenia (95% CI:
      1.62–14.19, P = .005). Other factors, such as other CNS disorders, comorbidities,
      and pain control medication, were not associated with the risk of perforated
      appendicitis.Dementia and schizophrenia are associated with perforated
      appendicitis in patients with acute appendicitis. This might be owing to altered 
      pain perception, difficult symptom expression, and delayed hospitalization.
      Further studies are still needed to determine the underlying mechanism and
      confirm the causality.

TI  - Development of a Biodegradable Subcutaneous Implant for Prolonged Drug Delivery
      Using 3D Printing.
LID - 105
AB  - Implantable drug delivery devices offer many advantages over other routes of drug
      delivery. Most significantly, the delivery of lower doses of drug, thus,
      potentially reducing side-effects and improving patient compliance. Three
      dimensional (3D) printing is a flexible technique, which has been subject to
      increasing interest in the past few years, especially in the area of medical
      devices. The present work focussed on the use of 3D printing as a tool to
      manufacture implantable drug delivery devices to deliver a range of model
      compounds (methylene blue, ibuprofen sodium and ibuprofen acid) in two in vitro
      models. Five implant designs were produced, and the release rate varied,
      depending on the implant design and the drug properties. Additionally, a rate
      controlling membrane was produced, which further prolonged the release from the
      produced implants, signalling the potential use of these devices for chronic
      conditions.

TI  - Opioid-induced immunosuppression and carcinogenesis promotion theories create the
      newest trend in acute and chronic pain pharmacotherapy.
LID - e1554
AB  - Opioids are the main group of pharmacological agents used during the
      perioperative period and provide a sedative and analgesic component. The
      observations of opioid consumption in West Europe indicate that this group of
      drugs is widely used in chronic noncancer pain therapy.Nearly 20 years ago, the
      first publications indicating that opioids, as an element of perioperative
      pharmacotherapy in oncologic patients, increase the risk of tumor recurrence and 
      affect further prognosis were presented. The actual publications suggest that
      there are multifactorial, complex mechanisms underlying the immunological impact 
      and carcinogenesis promotion of opioids and that the intensity varies depending
      on the type of opioid. There are also questions about the immunosuppressive
      effects among patients receiving opioids in the treatment of chronic noncancer
      pain.The aim of the review article is to present information about the action of 
      opioids on the immune system in carcinogenic settings and to define the clinical 
      usefulness of this pharmacological phenomenon.

TI  - Current State of Understanding of the Role of PACAP in the
      Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal Gonadotropin Functions of Mammals.
LID - 88
AB  - PACAP was discovered 30 years ago in Dr. Akira Arimura's laboratory. In the past 
      three decades since then, it has become evident that this peptide plays numerous 
      crucial roles in mammalian organisms. The most important functions of PACAP are
      the following: 1. neurotransmitter, 2. neuromodulator, 3. hypophysiotropic
      hormone, 4. neuroprotector. This paper reviews the accumulated data regarding the
      distribution of PACAP and its receptors in the mammalian hypothalamus and
      pituitary gland, the role of PACAP in the gonadotropin hormone secretion of
      females and males. The review also summarizes the interaction between PACAP,
      GnRH, and sex steroids as well as hypothalamic peptides including kisspeptin. The
      possible role of PACAP in reproductive functions through the biological clock is 
      also discussed. Finally, the significance of PACAP in the hypothalamo-hypophysial
      system is considered and the facts missing, that would help better understand the
      function of PACAP in this system, are also highlighted.

TI  - Concerned topics of epidural labor analgesia: labor elongation and maternal
      pyrexia: a systematic review.
PG  - 597-605
AB  - Objective:: Labor is a complex process and labor pain presents challenges for
      analgesia. Epidural analgesia (EA) has a well-known analgesic effect and is
      commonly used during labor. This review summarized frequently encountered and
      controversial problems surrounding EA during labor, including the labor process
      and maternal intrapartum fever, to build knowledge in this area. Data sources::
      We searched for relevant articles published up to 2019 in PubMed using a range of
      search terms (eg, “labor pain,” “epidural,” “analgesia,” “labor process,”
      “maternal pyrexia,” “intrapartum fever”). Study selection:: The search returned
      835 articles, including randomized control trials, retrospective cohort studies, 
      observational studies, and reviews. The articles were screened by title,
      abstract, and then full-text, with a sample independently screened by two
      authors. Thirty-eight articles were included in our final analysis; 20 articles
      concerned the labor process and 18 reported on maternal pyrexia during EA.
      Results:: Four classic prospective studies including 14,326 participants compared
      early and delayed initiation of EA by the incidence of cesarean delivery. Early
      initiation following an analgesia request was preferred. However, it was
      controversial whether continuous use of EA in the second stage of labor induced
      adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes due to changes in analgesic and epidural
      infusion regimens. There was a high incidence of maternal pyrexia in women
      receiving EA and women with placental inflammation or histologic chorioamnionitis
      compared with those receiving systemic opioids. Conclusions:: Early EA (cervical 
      dilation ≥1 cm) does not increase the risk for cesarean section. Continuous
      epidural application of low doses of analgesics and programmed intermittent
      epidural bolus do not prolong second-stage labor duration or impact maternal and 
      neonatal outcomes. The association between EA and maternal pyrexia remains
      controversial, but pyrexia is more common with EA than without. A non-infectious 
      inflammatory process is an accepted mechanism of epidural-related maternal fever.

TI  - A comparative study of three concentrations of intravenous nalbuphine combined
      with hydromorphone for post-cesarean delivery analgesia.
PG  - 523-9
AB  - Background:: Nalbuphine has been suggested to be used for post-cesarean section
      (CS) intravenous analgesia. However, ideal concentration of nalbuphine for such
      analgesia remains unclear. The present study was conducted to explore an ideal
      concentration of nalbuphine for post-CS intravenous analgesia by evaluating the
      analgesic effects and side-effects of three different concentrations of
      nalbuphine combined with hydromorphone for post-CS intravenous analgesia in
      healthy parturients. Methods:: One-hundred-and-fourteen parturients undergoing
      elective CS were randomly allocated to one of three groups (38 subjects per
      group) according to an Excel-generated random number sheet to receive
      hydromorphone 0.05 mg/mL + nalbuphine 0.5 mg/mL (group LN), hydromorphone 0.05
      mg/mL + nalbuphine 0.7 mg/mL (group MN), and hydromorphone 0.05 mg/mL +
      nalbuphine 0.9 mg/mL (group HN) using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump.
      Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, PCA bolus demands, cumulative PCA dose,
      satisfaction score, Ramsay score, and side-effects such as urinary retention were
      recorded. Results:: The number of PCA bolus demands and cumulative PCA dose
      during the first 48 h after CS were significantly higher in group LN (21 ± 16
      bolus, 129 ± 25 mL) than those in group MN (15 ± 10 bolus, 120 ± 16 mL) (both
      P < 0.05) and group HN (13 ± 9 bolus, 117 ± 13 mL) (both P < 0.01), but no
      difference was found between group HN and group MN (both P > 0.05). VAS scores
      were significantly lower in group HN than those in group MN and group LN for
      uterine cramping pain at rest and after breast-feeding within 12 h after CS (all 
      P < 0.01) and VAS scores were significantly higher in group LN than those in
      group MN and group HN when oxytocin was intravenously infused within 3 days after
      CS (all P < 0.05), whereas VAS scores were not statistically different among
      groups for incisional pain (all P > 0.05). Ramsay sedation scale score in group
      HN was significantly higher than that in group MN at 8 and 12 h after CS (all
      P < 0.01) and group LN at 4, 8, 12, 24 h after CS (all P < 0.05). Conclusions::
      Hydromorphone 0.05 mg/mL + nalbuphine 0.7 mg/mL for intravenous PCA could
      effectively improve the incisional pain and uterine cramping pain management and 
      improve comfort in patients after CS. Trial registration number::

TI  - Optimum interval time of programmed intermittent epidural bolus of ropivacaine
      0.08% with sufentanyl 0.3 μg/mL for labor analgesia: a biased-coin up-and-down
      sequential allocation trial.
PG  - 517-22
AB  - Background:: The programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB) technique is
      widely used in labor analgesia, but the parameter settings of PIEB have not yet
      been standardized. We designed a study to identify the optimal interval duration 
      for PIEB using 10 mL of ropivacaine 0.08% and sufentanyl 0.3 μg/mL, a regimen
      commonly used to control labor pain in China, to provide effective analgesia in
      90% of women during the first stage of labor without breakthrough pain. Methods::
      We conducted a double-blind sequential allocation trial to obtain the effective
      interval 90% (EI90%) during the first stage of labor between April 2019 and May
      2019. This study included the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical
      status II–III nulliparous parturients at term, who requested epidural analgesia. 
      The bolus volume was fixed at 10 mL of ropivacaine 0.08% with sufentanyl 0.3
      μg/mL. Participants were divided into four groups (groups 60, 50, 40, and 30)
      according to the PIEB intervals (60, 50, 40, and 30 min, respectively). The
      interval duration of the first parturient was set at 60 min and that of
      subsequent parturients varied according to a biased-coin design. The truncated
      Dixon and Mood method and the isotonic regression analysis method were used to
      estimate the EI90% and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results:: Forty-four
      women were enrolled in this study. The estimated optimal interval was 44.1 min
      (95% CI 41.7–46.5 min) and 39.5 min (95% CI 32.5–50.0 min), using the truncated
      Dixon and Mood method and isotonic regression analysis, respectively. The maximum
      sensory block level above T6 was in nearly 20% of parturients in group 30;
      however, 5.3%, 0%, and 0% of the parturients presented with sensory block level
      above T6 in groups 40, 50, and 60, respectively. There were no cases of
      hypotension and only one parturient complained of motor block. Conclusion:: With 
      a fixed 10 mL dose of ropivacaine 0.08% with sufentanyl 0.3 μg/mL, the optimal
      PIEB interval is about 42 min. Further studies are warranted to define the
      efficacy of this regimen throughout all stages of labor.Trial registration:

TI  - Adjunct low-dose ketamine infusion vs standard of care in mechanically ventilated
      critically ill patients at a Tertiary Saudi Hospital (ATTAINMENT Trial): study
      protocol for a randomized, prospective, pilot, feasibility trial.
LID - 288
AB  - Background: A noticeable interest in ketamine infusion for sedation management
      has developed among critical care physicians for critically ill patients. The
      2018 Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep disruption
      guideline suggested low-dose ketamine infusion as an adjunct to opioid therapy to
      reduce opioid requirements in post-surgical patients in the intensive care unit
      (ICU). This was, however, rated as conditional due to the very low quality of
      evidence. Ketamine has favorable characteristics, making it an especially viable 
      alternative for patients with respiratory and hemodynamic instability. The
      Analgo-sedative adjuncT keTAmine Infusion iN Mechanically vENTilated ICU patients
      (ATTAINMENT) trial aims to assess the effect and safety of adjunct low-dose
      continuous infusion of ketamine as an analgo-sedative compared to standard of
      care in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) for ≥ 24 h.
      Methods/design: This trial is a prospective, randomized, active controlled,
      open-label, pilot, feasibility study of adult ICU patients (> 14 years old) on
      MV. The study will take place in the adult ICUs in the King Faisal Specialist
      Hospital and Research Center (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and will enroll 80 
      patients. Patients will be randomized post-intubation into two groups: the
      intervention group will receive an adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of
      ketamine plus standard of care. Ketamine will be administered over a period of
      48 h at a fixed infusion rate of 2 μg/kg/min (0.12 mg/kg/h) in the first 24 h
      followed by 1 μg/kg/min (0.06 mg/kg/h) in the second 24 h. The control group will
      receive standard of care in the ICU (propofol and/or fentanyl and/or midazolam)
      according to the KFSH&RC sedation and analgesia protocol as clinically
      appropriate. The primary outcome is MV duration until ICU discharge, death,
      extubation, or 28 days post-randomization, whichever comes first. Discussion: The
      first patient was enrolled on 1 September 2019. As of 10 October 2019, a total of
      16 patients had been enrolled. We expect to complete the recruitment by 31
      December 2020. The findings of this pilot trial will likely justify further
      investigation for the role of adjunct low-dose ketamine infusion as an
      analgo-sedative agent in a larger, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

TI  - In their own words: a qualitative study of factors promoting resilience and
      recovery among postpartum women with opioid use disorders.
LID - 178
AB  - Background: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with substantial morbidity
      and mortality for women, especially during the perinatal period. Opioid overdose 
      has become a significant cause of maternal death in the United States, with rates
      highest in the immediate postpartum year. While pregnancy is a time of high
      motivation for healthcare engagement, unique challenges exist for pregnant women 
      with OUD seeking both substance use treatment and maternity care, including
      managing change after birth. How women successfully navigate these barriers,
      engage in treatment, and abstain from substance use during pregnancy and
      postpartum is poorly understood. The aim of this study is to explore the
      experiences of postpartum women with OUD who successfully engaged in both
      substance use treatment and maternity care during pregnancy, to understand
      factors contributing to their ability to access care and social support. Methods:
      We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with postpartum women in
      sustained recovery (n = 10) engaged in a substance use treatment program in
      northern New England. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory methodology.
      Results: Despite multiple barriers, women identified pregnancy as a change point 
      from which they were able to develop self-efficacy and exercise agency in seeking
      care. A shift in internal motivation enabled women to disclose need for OUD
      treatment to maternity care providers, a profoundly significant moment.
      Concurrently, women developed a new capacity for self-care, demonstrated through 
      managing relationships with providers and family members, and overcoming
      logistical challenges which had previously seemed overwhelming. This
      transformation was also expressed in making decisions based on pregnancy risk,
      engaging with and caring for others, and providing peer support. Women developed 
      resilience through the interaction of inner motivation and their ability to
      positively utilize or transform external factors. Conclusions: Complex
      interactions occurred between individual-level changes in treatment motivation
      due to pregnancy, emerging self-efficacy in accessing resources, and engagement
      with clinicians and peers. This transformative process was identified by women as
      a key factor in entering recovery during pregnancy and sustaining it postpartum. 
      Clinicians and policymakers should target the provision of services which promote
      resilience in pregnant women with OUD.

TI  - Independent prescribing by advanced physiotherapists for patients with low back
      pain in primary care: A feasibility trial with an embedded qualitative component.
LID - e0229792
AB  - Background: Low back pain (LBP) is the most prevalent musculoskeletal condition. 
      Guidelines advocate a multimodal approach, including prescription of medications.
      Advanced Physiotherapy Practitioners (APPs) are well placed to manage LBP. To
      date no trial has evaluated the efficacy of physiotherapist-prescribing for LBP. 
      Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility, suitability and acceptability of
      assessing the effectiveness of physiotherapist-prescribing for LBP in primary
      care; informing the design of a future definitive stepped-wedged cluster trial
      (SWcRCT). Methods: Mixed-methods, single-arm feasibility design with two
      components.1) Trial component: participants with medium-risk LBP +/-leg pain were
      recruited across 3 sites. Outcome measures (primary outcome measures-Pain/RMDQ)
      were completed at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks Physical activity/sedentary behaviour 
      were assessed over 7 days using accelerometery. A CONSORT diagram analysed
      recruitment/follow-up rates. Descriptive analysis evaluated
      procedure/floor-effects.2) Embedded qualitative component: focus groups (n = 6)
      and semi-structured interviews (n = 3) evaluated the views/experiences of
      patients and APPs about feasibility/suitability/acceptability of the proposed
      trial. Thematic analysis synthesised the qualitative data. Findings were
      evaluated against a priori success criteria. Results: n = 29 participants were
      recruited. 90% of success criteria were met. Loss to follow-up at 12 weeks
      (65.5%) did not satisfy success criteria. Primary and secondary outcome measures 
      were suitable and acceptable with no floor effects. The addition of a sleep
      assessment tool was advised. Accelerometer use was acceptable with 100%
      adherence. APPs felt all patients presenting with non-specific LBP +/- leg pain
      and capture data representative of the full scope of physiotherapist independent 
      prescribing should be included. Data collection methods were acceptable to APPs
      and patients. APPs advocated necessity for using research assistants owing to
      time limitations. Conclusions: Methods evaluated are feasible, suitable and
      acceptable for a definitive SWcRCT, with modification of eligibility criteria,
      and use of research assistants to overcome limited clinician capacity. A
      definitive SWcRCT is feasible with minor modifications. Registration:
      ISRCTN15516596.

TI  - Differences between pharmacists’ perception of counseling and practice in the era
      of prescription drug misuse.
LID - 1682
AB  - Objective:: This study was conducted to assess pharmacists’ practices when
      counseling patients on their prescription medications, and their preferences for 
      training. Methods:: Five focus group discussions of community pharmacists (n=45, 
      with seven to eleven participants in each group) were conducted in a major
      metropolitan city in the southern United States. Participants were recruited via 
      email using a list of community pharmacists provided by the Texas State Board of 
      Pharmacy. All focus group discussions were structured using a moderator guide
      consisting of both discrete and open-ended questions. Qualitative analysis
      software was used to analyze the data with a thematic analysis approach.
      Results:: The participants in this study had a high self-efficacy regarding their
      ability to counsel on both new and opioid prescriptions. Many pharmacists
      experienced the same barriers to counseling and agreed on the components of
      counseling. However, the themes that emerged showed that the participants
      exhibited only a partial understanding of the components of counseling. The
      themes that emerged in the thematic analysis were perceived confidence and
      discordant counseling practices, inadequate infrastructure, lack of comprehensive
      counseling, inconsistent use of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), 
      and pharmacists’ desired training/assistance. Conclusions:: Community pharmacists
      are in a unique position to help combat the opioid crisis; however, there has
      been very little research on the pharmacist-patient interaction in this context. 
      With policy changes, such as the PDMP mandate, going into effect across the
      country, it is important to capitalize on the potential community pharmacists
      have in ameliorating the opioid crisis in the United States.

TI  - Trauma-affected refugees treated with basic body awareness therapy or mixed
      physical activity as augmentation to treatment as usual—A pragmatic randomised
      controlled trial.
LID - e0230300
AB  - Background: The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is estimated 
      to be as high as 30% among refugees. The coexistence of prevalent chronic pain is
      believed to maintain symptoms of PTSD and add complexity to the condition.
      Despite this, little evidence exists on how to treat PTSD and comorbid conditions
      best in trauma-affected refugees. Aim: The aim of the present study was to
      investigate if adding either BBAT or mixed physical activity to the treatment as 
      usual (TAU) for trauma-affected refugees with PTSD would increase the treatment
      effect compared to TAU alone. Method: Randomised controlled trial, 3-armed
      parallel group superiority study, conducted at Competence Centre for
      Transcultural Psychiatry, Denmark. Participants were adult trauma-affected
      refugees with PTSD. Allocation ratio was 1:1:1, stratified for PTSD severity and 
      gender. An open-label design was applied due to the nature of the intervention.
      Participants were randomised to receive either individual basic body awareness
      therapy (group B) or individual mixed physical activity (group M) one hour/week
      for 20 weeks plus TAU, or TAU only (group C). The primary outcome was PTSD
      severity measured by Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Trial registration:
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01955538. Results: Of the 338 patients included (C/B/M =
      110/114/114), 318 patients were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis (C/B/M =
      104/105/109). On the primary outcome, intention-to-treat as well as per-protocol 
      analyses showed small but significant improvement on scores from pre- to
      post-treatment in all three groups but with no significant difference in
      improvement between groups. Conclusions: The findings do not provide evidence
      that either BBAT or mixed physical activity as add-on treatment bring
      significantly larger improvement on symptoms of PTSD compared to TAU alone for
      adult, trauma-affected refugees. There is a need for studies on potential
      subpopulations of trauma-affected refugees who could benefit from physical
      activity as a part of their treatment.

TI  - A signal demodulation-based method for the early detection of Cheyne-Stokes
      respiration.
LID - e0221191
AB  - Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) is a sleep-disordered breathing characterized by 
      recurrent central apneas alternating with hyperventilation exhibiting a
      crescendo-decrescendo pattern of tidal volume. This respiration is reported in
      patients with heart failure, stroke or damage in respiratory centers. It
      increases mortality for patients with severe heart failure as it has adverse
      impacts on the cardiac function. Early stage of CSR, also called periodic
      breathing, is often undiagnosed as it only provokes hypopneas instead of apneas, 
      which are much more difficult to detect. This paper demonstrates the proof of
      concept of a new method devoted to the early detection of CSR. The proposed
      approach relies on a signal demodulation technique applied to ventilation signals
      measured on 15 patients with chronic heart failure whose respiration goes from
      normal to severe CSR. Based on a modulation index and its instantaneous
      frequency, oscillation zones are detected and classified into three categories:
      CSR, periodic breathing and no abnormal pattern. The modulation index is used as 
      an efficient indicator to quantify the degree of certainty of the pathology for
      each patient. Results show high correlation with experts’ annotations with
      sensitivity and specificity values of 87.1% and 89.8% respectively. A final
      decision leads to a classification which is confirmed by the experts’
      conclusions.

TI  - The burden of headache following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a
      prospective single-center cross-sectional analysis.
PG  - 893-903
AB  - Background: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as a serious type of stroke 
      is frequently accompanied by a so-called initial thunderclap headache. However,
      the occurrence of burdensome long-term headache following SAH has never been
      studied in detail so far. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence
      and characteristics of long-term burdensome headache in good-grade SAH patients
      as well as its relation to health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Methods: All 
      SAH cases treated between January 2014 and December 2016 with preserved
      consciousness at hospital discharge were prospectively interviewed regarding
      burdensome headache in 2018. Study participants were subsequently scrutinized by 
      means of a standardized postal survey comprising validated pain and HR-QOL
      questionnaires. A retrospective chart review provided data on the initial
      treatment. Results: A total of 93 out of 145 eligible SAH patients participated
      in the study (62 females). A total of 41% (38/93) of subjects indicated
      burdensome headache at follow-up (mean 32.6 ± 9.3 months). Comparison between
      patients with (HA+) and without long-term headache (HA-) revealed significantly
      younger mean age (47.9 ± 11.8 vs. 55.6 ± 10.3 years; p < .01) as well as more
      favorable neurological conditions (WFNS I/II: 95% vs. 75%; p = .03) in HA+ cases.
      The mean average headache of the HA+ group was 3.7 ± 2.3 (10-point numeric rating
      scale), and the mean maximum headache intensity was 5.7 ± 2.9. Pain and HR-QOL
      scores demonstrated profound alterations in HA+ compared to HA- patients.
      Conclusions: Our results suggest that a considerable proportion of SAH patients
      suffers from burdensome headache even years after the hemorrhage. Moreover,
      long-term headache is associated with reduced HR-QOL in these cases. Electronic

TI  - Once-Monthly Long-Acting Injectable Aripiprazole for the Treatment of Patients
      with Schizophrenia and Co-occurring Substance Use Disorders: A Multicentre,
      Observational Study.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and impact of long-acting injectable (LAI)
      aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia with a coexisting substance use
      disorder (SUD). Patients and methods: A multicenter, observational, descriptive
      and retrospective study was conducted in patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of
      schizophrenia who had a coexisting SUD and were treated with LAI-aripiprazole.
      Disease severity was evaluated with the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity
      scale for schizophrenia, daily functioning and disability were evaluated with the
      World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS-2.0), and the
      severity of the addiction was evaluated with the Severity of Dependence Scale
      (SDS). Results: The sample included 40 patients. Overall, after 6 months of
      treatment with LAI-aripiprazole at a dose of 400 mg/4 weeks in 77.5% of the
      patients, we observed significant improvement in the psychopathological symptoms,
      with a reduction of over 30% in the scores of the five CGI-severity scales. The
      WHODAS-2.0 mean (standard deviation) score was also significantly reduced from
      57.6 (8.2) to 42.3 (4.3) points (p < 0.001). Regarding SUDs, after 6 months of
      treatment, substance use was stopped in 5 of the 9 patients with cocaine use
      disorder and in 3 of the 16 patients with alcohol abuse disorder. A significant
      reduction in the severity of the dependence was observed only in the subgroups of
      participants with cocaine and alcohol use disorders. Conclusion: Our study
      suggests that once-monthly LAI-aripiprazole retains its antipsychotic efficacy in
      patients with schizophrenia and a coexisting SUD and could be useful for the
      management of cocaine or alcohol use disorders in this population.

TI  - Efficacy of Tuina in patients with chronic low back pain: study protocol for a
      randomized controlled trial.
LID - 271
AB  - Background: Low back pain is a common reason for medical care and carries a heavy
      social burden. The efficacy of Tuina or health care education for low back pain
      has been evaluated in previous systematic reviews. However, there is no evidence 
      to support the superiority of one form of treatment over another. The aim of this
      study is to compare the efficacy of Tuina with health care education in the
      management of low back pain. Methods/design: This study is a randomized
      controlled trial with parallel-group design including two groups: a Tuina group
      and a health care education group. A total of 160 eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to the groups in a 1:1 ratio. The interventions of both groups 
      will last for 20 min and be carried out twice each week for a period of 12 weeks.
      The primary outcome is the Oswestry Disability Index. The secondary outcomes
      include a visual analogue scale and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey. They
      will be assessed at baseline, at the end of the intervention every month, and
      during 6 months and 9 months of follow-up by repeated measures analysis of
      variance. The significance level is 5%. The safety of Tuina and health care
      education will be evaluated after each treatment session. This study will focus
      on the value of Tuina and health care education for low back pain and will
      highlight any differences in the efficacy of the treatments. Discussion: This
      study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tuina intervention for low back
      pain, which could provide reliable evidence for clinical decision making for
      patients with low back pain. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry,
      ChiCTR1900022656. Registered on 23 April 2019.

TI  - Evidence, theory and context: using intervention mapping in the development of a 
      community-based self-management program for chronic low back pain in a rural
      African primary care setting - the good back program.
LID - 343
AB  - Background: Rural Nigeria has one of the greatest burdens of low back pain but
      there are no effective evidence-based interventions to manage it in this
      population. This paper presents the application of the intervention mapping (IM) 
      approach in the development of a complex behavior change intervention – The Good 
      Back program, aimed at reducing non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP)
      disability in rural Nigeria. Methods: The first four steps of IM were applied. A 
      critical review of the literature, 2 qualitative studies and a population-based
      cross-sectional study in rural Nigeria helped to identify two key program
      objectives in order to reduce CLBP disability in this population: reduce the
      impact of illness perceptions, fear avoidance beliefs, catastrophising, anxiety
      and depression by targeting maladaptive illness perceptions about CLBP; and
      facilitate the adoption of exercises and good posture to limit disability. A
      systematic review plus these studies, identified the personal and environmental
      determinants of the performance objectives including health literacy,
      self-awareness, self-efficacy, personal preference, health professional skills,
      health facility structure and family/community support. The theory, techniques
      and strategies for modifying personal and environmental determinants were also
      identified from these studies. Intervention components and materials were then
      produced for practical application. The initial developed intervention was
      described. Results: The feasibility and acceptability of the developed program
      was then tested using a small pragmatic non-randomised controlled study
      incorporating qualitative exit feedback interviews in a rural Nigerian primary
      health care centre. The program appeared feasible and acceptable when delivered
      by a highly trained physiotherapist. There were promising clinical outcomes in
      disability, pain intensity, illness perceptions, fear avoidance beliefs and pain 
      medication use. Suggestions for program improvement included shorter but ongoing 
      sessions, video demonstration of exercises/good posture, spacious
      exercise/demonstration rooms, and community legitimisation of exercise as
      treatment for back pain. Subsequent modifications to program content and delivery
      were then described. Theoretical modification included the addition of aspects of
      the social cognitive theory to the Leventhal’s self-regulatory model of illness
      cognitions. Conclusions: IM appears to be a suitable framework for designing
      complex behavior change interventions in rural Nigeria. The need for further
      testing of the intervention was highlighted.

      with ropivacaine alone and in combination with meloxicam in cats undergoing
      ovariohysterectomy.
LID - 88
AB  - Background: Infiltration of the surgical site with local anesthetics combined
      with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may play an important role in improving
      perioperative pain control. This prospective, randomized, blinded, controlled
      clinical trial aimed to evaluate intraoperative isoflurane requirements,
      postoperative analgesia, and adverse events of infiltration of the surgical site 
      with ropivacaine alone and combined with meloxicam in cats undergoing
      ovariohysterectomy. Forty-five cats premedicated with acepromazine/meperidine and
      anesthetized with propofol/isoflurane were randomly distributed into three
      treatments (n = 15 per group): physiological saline (group S), ropivacaine alone 
      (1 mg/kg, group R) or combined with meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg, group RM) infiltrated
      at the surgical site (incision line, ovarian pedicles and uterus). End-tidal
      isoflurane concentration (FE’ISO), recorded at specific time points during
      surgery, was adjusted to inhibit autonomic responses to surgical stimulation.
      Pain was assessed using an Interactive Visual Analog Scale (IVAS), UNESP-Botucatu
      Multidimensional Composite Pain Scale (MCPS), and mechanical nociceptive
      thresholds (MNT) up to 24 h post-extubation. Rescue analgesia was provided with
      intramuscular morphine (0.1 mg/kg) when MCPS was ≥6. Results: Area under the
      curve (AUC) of FE’ISO was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in the RM (17.8 ± 3.1)
      compared to S (23.1 ± 2.2) and R groups (22.8 ± 1.1). Hypertension (systolic
      arterial pressure > 160 mmHg) coinciding with surgical manipulation was observed 
      only in cats treated with S and R (4/15 cats, P = 0.08). The number of cats
      receiving rescue analgesia (4 cats in the S group and 1 cat in the R and RM
      groups) did not differ among groups (P = 0.17). The AUC of IVAS, MCPS and MNT did
      not differ among groups (P = 0.56, 0.64, and 0.18, respectively). Significantly
      lower IVAS pain scores were recorded at 1 h in the RM compared to the R and S
      groups (P = 0.021–0.018). There were no significant adverse effects during the
      study period. Conclusions: Local infiltration with RM decreased intraoperative
      isoflurane requirements and resulted in some evidence of improved analgesia
      during the early postoperative period. Neither R nor RM infiltration appeared to 
      result in long term analgesia in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy.

TI  - First line in psychiatric emergency: pre-hospital emergency protocol for mental
      disorders in Iran.
LID - 19
AB  - Introduction: This article is a report of designing a rapid and effective guide
      for paramedics who take care of patients in a pre-hospital setting to answer
      developing demands. Methods: The relevant literature was reviewed, and the topics
      were extracted. Then, the extracted items were discussed in an expert panel.
      Finally, items were discussed in a meeting including emergency technicians and
      emergency technical assistants to identify implementation problems. Results:
      Important topics for managing psychiatric patients were categorized at three
      levels: 1) Patient safety and security issues, 2) Patient status assessment and
      diagnosis, and 3) Patient management (medical, behavioral management, and
      referral to a treatment center). Discussion: This protocol can be a solution to
      improve emergency technician training. Such summarized protocols can be used for 
      rapid review immediately before exposing a patient with an acute psychiatric
      condition. Due to specific cultural and different access to medicines in Iran,
      some issues are different.

TI  - Medication assisted treatment (MAT) in criminal justice settings as a
      double-edged sword: balancing novel addiction treatments and voluntary
      participation.
LID - 7
AB  - Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) provides an opportunity to address opioid
      addiction among justice-involved individuals, an often difficult to reach
      population. This potential has been increasingly recognized by agencies,
      policymakers and pharmaceutical companies. The result has been a marked increase 
      in the number of drug courts, prisons and agencies in which MAT, notably with
      long-acting injectable medications, is offered. While this is a positive
      development, ensuring that vulnerable individuals are in a position voluntarily
      participation within the complex criminal justice environment is necessary. The
      unequal authority and agency inherent in the nature of these environments should 
      be recognized. Therefore, rigorous protections, mirroring the goals of the
      consent processes required for medical or sociobehavorial research, should be
      employed when MAT is offered to protect individual autonomy.

TI  - Assessment and prioritization of the WHO “best buys” and other recommended
      interventions for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases in
      Iran.
LID - 333
AB  - Background: The WHO’s “best buys” and other recommended interventions are a menu 
      of policy options and cost-effective interventions for the prevention and control
      of major noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The menu has six objectives,
      implementing which by member states is expected to promote the achievement of the
      nine NCD targets by 2025. In line with their context, countries can select from
      the menu of best buys and other recommended interventions. Iran adopted its
      national action plan on NCDs, 2015, including global as well as some specific
      goals and targets. This study had two objectives: analyzing the gaps to reach the
      national targets on NCDs; and prioritizing the best buys and other recommended
      interventions based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDA) method for the
      context of Iran. Methods: This is a mixed-methods study. We used qualitative
      textual evidence (documentary content analysis) and MCDA for prioritization of
      interventions based on five criteria, including a number of people to be
      potentially affected by the intervention, cost-effectiveness of the intervention,
      attributable burden (DALY per 100,000), hospitalization and variations among
      income levels. Data related to five criteria for each intervention were extracted
      from national studies and relevant international organizations. The weight of
      each criterion determines based on the opinions of national experts. Results: Out
      of 105 actions and interventions recommended by WHO, only 12 of them were not on 
      the national agenda in Iran, while the six missed interventions were related to
      objective number 4. Only one of the best buys Group’s interventions was not
      targeted (vaccination against human papillomavirus, two doses of 9–13-year-old
      girls), for which arrangements are being made for the implementation. Encouraging
      and educating healthy dietary habits and increasing public awareness about the
      side effects of smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke, e.g., through mass
      media campaigns, are among the interventions in need of serious prioritization.
      The priority of interventions was independently calculated in the area of risk
      factors and clinical preventive interventions. Conclusion: Due to limited
      resources, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) need to identify and
      prioritize more cost-effective and more equitable interventions to combat the NCD
      epidemic. Based on our findings, we advocate more investment in the mass and
      social media campaigns to promote a healthy diet, avoid tobacco use, as well as
      the inclusion of some effective clinical preventive interventions into the
      national action plan, along the long pathway to tackle NCDs and ultimately reach 
      sustainable health development in Iran. The use of the MCDA approach assisted us 
      in formulating a simultaneous use of efficiency and equity, and other indices for
      prioritizing the interventions.

      adolescents.
LID - 30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate socio-demographic, family and behavioral factors associated
      with oral health literacy (OHL) in adolescents. METHODS: Cross-sectional study
      conducted with adolescents aged 15 to 19 years in Campina Grande, Brazil.
      Parents/guardians answered a questionnaire addressing socio-demographic data. The
      adolescents answered validated instruments on family cohesion and adaptability
      (family adaptability and cohesion evaluation scale), drug use (alcohol, smoking
      and substance involvement screening test), type of dental service used for last
      appointment and OHL (Brazilian version of the Rapid Estimate of Oral Health
      Literacy in Dentistry). Two dentists were trained to evaluate OHL (K =
      0.87–0.88). Descriptive analysis was performed, followed by Poisson regression
      analysis (α = 5%). A directed acyclic graph was used to select independent
      variables in the study. RESULTS: The following variables remained associated with
      better OHL: high mother’s schooling level (RR = 1.07; 95%CI: 1.03–1.12), high
      income (RR = 1.04; 95%CI: 1.01–1.09), white ethnicity/skin color (RR = 1.05;
      95%CI: 1.01–1.10), married parents (RR = 1.04; 95%CI: 1.01–1.09), “enmeshed”
      family cohesion (RR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.12–1.30), “structured” (RR = 1.06; 95%CI:
      1.01–1.12) or “rigid” (RR = 1.11; 95%CI: 1.04–1.19) family adaptability, having
      more than five residents in the home (RR = 1.07; 95%CI: 1.01–1.14) and having
      used a private dental service during the last appointment (RR = 1.08; 95%CI:
      1.03–1.13). CONCLUSION: Family functioning and socio-demographic factors
      influence the level of oral health literacy among adolescents.

TI  - Outcome reporting in neonates experiencing withdrawal following opioid exposure
      in pregnancy: a systematic review.
LID - 262
AB  - Background: Neonatal withdrawal secondary to in utero opioid exposure is a
      growing global concern stressing the psychosocial well-being of affected families
      and scarce hospital resources. In the ongoing search for the most effective
      treatment, randomized controlled trials are indispensable. Consistent outcome
      selection and measurement across randomized controlled trials enables synthesis
      of results, fostering the translation of research into practice. Currently, there
      is no core outcome set to standardize outcome selection, definition and
      reporting. This study identifies the outcomes currently reported in the
      literature for neonates experiencing withdrawal following opioid exposure during 
      pregnancy. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and
      Cochrane Central was conducted to identify all primary research studies
      (randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, case-controlled studies,
      uncontrolled trials, observational cohort studies, clinical practice guidelines
      and case reports) reporting outcomes for interventions used to manage neonatal
      abstinence syndrome between July 2007 and July 2017. All “primary” and
      “secondary” neonatal outcomes were extracted by two independent reviewers and
      were assigned to one of OMERACT’s core areas of “pathophysiological
      manifestation”, “life impact”, “resource use”, “adverse events”, or “death”.
      Results: Forty-seven primary research articles reporting 107 “primary” and 127
      “secondary” outcomes were included. The most frequently reported outcomes were
      “duration of pharmacotherapy” (68% of studies, N = 32), “duration of hospital
      stay” (66% of studies, N = 31) and “withdrawal symptoms” (51% of studies,
      N = 24). The discrepancy between the number of times an outcome was reported and 
      the number of articles was secondary to the use of composite outcomes. Frequently
      reported outcomes had heterogeneous definitions or were not defined by the study 
      and were measured at different times. Outcomes reported in the literature to date
      were mainly assigned to the core areas “pathophysiologic manifestations” or
      “resource use”. No articles reported included parent or former patient
      involvement in outcome selections. Conclusions: Inconsistent selection and
      definition of primary and secondary outcomes exists in the present literature of 
      pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for managing opioid withdrawal
      in neonates. No studies involved parents in the process of outcome selection.
      These findings hinder evidence synthesis to generate clinically meaningful
      practice guidelines. The development of a specific core outcome set is
      imperative.

TI  - Remifentanil patient-controlled versus epidural analgesia on intrapartum maternal
      fever: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 151
AB  - Background: Intravenous remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia (RPCA) is an
      alternative for epidural analgesia (EA) in labor pain relief. However, it remains
      unknown whether RPCA is superior to EA in decreasing the risk of intrapartum
      maternal fever during labor. Methods: According to the Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review
      and meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to April 2019. All
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the risk of intrapartum
      maternal fever with RPCA compared with EA alone or EA in combination with spinal 
      analgesia during labor were included. Results: A total of 825 studies were
      screened, and 6 RCTs including 3341 patients were identified. Compared with EA,
      RPCA was associated with a significantly lower incidence of intrapartum maternal 
      fever (risk ratio [RR] 0.48, P = 0.02, I2 = 49%) during labor analgesia. After
      excluding 2 trials via the heterogeneity analysis, there was no difference in the
      incidence of intrapartum fever between patients receiving RPCA and those
      receiving EA. Satisfaction with pain relief during labor was lower in the RPCA
      group than that in the EA group (− 10.6 [13.87, − 7.44], P < 0.00001, I2 = 0%).
      The incidence of respiratory depression was significantly greater in the RPCA
      group than that in the EA group (risk ratio 2.86 [1.65, 4.96], P = 0.0002,
      I2 = 58%). The incidence of Apgar scores < 7 at 5 min in the RPCA group was
      equivalent to that in the EA group. Conclusion: There is no solid evidence to
      illustrate that the incidence of intrapartum maternal fever is lower in patients 
      receiving intravenous RPCA than in patients receiving EA.

TI  - The challenge of safe anesthesia in developing countries: defining the problems
      in a medical center in Cambodia.
LID - 204
AB  - Background: The International Standards for a Safe Practice of Anesthesia (ISSPA)
      were developed on behalf of the World Federation of Societies of
      Anaesthesiologists and the World Health Organization. It has been recommend as an
      assessment tool that allows anesthetic providers in developing countries to
      assess their compliance and needs. This study was performed to describe the
      anesthesia service in one main public hospital during an 8-month medical mission 
      in Cambodia and evaluate its anesthetic safety issues according to the ISSPA.
      Methods: We conduct a retrospective study involving 1953 patients at the Preah
      Ket Mealea hospital. Patient demographics, anesthetic techniques, and
      complications were reviewed according to the registers of the anesthetic services
      and questionnaires. The inadequacies in personnel, facilities, equipment,
      medications, and conduct of anesthesia drugs were recorded using a checklist
      based on the ISSPA. Results: A total of 1792 patients received general and
      regional anesthesia in the operating room, while 161 patients receiving sedation 
      for gastroscopy. The patients’ mean age was 45.0 ± 16.6 years (range,
      17–87 years). The three most common surgical procedures were abdominal (52.0%;
      confidence interval [CI], 49.3–54.7), orthopedic (27.6%; CI, 25.2–29.9), and
      urological surgery (14.7%; CI, 12.8–16.6). General anesthesia, spinal anesthesia,
      and brachial plexus block were performed in 54.3% (CI, 51.7–56.8), 28.2% (CI,
      25.9–30.5), and 9.4% (CI, 7.9–10.9) of patients, respectively. One death
      occurred. Twenty-six items related to professional aspects, monitoring, and
      conduct of anesthesia did not meet the ISSPA-recommended standards. A lack of
      commonly used drugs and monitoring equipment was noted, posing major threats to
      the safety of anesthesia practice, especially in emergency situations.
      Conclusions: This study adds to the scarce literature on anesthesia practice in
      low- and middle-income countries such as Cambodia. Future medical assistance
      should help to strengthen these countries’ inadequacies, allowing for the
      adoption of international standards for the safe practice of anesthesia.

TI  - Association of Alcohol Screening Scores With Adverse Mental Health Conditions and
      Substance Use Among US Adults.
LID - e200895
AB  - Question: Can alcohol use screening scores provide clinically meaningful
      information and facilitate identification of adverse mental health conditions and
      other substance use? Findings: This cohort study using data from 6431 US patients
      collected from 2003 to 2012 found that high alcohol use scores (Alcohol Use
      Disorders Identification Test score ≥20) were associated with depression,
      anxiety, crack or cocaine use, and other stimulant use, with likelihood ratios
      greater than 3.5. Meaning: These findings suggest that alcohol screening can
      inform decisions about further screening and diagnostic assessment for
      depression, anxiety, and some drug use outcomes.

TI  - Highly-selective µ-opioid receptor antagonism does not block L-DOPA-induced
      dyskinesia in a rodent model.
LID - 149
AB  - Objectives: Dopamine-replacement utilizing L-DOPA is still the mainstay treatment
      for Parkinson’s disease (PD), but often leads to development of L-DOPA-induced
      dyskinesia (LID), which can be as debilitating as the motor deficits. There is
      currently no satisfactory pharmacological adjunct therapy. The endogenous opioid 
      peptides enkephalin and dynorphin are important co-transmitters in the direct and
      indirect striatofugal pathways and have been implicated in genesis and expression
      of LID. Opioid receptor antagonists and agonists with different selectivity
      profiles have been investigated for anti-dyskinetic potential in preclinical
      models. In this study we investigated effects of the highly-selective μ-opioid
      receptor antagonist CTAP (> 1200-fold selectivity for μ- over δ-opioid receptors)
      and a novel glycopeptide congener (gCTAP5) that was glycosylated to increase
      stability, in the standard rat LID model. Results: Intraperitoneal administration
      (i.p.) of either 0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg CTAP and gCTAP5 completely blocked
      morphine’s antinociceptive effect (10 mg/kg; i.p.) in the warm water tail-flick
      test, showing in vivo activity in rats after systemic injection. Neither
      treatment with CTAP (10 mg/kg; i.p.), nor gCTAP5 (5 mg/kg; i.p.) had any effect
      on L-DOPA-induced limb, axial, orolingual, or locomotor abnormal involuntary
      movements. The data indicate that highly-selective μ-opioid receptor antagonism
      alone might not be sufficient to be anti-dyskinetic.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common cause of pain and
      poor quality of life for those undergoing treatment for cancer and those
      surviving cancer. Many advances have been made in the pre-clinical science;
      despite this, these findings have not been translated into novel preventative
      measures and treatments for CIPN. This review aims to give an update on the
      pre-clinical science, preventative measures, assessment and treatment of CIPN.

TI  - Epidemiological and geospatial profile of the prescription opioid crisis in Ohio,
      United States.
LID - 4341
AB  - The underlying reasons behind the unprecedented increase of the mortality rates
      due to the opioid epidemics in the United States are still not fully uncovered.
      Most efforts have been focused on targeting opioids, but there is little
      information about vulnerable populations at high risk of opioid abuse and death. 
      In this study, we used data from the Ohio Department of Health for deaths caused 
      by prescription opioids from 2010–2017 to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of 
      the opioid overdose epidemic. Our results showed a rapid increase in prescription
      opioid death rates among the white male population aged 30–39 but also a
      considerable increase among the black male population with an exponential growth 
      trend. Our geospatial analysis suggests that the increasing rates of the opioid
      overdose epidemic in Ohio were driven by the epidemic hotspot areas. Our findings
      highlight the relevance of prioritizing public health measures targeting specific
      locations and vulnerable populations to mitigate the current opioids crisis.

      Pain: A Health Technology Assessment.
PG  - 1-109
AB  - Background: Chronic pain is costly for patients and for the health care system.
      It negatively affects people's physical, emotional, social, and mental health. We
      conducted a health technology assessment of 10-kHz high-frequency spinal cord
      stimulation (SCS) in adults with chronic noncancer pain that was refractory to
      medical management, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety,
      cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency
      SCS, and patient preferences and values. Methods: We performed a systematic
      literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each 
      included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias and ROBINS-I tools and the quality
      of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
      Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a
      systematic economic literature search. We analyzed the 5-year budget impact of
      publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in Ontario for adults with chronic
      noncancer pain who had already tried other available SCS therapies (up to 1.2
      kHz). To contextualize the potential value of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS, we spoke
      with people who had chronic noncancer pain. Results: We included 5 studies (7
      publications) in the clinical evidence review. Overall, 10-kHz high-frequency SCS
      likely provides reductions in pain intensity and functional disability, and
      improvements in quality of life in people with chronic noncancer pain (GRADE:
      Moderate). As well, patients may reduce their opioid consumption with 10-kHz
      high-frequency SCS (GRADE: Low). The two included economic evaluations found that
      10-kHz high-frequency SCS was cost-saving compared with conventional SCS, but
      neither was applicable to the Ontario context. Owing to limited evidence about
      the effectiveness of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in people who have first tried and
      failed SCS at lower frequencies (up to 1.2 kHz), we did not conduct a
      cost-effectiveness analysis comparing this pathway of care and 10-kHz
      high-frequency SCS for Ontario. Publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency SCS (using
      the Freedom SCS system) in Ontario over the next 5 years would lead to a total
      net cost savings of $0.73 million (ranging from about $0.10 million in year 1 to 
      about $0.21 million in year 5). However, if the province outsourced this therapy 
      using the Senza HF10 SCS system, the total 5-year budget impact would be about
      $8.76 million. The people we spoke with who had chronic noncancer pain reported
      that their pain had a substantial negative impact on their activities and
      emotional well-being. Their direct knowledge of different pain therapies allowed 
      them to provide context and comparisons when they discussed the impact of SCS on 
      their chronic pain. Conclusions: For adults with chronic noncancer pain that was 
      refractory to medical management, 10-kHz high-frequency SCS was effective in
      relieving pain, reducing disability, and improving quality of life. Because there
      was limited evidence about the effectiveness of 10-kHz high-frequency SCS in
      people who had first tried and failed SCS at lower frequencies (up to 1.2 kHz),
      we were unable to determine whether 10-kHz high-frequency SCS is cost-effective
      in the Ontario context. We estimate that publicly funding 10-kHz high-frequency
      SCS in Ontario would result in cost savings of about $0.10 million to $0.21
      million per year, for a potential total 5-year net cost savings of about $0.73
      million. Although people with chronic noncancer pain knew little about SCS before
      they received it, they reported that it reduced their level of chronic pain,
      leading to improvements in function and their ability to perform activities of
      daily living.

TI  - Inhaled Methoxyflurane versus Intravenous Morphine for Severe Trauma Pain in the 
      Emergency Setting: Subgroup Analysis of MEDITA, a Multicenter, Randomized,
      Controlled, Open-Label Trial.
PG  - 491-502
AB  - Purpose: Opioid analgesics remain the cornerstone of treatment for severe trauma 
      pain in the emergency setting, but there are barriers to their use. This post hoc
      analysis of a previously reported trial (MEDITA) investigated the efficacy and
      safety of low-dose methoxyflurane versus intravenous (IV) morphine for severe
      trauma pain. Patients and Methods: MEDITA was a Phase IIIb, randomized,
      active-controlled, parallel-group, open-label study in Italian pre-hospital units
      and emergency departments (EudraCT: 2017-001565-25; NCT03585374). Adult patients 
      (N=272) with moderate-to-severe trauma pain (score ≥4 on the Numerical Rating
      Scale [NRS]) were randomized 1:1 to inhaled methoxyflurane (3 mL) or standard
      analgesic treatment (SAT; IV paracetamol 1g or ketoprofen 100mg for moderate pain
      [NRS 4–6] and IV morphine 0.1mg/kg for severe pain [NRS ≥7]). Analyses were
      performed for the severe pain subgroup. The primary efficacy variable was the
      overall change from baseline in visual analog scale (VAS) pain intensity at 3, 5 
      and 10min post-randomization. Non-inferiority of methoxyflurane versus morphine
      was concluded if the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment
      difference was <1; superiority was concluded if the upper 95% CI was <0. Results:
      Ninety-three patients (methoxyflurane: 49; SAT: 44) were included in the severe
      pain intention-to-treat population. The reduction in VAS pain intensity over the 
      first 10min was superior for methoxyflurane versus morphine (adjusted mean
      treatment difference: −5.54mm; 95% CI: −10.49, −0.59mm; p=0.029). Median time to 
      onset of pain relief was 9min for methoxyflurane and 15min for morphine. Patients
      rated treatment efficacy and physicians rated treatment practicality “Excellent” 
      or “Very good” for more methoxyflurane-treated patients (42.8% and 67.3%) than
      morphine-treated patients (18.1% and 22.8%). Adverse events, all non-serious,
      were reported in 20.4% of methoxyflurane-treated patients and in 4.8% of
      morphine-treated patients. Conclusion: Methoxyflurane provided superior
      short-term pain relief to IV morphine in patients with severe trauma pain and
      offers an effective non-narcotic treatment option.

TI  - Social media as an emerging tool for reducing prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors.
LID - e03471
AB  - Interventions are urgently needed to reduce prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors, including anxiety and concomitant use of sedatives. However, only a
      limited number of randomized controlled opioid intervention trials have been
      conducted. We sought to determine whether an online behavior change/support
      community, compared to a control Facebook group, could reduce anxiety and opioid 
      misuse among chronic pain patients. 51 high-risk non-cancer chronic pain patients
      were randomly assigned to either a Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE)
      peer-led online behavior change intervention or a control group (no peer leaders)
      on Facebook for 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria were: 18 years or older, a UCLA
      Health System patient, prescribed an opioid for non-cancer chronic pain between 3
      and 12 months ago, and a score of ≥9 on the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) 
      and/or concomitant use of benzodiazepines. Participation in the online community 
      was voluntary. Patients completed baseline and follow-up assessments on
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder screener (GAD-7), COMM, and frequency of social
      media discussions about pain and opioid use. Compared to control group
      participants, intervention participants showed a baseline-to-follow-up decrease
      in anxiety, and more frequently used social media to discuss pain, prescription
      opioid use, coping strategies, places to seek help, and alternative therapies for
      pain. Both groups showed a baseline to follow-up decrease in COMM score.
      Preliminary results support the use an online community interventions as a
      low-cost tool to decrease risk for prescription opioid misuse and its
      complications.

TI  - Pathway-specific enzymes from bamboo and crop leaves biosynthesize
      anti-nociceptive C-glycosylated flavones.
LID - 110
AB  - C-glycosylated flavones (CGFs) are promising candidates as anti-nociceptive
      compounds. The leaves of bamboo and related crops in the grass family are a
      largely unexploited bioresource with a wide array of CGFs. We report here
      pathway-specific enzymes including C-glycosyltransferases (CGTs) and P450
      hydroxylases from cereal crops and bamboo species accumulating abundant CGFs.
      Mining of CGTs and engineering of P450s that decorate the flavonoid skeleton
      allowed the production of desired CGFs (with yield of 20–40 mg/L) in an
      Escherichia coli cell factory. We further explored the antinociceptive activity
      of major CGFs in mice models and identified isoorientin as the most potent, with 
      both neuroanalgesic and anti-inflammatory effects superior to clinical drugs such
      as rotundine and aspirin. Our discovery of the pain-alleviating flavonoids
      elicited from bamboo and crop leaves establishes this previously underutilized
      source, and sheds light on the pathway and pharmacological mechanisms of the
      compounds.

TI  - Efficacy of local infiltration analgesia with ropivacaine for postoperative pain 
      management in cervical laminoplasty: a retrospective study.
LID - 4217
AB  - Poor postoperative pain control impairs patient recovery and lengthens the
      duration of hospitalization after various surgeries. Local infiltration
      analgesia(LIA) has become an effective method for managing postoperative pain.
      This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of LIA with ropivacaine for
      postoperative pain control after cervical laminoplasty. In total, 68 patients
      undergoing cervical laminoplasty were included for retrospective review and
      divided into ropivacaine and control groups. The visual analogue scale (VAS)
      score, postoperative analgesic consumption, operative duration, intraoperative
      blood loss volume, incision length, hospitalization duration and incidence of
      complications were analyzed. In the ropivacaine group, the VAS score was
      3.2 ± 1.4 at 4 hours postoperatively, which was lower than that of the control
      group(4.0 ± 1.4, P = 0.024). At 8, 12 and 24 hours after surgery, a significant
      difference was detected in the VAS score between the two groups(P ≤ 0.015).
      Sufentanil consumption was less in the ropivacaine group than in the control
      group in the first 4 hours postoperatively (25.6 ± 6.3 µg vs 32.2 ± 6.8 µg,
      P < 0.001), and similar results were observed in the first 8, 12, 24, 48 and
      72 hours postoperatively(P < 0.001). Fewer patients required rescue analgesia in 
      the ropivacaine group(8/33 vs 18/35 at 4–8 hours, P = 0.021; 9/33 vs 21/35 at
      8–12 hours, P = 0.007). The hospitalization duration and time to ambulation were 
      shorter in the ropivacaine group(8.5 ± 1.4 vs 9.6 ± 1.6 for postoperative
      duration, P = 0.002; 2.9 ± 0.7 vs 3.5 ± 0.8 for time to ambulation, P = 0.001).
      The incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower in the ropivacaine group than in
      the control group(30.3% vs 54.3%, P = 0.046). In conclusion, LIA with ropivacaine
      could effectively reduce postoperative pain, and postoperative analgesic
      consumption, and promote recovery after cervical laminoplasty.

TI  - Continuous wound infiltration versus epidural analgesia for midline abdominal
      incisions – a randomized-controlled pilot trial (Painless-Pilot trial; DRKS
      Number: DRKS00008023).
LID - e0229898
AB  - Objectives: To test the feasibility of a randomized controlled study design
      comparing epidural analgesia (EDA) with continuous wound infiltration (CWI) in
      respect to postoperative complications and mobility to design a future
      multicentre randomized controlled trial. Design, setting, participants: CWI has
      been developed to address drawbacks of EDA. Previous studies have established the
      equivalent analgesic potential of CWI compared to EDA. This is a single centre,
      non-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial at a tertiary surgical centre.
      Patients undergoing elective non-colorectal surgery via a midline laparotomy were
      randomized to EDA or CWI. Endpoints included recruitment, feasibility of
      assessing postoperative mobility with a pedometer and morbidity. No primary
      endpoint was defined and all analyses were explorative. Interventions: CWI with
      local anaesthetics (experimental group) vs. thoracic EDA (control). Results: Of
      846 patients screened within 14 months, 71 were randomized and 62 (31 per group) 
      included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Mobility was assessed in 44 of 62
      patients and revealed no differences within the first 3 postoperative days.
      Overall morbidity did not differ between the two groups (measured via the
      comprehensive complication index). Median pain scores at rest were comparable
      between the two groups, while EDA was superior in pain treatment during movement 
      on the first, but not on the second and third postoperative day. Duration of
      preoperative induction of anaesthesia was shorter with CWI than with EDA. Of 17
      serious adverse events, 3 were potentially related to EDA, while none was related
      to CWI. Conclusion: This trial confirmed the feasibility of a randomized trial
      design to compare CWI and EDA regarding morbidity. Improvements in the education 
      and training of team members are necessary to improve recruitment. Trial
      registration: DRKS00008023.

TI  - The protocol for a multisite, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
      of axillary nerve stimulation for chronic shoulder pain.
LID - 248
AB  - Background: Shoulder impingement syndrome is one of the most common causes of
      shoulder pain, accounting for approximately 30% of all shoulder pain.
      Approximately 35% of patients with shoulder impingement syndrome are refractory
      to conservative treatment. For patients who fail conservative treatment, there is
      no established treatment to successfully treat their chronic pain. Prior
      randomized control trials have demonstrated efficacy for the use of a single lead
      intramuscular peripheral nerve stimulation of the axillary nerve at the motor
      points of the deltoid muscle for treatment of hemiplegic shoulder pain. This is
      the first controlled trial to utilize the same novel technology to treat shoulder
      impingement syndrome outside of the stroke population. Methods: This is a
      dual-site, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized control trial.
      Participants will be randomized to two treatment groups. The intervention group
      will be treated with active peripheral nerve stimulation of the axillary nerve of
      the affected shoulder and the control group will be treated with sham peripheral 
      nerve stimulation of the axillary nerve of the affected shoulder. Both groups
      will receive a standardized exercise therapy program directed by a licensed
      therapist. Discussion: This study protocol will allow the investigators to
      determine if this novel, non-pharmacologic treatment of shoulder pain can
      demonstrate the same benefit in musculoskeletal patients which has been
      previously demonstrated in the stroke population. Trial registration:

TI  - Effects of ultrasound-guided paravertebral block on MMP-9 and postoperative pain 
      in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
LID - 59
AB  - Background: Local anesthesia can reduce the response to surgical stress and
      decrease the consumption of opioids, which may reduce immunosuppression and
      potentially delay postoperative tumor recurrence. We compared paravertebral block
      (PVB) combined with general anesthesia (GA) and general anesthesia regarding
      their effects on postoperative pain and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) after 
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Methods: 54 patients
      undergoing elective VATS lobectomy at a single tertiary care, teaching hospital
      located in Qingdao between May 2, 2018 and Sep 28, 2018 were randomised by
      computer to either paravertebral block combined with general anesthesia or
      general anesthesia. The primary outcomes were pain scores at rest and on cough at
      1, 4, 24, and 48 h after surgery. The secondary outcome were plasma
      concentrations of MMP-9, complications, and length of postoperative hospital
      stay. Results: 75 were enrolled to the study, of whom 21 were excluded before
      surgery. We analyzed lobectomy patients undergoing paravertebral block combined
      with general anesthesia (n = 25) or general anesthesia (n = 24). Both groups were
      similar regarding baseline characteristics. Pain scores at rest at 4 h and 24 h, 
      on cough at 4 h were lower in PVB/GA group, compared with GA group (P < 0.05).
      There were no difference in pain scores at rest at 1 h, 48 h and on cough at 1 h,
      24 h, and 48 h between groups. Patients in the PVB/GA group showed a greater
      decrease in plasma MMP-9 level at T1 and T2 after VATS lobectomy (P < 0.05).
      Postoperative complications and length of stay did not differ by anesthetic
      technique. Conclusions: The paravertebral block/general anesthesia can provide
      statistically better pain relief and attenuate MMP-9 response to surgery and
      after VATS lobectomy. This technique may be beneficial for patients to recover
      rapidly after lung surgery and reduce postoperative tumor recurrence. Trial

TI  - Factors Associated with Life Satisfaction in Older Adults with Chronic Pain
      (PainS65+).
PG  - 475-89
AB  - Background: Chronic pain in later life is a worldwide problem. In younger
      patients, chronic pain affects life satisfaction negatively; however, it is
      unknown whether this outcome will extend into old age. Objective: This study
      examines which factors determine life satisfaction in older adults who suffer
      from chronic pain with respect to socio-demographics, lifestyle behaviors, pain, 
      and comorbidities. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited a random sample 
      of people ≥65 years old living in south-eastern Sweden (N= 6611). A postal survey
      addressed pain aspects and health experiences. Three domains from the Life
      Satisfaction Questionnaire (LiSat-11) were used to capture the individual’s
      estimations of overall satisfaction (LiSat-life), somatic health
      (LiSat-somhealth), and psychological health (LiSat-psychhealth). Results:
      Respondents with chronic pain (2790, 76.2±7.4 years old) rated lower on life
      satisfaction than those without chronic pain, with medium effect size (ES) on
      LiSat-somhealth (r = 0.38, P < 0.001) and small ES on the other two domains (r < 
      0.3). Among the respondents with chronic pain, severe pain (OR 0.29–0.59) and
      pain spreading (OR 0.87–0.95) were inversely associated with all three domains of
      the LiSat-11. Current smoking, alcohol overconsumption, and obesity negatively
      affected one or more domains of the LiSat-11. Most comorbidities were negatively 
      related to LiSat-somhealth, and some comorbidities affected the other two
      domains. For example, having tumour or cancer negatively affected both LiSat-life
      (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44–0.88) and LiSat-somhealth (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24–0.74).
      Anxiety or depression disorders had a negative relationship both for LiSat-life
      (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38–0.78) and LiSat-psychhealth (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06–0.14).
      Conclusion: Older adults with chronic pain reported lower life satisfaction but
      the difference from their peers without chronic pain was trivial, except for
      satisfaction with somatic health. Pain management in old age needs to consider
      comorbidities and severe pain to improve patients’ life satisfaction.

TI  - Immune-mediated febrile response in female rats: Role of central hypothalamic
      mediators.
LID - 4073
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces fever through cytokines like receptor-activator 
      of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), triggering mediators like prostaglandins
      (PG), endothelin-1 (ET-1), corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), substance P
      (SP) and endogenous opioids. LPS-induced fever is reduced in females compared
      with males except in ovariectomized (OVX) females which show increased fever
      mediated by PG. The present study aimed to identify the mediators involved in
      fever in intact and OVX female rats. Fever was induced with LPS (50 μg/kg)
      intraperitoneally or CRF (2.5 μg), ET-1 (1 pg), morphine (10 μg) and SP (500 ng) 
      intracerebroventricularly in sham-operated and OVX rats. The role of RANKL was
      evaluated with osteoprotegerin (OPG, 1 μg, intracerebroventricularly). Expression
      of RANK, CRFI/II, ETB, μ-opioid (MOR) and NK1 receptors was evaluated by confocal
      microscopy. Besides LPS, only morphine induced fever in OVX rats while all
      mediators induced fever in sham-operated animals. OPG abolished LPS-induced fever
      in OVX but not sham-operated animals. Overall, fever involves similar central
      mediators in cycling females and males but only morphine induced fever in OVX
      females. Importantly, RANK/RANKL participates in LPS-induced fever in OVX
      females, as in males but not in cycling females.

TI  - Prevalence and Correlates of Caffeine Use Disorder Symptoms Among a United States
      Sample.
PG  - 4-11
AB  - Background: The DSM-5 recognizes caffeine use disorder as a condition for further
      study, but there is a need to better understand its prevalence and clinical
      significance among the general population.Methods: A survey was conducted among
      an online sample of 1006 caffeine-consuming adults using demographic quotas to
      reflect the U.S. population. Caffeine consumption, DSM-proposed criteria for
      caffeine use disorder, sleep, substance use, and psychological distress were
      assessed.Results: Eight percent of the sample fulfilled DSM-proposed criteria for
      caffeine use disorder. These individuals consumed more caffeine, were younger,
      and were more likely to be cigarette smokers. Fulfilling caffeine use disorder
      criteria was associated with caffeine-related functional impairment, poorer
      sleep, some substance use, as well as greater depression, anxiety, and
      stress.Conclusions: The prevalence of caffeine use disorder among the present
      sample suggests that the proposed diagnostic criteria would identify only a
      modest percentage of the general population, and that identified individuals
      experience significant caffeine-related distress.

LID - 92
AB  - Zerumbone has shown great potential in various pathophysiological models of
      diseases, particularly in neuropathic pain conditions. Further understanding the 
      mechanisms of action is important to develop zerumbone as a potential
      anti-nociceptive agent. Numerous receptors and pathways function to inhibit and
      modulate transmission of pain signals. Previously, we demonstrated involvement of
      the serotonergic system in zerumbone’s anti-neuropathic effects. The present
      study was conducted to determine zerumbone’s modulatory potential involving
      noradrenergic, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in chronic constriction injury
      (CCI)-induced in vitro and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced SH-SY5Y in vitro
      neuroinflammatory models. von Frey filament and Hargreaves plantar tests were
      used to assess allodynia and hyperalgesia in the chronic constriction
      injury-induced neuropathic pain mouse model. Involvement of specific
      adrenoceptors were investigated using antagonists— prazosin (α1-adrenoceptor
      antagonist), idazoxan (α2-adrenoceptor antagonist), metoprolol (β1-adrenoceptor
      antagonist), ICI 118,551 (β2-adrenoceptor antagonist), and SR 59230 A
      (β3-adrenoceptor antagonist), co-administered with zerumbone (10 mg/kg).
      Involvement of excitatory receptors; TRPV and NMDA were conducted using
      antagonists capsazepine (TRPV1 antagonist) and memantine (NMDA antagonist).
      Western blot was conducted to investigate the effect of zerumbone on the
      expression of α2A-adrenoceptor, TRPV1 and NMDA NR2B receptors in CCI-induced
      whole brain samples of mice as well as in LPS-induced SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
      cells. Pre-treatment with α1- and α2-adrenoceptor antagonists significantly
      attenuated both anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects of zerumbone. For
      β-adrenoceptors, only β2-adrenoceptor antagonist significantly reversed the
      anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects of zerumbone. β1-adrenoceptor
      antagonist only reversed the anti-allodynic effect of zerumbone. The
      anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects of zerumbone were both absent when
      TRPV1 and NMDA receptors were antagonized in both nociceptive assays. Zerumbone
      treatment markedly decreased the expression of α2A-adrenoceptor, while an
      up-regulation was observed of NMDA NR2B receptors. Expression of TRPV1 receptors 
      however did not significantly change. The in vitro study, representing a
      peripheral model, demonstrated the reduction of both NMDA NR2B and TRPV1
      receptors while significantly increasing α2A-adrenoceptor expression in contrast 
      to the brain samples. Our current findings suggest that the α1-, α2-, β1- and
      β2-adrenoceptors, TRPV1 and NMDA NR2B are essential for the anti-allodynic and
      antihyperalgesic effects of zerumbone. Alternatively, we demonstrated the
      plasticity of these receptors through their response to zerumbone’s
      administration.

TI  - Efficacy of a Single Intra-Articular HYMOVIS ONE Injection for Managing
      Symptomatic Hip Osteoarthritis: A 12-Month Follow-Up Retrospective Analysis of
      the ANTIAGE Register Data.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - Purpose: The use of ultrasound (US) guidance has allowed hip osteoarthritis to be
      treated with intra-articular (IA) injections. HYMOVIS ONE (HYADD4-G) is a new
      hyaluronic acid (HA) derivative product with unusual characteristics, and it has 
      been used with good results in knee osteoarthritis (OA). This study assessed the 
      efficacy and safety of a single HYMOVIS ONE injection in patients affected by
      symptomatic hip OA. Patients and Methods: This post-marketing cohort study
      assessed data from the ANTIAGE Register. Inclusion criteria were age ≥40 years,
      symptomatic hip OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade I–III) of ≥1-year duration, and ≥12
      months follow-up. All patients received a single HYMOVIS ONE (32 mg/4 mL)
      injection at baseline. Values for 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, 
      the Lequesne index, and nonsteroidal anti–inflammatory drug (NSAID) consumption
      were evaluated at 6 and 12 months. Adverse events were also recorded. Results:
      The included patients (n = 198) consisted of 42.5% women, with a mean (± SD) age 
      at baseline of 62 (± 14.2) years and a mean (± SD) body mass index of 26.3 (±
      2.5). The mean (SD) Lequesne index and VAS pain scores at baseline were 11.5 (±
      4.6) and 6.4 cm (± 2.2), respectively. All groups exhibited statistically
      significant reductions at all time points compared to baseline. At 12 months, the
      VAS pain score was reduced by 17.2%, the Lequesne index by 33.7%, and NSAID
      consumption by 41.7%. Conclusion: Our study supports the clinical efficacy and
      safety of a single HYMOVIS ONE injection for managing symptoms in patients with
      hip OA, confirming previous data on the use of HYMOVIS as a background therapy in
      the management of knee osteoarthritis.

TI  - Disentangling sensorimotor and cognitive cardioafferent effects: A
      cardiac-cycle-time study on spatial stimulus-response compatibility.
LID - 4059
AB  - Cardiac-cycle-time effects are attributed to variations in baroreceptor (BR)
      activity and have been shown to impinge on subcortical as well as cortical
      processes. However, cognitive and sensorimotor processes mediating voluntary
      responses seem to be differentially affected. We sought to disentangle
      cardiac-cycle-time effects on subcortical and cortical levels as well as
      sensorimotor and cognitive processes within a spatial
      stimulus-response-compatibility paradigm employing startling stimuli of different
      modalities. Air-puffs and white noise-bursts were presented unilaterally during
      either cardiac systole or diastole while bilateral startle EMG responses were
      recorded. Modality, laterality and cardiac-cycle-time were randomly varied
      within-subjects. Cognitive and sensorimotor stimulus-response-compatibility was
      orthogonally varied between-subjects: Participants (N = 80) responded to the
      stimuli via left/right button-push made with either the contra- or ipsilateral
      hand (sensorimotor compatibility) on either the ipsi- or contralateral button
      (cognitive compatibility). We found that sensorimotor compatible reactions were
      speeded during systole whereas sensorimotor incompatible ones were prolonged.
      This effect was independent of cognitive compatibility and restricted to auditory
      stimuli. Startle was inhibited during systole irrespective of modality or
      compatibility. Our results demonstrate how differential cardiac-cycle-time
      effects influence performance in conflict tasks and further suggest that
      stimulus-response-compatibility paradigms offer a viable method to uncover the
      complex interactions underlying behavioral BR effects.

TI  - Gene clustering and copy number variation in alkaloid metabolic pathways of opium
      poppy.
LID - 1190
AB  - Genes in plant secondary metabolic pathways enable biosynthesis of a range of
      medically and industrially important compounds, and are often clustered on
      chromosomes. Here, we study genomic clustering in the benzylisoquinoline alkaloid
      (BIA) pathway in opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), exploring relationships
      between gene expression, copy number variation, and metabolite production. We use
      Hi-C to improve the existing draft genome assembly, yielding chromosome-scale
      scaffolds that include 35 previously unanchored BIA genes. We find that
      co-expression of BIA genes increases within clusters and identify candidates with
      unknown function based on clustering and covariation in expression and alkaloid
      production. Copy number variation in critical BIA genes correlates with stark
      differences in alkaloid production, linking noscapine production with an 11-gene 
      deletion, and increased thebaine/decreased morphine production with deletion of a
      T6ODM cluster. Our results show that the opium poppy genome is still dynamically 
      evolving in ways that contribute to medically and industrially important
      phenotypes.

TI  - Using four different clinical tools as predictors for pain after total hip
      arthroplasty: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 57
AB  - Background: Treatment of postoperative pain remains a significant clinical
      problem, and prediction of patients with a risk of higher postoperative pain
      levels is an important focus. We aimed to identify patients undergoing total hip 
      arthroplasty (THA) with risk of higher pain levels at 24 h postoperatively by
      using four simple and easily available clinical tools. Methods: This prospective 
      observational cohort study included 102 patients having THA at Zealand University
      Hospital in Denmark. The following predictive tools were investigated for
      identifying patients with higher postoperative pain levels at 24 h
      postoperatively, both at rest and during mobilization: preoperative pain by
      peripheral venous cannulation (PVC) (dichotomized according to numerical rating
      scale pain ≤ 2/> 2 (PVC-Low/PVC-High) (primary outcome); the post anesthesia care
      unit (PACU) nurses’ expectations of patients pain levels; patients early pain
      levels at the PACU; and patients own forecast of postoperative pain levels. The
      Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze comparisons between prediction groups.
      For the primary outcome we considered a p-value < 0.01 as statistically
      significant and for other outcomes a p-value of 0.05. Results: We found no
      significant differences between the PVC groups for pain during mobilization at
      24-h postoperatively: PVC-Low: 6 (4–8) (median, (IQR)) versus PVC-High: 7 (5–8)
      (median, (IQR)), p = 0.10; and for pain at rest: PVC-Low 2 (0–3) (median, (IQR)) 
      versus PVC-High 3 (2–5) (median, (IQR)), p = 0.12. Other comparisons performed
      between predictive groups did not differ significantly. Conclusions: In this
      prospective cohort study of 102 THA patients, we did not find that preoperative
      pain by PVC, when using a cut-off point of NRS ≤ 2, were able to predict
      postoperative pain at 24 h postoperatively. Neither did PACU nurses’ prediction
      of pain, patients forecast of pain, nor did maximum pain levels at the PACU.
      Trial registration: Retrospectively registered 20th February 2018 at
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03439566).

      congenital heart disease in the offspring in the northeastern Sichuan, China.
LID - 3905
AB  - Nonhereditary factors play an important role in the occurrence of congenital
      heart disease (CHD). This study was to explore the possible parental
      nonhereditary exposure factors relevant to the occurrence of CHD in the
      northeastern Sichuan area. A total of 367 children with CHD and 367 children
      without congenital malformations aged 0 to 14 years old were recruited from the
      Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College and Nanchong Central
      Hospital between March 2016 and November 2018. This study was designed as a
      case-control study with 1:1 frequency matching, in which the parents of cases and
      controls were interviewed with the same questionnaire according to the
      gestational age of the child, maternal age during pregnancy and the same maternal
      race/ethnicity. Then, 322 matched case-control pairs were analysed by SPSS 22.
      Thirty-one suspicious factors were entered into the binary logistic regression
      analysis after univariate regression analysis of 55 factors (alpha = 0.05). The
      analysis results showed that 7 factors were significantly associated with the
      occurrence of CHD. Thus, augmenting maternal mental healthcare, improving the
      quality of drinking water, obtaining adequate nutrition, maintaining a healthy
      physical condition during pregnancy, enhancing parents’ level of knowledge and
      maintaining a healthy lifestyle may lower the occurrence of CHD.

      unclear. We assessed the contribution of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and
      opioidergic systems to this balance across reward and loss domains. Thirty-nine
      participants (17 healthy controls, 15 patients with pathological gambling, and 7 
      with binge eating disorder) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) imaging 
      with [18F]FDOPA, [11C]MADAM and [11C]carfentanil to assess presynaptic dopamine, 
      and serotonin transporter and mu-opioid receptor binding potential. Separately,
      participants completed a modified two-step task, which quantifies the degree to
      which decision-making is influenced by goal-directed or habitual strategies. All 
      participants completed a version with reward outcomes; healthy controls
      additionally completed a version with loss outcomes. In the context of rewarding 
      outcomes, we found that greater serotonin transporter binding potential in
      prefrontal regions was associated with habitual control, while greater serotonin 
      transporter binding potential in the putamen was marginally associated with
      goal-directed control; however, the findings were no longer significant when
      controlling for the opposing valence (loss). In blocks with loss outcomes, we
      found that the opioidergic system, specifically greater [11C]carfentanil binding 
      potential, was positively associated with goal-directed control and negatively
      associated with habit-directed control. Our findings illuminate the complex
      neurochemical basis of goal-directed and habitual behavior, implicating
      differential roles for prefrontal and subcortical serotonin in decision-making
      across healthy and pathological populations.

TI  - Evaluating kratom alkaloids using PHASE.
LID - e0229646
AB  - Kratom is a botanical substance that is marketed and promoted in the US for
      pharmaceutical opioid indications despite having no US Food and Drug
      Administration approved uses. Kratom contains over forty alkaloids including two 
      partial agonists at the mu opioid receptor, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine,
      that have been subjected to the FDA’s scientific and medical evaluation. However,
      pharmacological and toxicological data for the remaining alkaloids are limited.
      Therefore, we applied the Public Health Assessment via Structural Evaluation
      (PHASE) protocol to generate in silico binding profiles for 25 kratom alkaloids
      to facilitate the risk evaluation of kratom. PHASE demonstrates that kratom
      alkaloids share structural features with controlled opioids, indicates that
      several alkaloids bind to the opioid, adrenergic, and serotonin receptors, and
      suggests that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are the strongest binders at
      the mu opioid receptor. Subsequently, the in silico binding profiles of a subset 
      of the alkaloids were experimentally verified at the opioid, adrenergic, and
      serotonin receptors using radioligand binding assays. The verified binding
      profiles demonstrate the ability of PHASE to identify potential safety signals
      and provide a tool for prioritizing experimental evaluation of high-risk
      compounds.

      USA: Variations in buprenorphine and methadone treatment by geography,
      operational, and payment characteristics, 2007-16.
LID - e0229787
AB  - Objective: To identify the geographic, organisational, and payment correlates of 
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment among substance abuse treatment (SAT)
      providers. Methods: Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Substance Abuse 
      Treatment Services (NSSATS) from 2007–16 were conducted. We provide bivariate
      descriptive statistics regarding substance abuse treatment services which offered
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment from 2007–16. Using multiple logistic
      regression, we regressed geographic, organisational, and payment correlates on
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment. Results: Buprenorphine is increasingly
      offered at SAT facilities though uptake remains comparatively low outside of the 
      northeast. SAT facilities run by tribal governments or Indian Health Service
      which offer buprenorphine remain low compared to privately operated SAT
      facilities (AOR = 0.528). The odds of offering buprenorphine among facilities
      offering free or no charge treatment (AOR = 0.838) or a sliding fee scale (AOR = 
      0.464) was lower. SAT facilities accepting Medicaid payments showed higher odds
      of offering methadone treatment (AOR = 2.035). Conclusions: Greater attention
      towards the disparities in provision of opioid agonist therapies is warranted,
      especially towards the reasons why uptake has been moderate among civilian
      providers. Additionally, the care needs of Native Americans facing opioid-related
      use disorders bears further scrutiny.

TI  - Structure-based discovery of potent and selective melatonin receptor agonists.
LID - e53779
AB  - Melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 are involved in synchronizing circadian rhythms
      and are important targets for treating sleep and mood disorders, type-2 diabetes 
      and cancer. Here, we performed large scale structure-based virtual screening for 
      new ligand chemotypes using recently solved high-resolution 3D crystal structures
      of agonist-bound MT receptors. Experimental testing of 62 screening candidates
      yielded the discovery of 10 new agonist chemotypes with sub-micromolar potency at
      MT receptors, with compound 21 reaching EC50 of 0.36 nM. Six of these molecules
      displayed selectivity for MT2 over MT1. Moreover, two most potent agonists,
      including 21 and a close derivative of melatonin, 28, had dramatically reduced
      arrestin recruitment at MT2, while compound 37 was devoid of Gi signaling at MT1,
      implying biased signaling. This study validates the suitability of the
      agonist-bound orthosteric pocket in the MT receptor structures for the
      structure-based discovery of selective agonists.

TI  - Combining Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Transcutaneous Electrical
      Nerve Stimulation to Relieve Persistent Pain in a Patient Suffering from Complex 
      Regional Pain Syndrome: A Case Report.
PG  - 467-73
AB  - Purpose: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare neuropathic pain
      condition characterized by sensory, motor and autonomic alterations. Previous
      investigations have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can alleviate pain in various 
      populations, and that a combination of these treatments could provide greater
      hypoalgesic effects. In the present case report, we describe the effect of tDCS
      and TENS treatment on pain intensity and unpleasantness in a patient suffering
      from chronic CRPS. Results: The patient was a 37-year-old woman, suffering from
      left lower limb CRPS (type I) for more than 5 years. Despite medication
      (pregabalin, tapentadol, duloxetine), rehabilitation treatments (sensorimotor
      retraining, graded motor imagery) and spinal cord stimulation (SCS), the
      participant reported moderate to severe pain. Treatments of tDCS alone (performed
      with SCS turned off during tDCS application, 1 session/day, for 5 consecutive
      days) did not significantly decrease pain. Combining tDCS with TENS (SCS
      temporarily turned off during tDCS, 1 session/day, for 5 consecutive days)
      slightly reduced pain intensity and unpleasantness. Discussion: Our results
      suggest that combining tDCS and TENS could be a therapeutic strategy worth
      investigating further to relieve pain in chronic CRPS patients. Future studies
      should examine the efficacy of combined tDCS and TENS treatments in CRPS
      patients, and other chronic pain conditions, with special attention to the
      cumulative and long-term effects and its effect on function and quality of life.

TI  - Quadratus lumborum block versus transversus abdominis plane block for
      postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 53
AB  - Background: Abdominal surgery is common and is associated with severe
      postoperative pain. The transverse abdominal plane (TAP) block is considered an
      effective means for pain control in such cases. The quadratus lumborum (QL) block
      is another option for the management of postoperative pain. The aim of this study
      was to conduct a meta-analysis and thereby evaluate the efficacy and safety of QL
      blocks and TAP blocks for pain management after abdominal surgery. Methods: We
      comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, the Cochrane Library, Web of
      Science and CNKI for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared QL blocks 
      and TAP blocks for pain management in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. All 
      of the data were screened and evaluated by two researchers. RevMan5.3 was adopted
      for the meta-analysis. Results: A total of 8 RCTs involving 564 patients were
      included. The meta-analysis showed statistically significant differences between 
      the two groups with respect to postoperative pain scores at 2 h (standardized
      mean difference [Std.MD] = − 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] = − 2.63 to
      − 0.89; p < .001), 4 h (Std.MD = -0.77; 95% CI = -1.36 to − 0.18; p = .01),6 h
      (Std.MD = -1.24; 95% CI = -2.31 to − 0.17; p = .02),12 h (Std.MD = -0.70; 95%
      CI = -1.27 to − 0.13; p = .02) and 24 h (Std.MD = -0.65; 95% CI = -1.29 to
      − 0.02; p = .04); postoperative morphine consumption at 24 h (Std.MD = -1.39; 95%
      CI = -1.83 to − 0.95; p < .001); and duration of postoperative analgesia
      (Std.MD = 2.30; 95% CI = 1.85 to 2.75; p < .001). There was no statistically
      significant difference between the two groups with regard to the incidence of
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (RR = 0.55;95% CI = 0.27 to
      1.14;p = 0.11). Conclusion: The QL block provides better pain management with
      less opioid consumption than the TAP block after abdominal surgery. In addition, 
      there are no differences between the TAP block and QL block with respect to PONV.

TI  - Association of Formulary Exclusions and Restrictions for Opioid Alternatives With
      Opioid Prescribing Among Medicare Beneficiaries.
LID - e200274
AB  - Question: Are Medicare Part D formulary exclusions and restrictions for opioid
      alternatives associated with increases in opioid prescribing? Findings: Using
      county-level panel data throughout the United States, it was found that for each 
      additional opioid alternative not covered in a county, the rate of opioid
      prescribing increased by 2.2% to 3.7% relative to the mean opioid prescribing
      rate. Formulary restrictions in the form of utilization management strategies and
      high-cost tier placements for opioid alternatives were not associated with
      increases in opioid prescribing. Meaning: The findings of this study suggest that
      lack of coverage of opioid alternatives may encourage higher rates of opioid
      prescribing.

TI  - Modulation of feeding behavior and metabolism by dynorphin.
LID - 3821
AB  - The neuronal regulation of metabolic and behavioral responses to different diets 
      and feeding regimens is an important research area. Herein, we investigated if
      the opioid peptide dynorphin modulates feeding behavior and metabolism. Mice
      lacking dynorphin peptides (KO) were exposed to either a normal diet (ND) or a
      high-fat diet (HFD) for a period of 12 weeks. Additionally, mice had either
      time-restricted (TR) or ad libitum (AL) access to food. Body weight, food intake 
      and blood glucose levels were monitored throughout the 12-week feeding schedule. 
      Brain samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to detect changes in the
      expression levels of hypothalamic peptides. As expected, animals on HFD or having
      AL access to food gained more weight than mice on ND or having TR access.
      Unexpectedly, KO females on TR HFD as well as KO males on AL ND or AL HFD
      demonstrated a significantly increased body weight gain compared to the
      respective WT groups. The calorie intake differed only marginally between the
      genotypes: a significant difference was present in the female ND AL group, where 
      dynorphin KO mice ate more than WT mice. Although female KO mice on a TR feeding 
      regimen consumed a similar amount of food as WT controls, they displayed
      significantly higher levels of blood glucose. We observed significantly reduced
      levels of hypothalamic orexigenic peptides neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexin-A in
      KO mice. This decrease became particularly pronounced in the HFD groups and under
      AL condition. The kappa opiod receptor (KOR) levels were higher after HFD
      compared to ND feeding in the ventral pallidum of WT mice. We hypothesize that
      HFD enhances dynorphin signaling in this hedonic center to maintain energy
      homeostasis, therefore KO mice have a more pronounced phenotype in the HFD
      condition due to the lack of it. Our data suggest that dynorphin modulates
      metabolic changes associated with TR feeding regimen and HFD consumption. We
      conclude that the lack of dynorphin causes uncoupling between energy intake and
      body weight gain in mice; KO mice maintained on HFD become overweight despite
      their normal food intake. Thus, using kappa opioid receptor agonists against
      obesity could be considered as a potential treatment strategy.

TI  - Hoffmann’s syndrome necessitating forearm fasciotomy: a case report.
LID - 38
AB  - Background: Hoffmann’s syndrome is a rare form of hypothyroid myopathy. Only a
      few cases of fasciotomy in this setting have previously been reported. Case
      presentation: A 41-year-old Caucasian man under treatment for hypothyroidism
      presented with acute-onset severe pain in his forearm for no obvious reason and
      was admitted to our emergency room. He eventually developed compartment syndrome 
      which necessitated surgical decompression. Soon after surgery he complained of
      similar symptoms in his calves. By the time his hypothyroid status was confirmed,
      conservative treatment and orally administered levothyroxine gradually made the
      pain from his calves disappear, without further surgical treatment. Conclusion:
      Hoffmann’s syndrome may precipitate a compartment syndrome in the absence of
      trauma.

TI  - Elevated Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio in Older Adults with Cocaine Use Disorder
      as a Marker of Chronic Inflammation.
PG  - 32-40
AB  - Objective: The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a non-specific,
      easy-to-obtain marker of inflammation associated with morbidity and mortality in 
      systemic, psychiatric, and age-related inflammatory conditions. Given the growing
      trend of substance use disorder (SUD) in older adults, and the relationship
      between inflammation and SUD elevated NLR may serve as a useful inflammatory
      biomarker of the combined burden of aging and SUD. The present study focused on
      cocaine use disorder (CUD) to examine if cocaine adds further inflammatory burden
      among older adults, by comparing NLR values between older adults with CUD and a
      non-cocaine using, aged-matched, nationally representative sample. Methods: The
      dataset included 107 (86% male) participants (aged 50–65 years) with cocaine use 
      disorder. NLR was derived from complete blood count tests by dividing the
      absolute value of peripheral neutrophil concentration by lymphocyte
      concentration. For comparison, we extracted data from age-matched adults without 
      CUD using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Individuals with 
      immunocompromising conditions were excluded (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and
      sexually transmitted infections such as HIV). A doubly-robust inverse
      probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) propensity score method was
      used to estimate group differences on NLR while controlling for potential
      confounding variables (age, gender, race, income, nicotine, marijuana and alcohol
      use). Results: The IPWRA model revealed that the CUD sample had significantly
      elevated NLR in comparison to non-cocaine users, with a moderate effect size (β
      weight = 0.67). Conclusion: Although non-specific, NLR represents a readily
      obtainable inflammatory marker for SUD research. CUD may add further inflammatory
      burden to aging cocaine users.

LID - 6019435
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility to undertake an
      ileocolic resection in complex Crohn's disease using a minimal open abdominal
      access using standard laparoscopic instruments. The incision was carried out over
      the previous McBurney scar, with a mean length of 6 cm. Seventy-two patients with
      complicated Crohn's disease underwent IC resection in the considered period; 12
      patients had a McBurney scar due to a previous appendectomy and represented the
      group of study. Feasibility and safety of the procedure were evaluated. Clinical 
      data and outcome were compared with a control arm of 15 patients who had a
      standard laparoscopic IC resection, pooled out from our database among those who 
      had a McBurney incision as service incision. Mean operative time and
      postoperative stay were significantly shorter in the study group. Blood loss and 
      operative costs were also lower in the study group but did not reach statistical 
      significance. Minimal open access ileocolic resection (MOAIR) through a small
      McBurney incision seems safe and feasible in complex Crohn's disease. Some
      advantages over standard laparoscopic surgery could be found in surgical outcomes
      and costs.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine Improves Cardiovascular and Ventilatory Outcomes in Critically
      Ill Patients: Basic and Clinical Approaches.
LID - 1641
AB  - Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective α2-adrenergic agonist with sedative
      and analgesic properties, with minimal respiratory effects. It is used as a
      sedative in the intensive care unit and the operating room. The opioid-sparing
      effect and the absence of respiratory effects make dexmedetomidine an attractive 
      adjuvant drug for anesthesia in obese patients who are at an increased risk for
      postoperative respiratory complications. The pharmacodynamic effects on the
      cardiovascular system are known; however the mechanisms that induce
      cardioprotection are still under study. Regarding the pharmacokinetics
      properties, this drug is extensively metabolized in the liver by the uridine
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases. It has a relatively high hepatic extraction
      ratio, and therefore, its metabolism is dependent on liver blood flow. This
      review shows, from a basic clinical approach, the evidence supporting the use of 
      dexmedetomidine in different settings, from its use in animal models of
      ischemia-reperfusion, and cardioprotective signaling pathways. In addition,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies in obese subjects and the
      management of patients subjected to mechanical ventilation are described.
      Moreover, the clinical efficacy of delirium incidence in patients with indication
      of non-invasive ventilation is shown. Finally, the available evidence from DEX is
      described by a group of Chilean pharmacologists and clinicians who have worked
      for more than 10 years on DEX.

TI  - Physical and Pharmacological Restraints in Hospital Care: Protocol for a
      Systematic Review.
LID - 921
AB  - Background: Physical and pharmacological restraints, defined as all measures
      limiting a person in his or her freedom, are extensively used to handle unsafe or
      problematic behavior in hospital care. There are increasing concerns as to the
      extent with which these restraints are being used in hospitals, and whether their
      benefits outweigh their potential harm. There is currently no comprehensive
      literature overview on the beneficial and/or adverse effects of the use of
      physical and pharmacological restraints in the hospital setting. Methods: A
      systematic review of the existing literature will be performed on the beneficial 
      and/or adverse effects of physical and pharmacological restraints in the hospital
      setting. Relevant databases will be systematically searched. A dedicated search
      strategy was composed. A visualization of similarities (VOS) analysis was used to
      further specify the search. Observational studies, and if available, randomized
      controlled trials reporting on beneficial and/or adverse effects of physical
      and/or pharmacological restraints in the general hospital setting will be
      included. Data from included articles will be extracted and analyzed. If the data
      is suitable for quantitative analysis, meta-analysis will be applied. Discussion:
      This review will provide data on the beneficial and/or adverse effects of the use
      of physical and pharmacological restraints in hospital care. With this review we 
      aim to guide health professionals by providing a critique of the available
      evidence regarding their choice to either apply or withhold from using
      restraints. A limitation of the current review will be that we will not
      specifically address ethical aspects of restraint use. Nevertheless, the outcomes
      of our systematic review can be used in the composition of a multidisciplinary
      guideline. Furthermore, our systematic review might determine knowledge gaps in
      the evidence, and recommendations on how to target these gaps with future
      research. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO registration number:
      CRD42019116186.

TI  - Comparison of safety and analgesic efficacy of diclofenac sodium with etodolac
      after surgical extraction of third molars: a randomized, double-blind,
      double-dummy, parallel-group study.
PG  - 19-27
AB  - Background: Surgical extraction of third molars is associated with postoperative 
      pain and swelling at the extraction site. Pain is commonly managed using
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Postoperative pain is usually
      moderate to severe in the first 12 h postoperatively and lasts for 3–5 days.
      However, with NSAIDs, these symptoms usually subside within 24 h. Diclofenac
      sodium and etodolac are NSAIDs, more selectively cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors,
      with good analgesic efficacies. Methods: We compared the safety and analgesic
      efficacy of diclofenac sodium with etodolac peroral after surgical extraction of 
      third molars in a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. The
      subjective pain improvement and pain relief after 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h using
      the visual analogue scale were measured as the study outcome. Results: Etodolac
      was equivalent to diclofenac sodium in pain alleviation at all postoperative time
      periods. No significant differences were found between diclofenac sodium and
      etodolac groups (P > 0.05). Both study medications were well tolerated and safe
      with mild adverse effects in only a few participants. Conclusion: Diclofenac
      sodium and etodolac are comparable in terms of analgesic efficacy and safety
      after surgical removal of third molars.

TI  - Transversus Abdominis Plane Block Reduced Early Postoperative Pain after
      Robot-assisted Prostatectomy: a Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 3761
AB  - Analgesic effect of transversus abdominis plane block (TAP block) in lower major 
      abdominal laparoscopic surgery with about 5 cm of maximum surgical scar has been 
      controversial. We hypothesized that TAP block has benefits, so the analgesic
      effect of TAP block after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) was
      evaluated. One hundred patients were enrolled in this prospective,
      double-blinded, randomized study. Standardized general anesthesia with wound
      infiltration on camera port and fentanyl dose limit of 3 µg/kg was provided.
      Ultrasound-guided, single-shot subcostal TAP block with either 0.375% ropivacaine
      (Ropivacaine group, 48 patients) or normal saline (Control group, 52 patients)
      was performed by anesthesiologist in charge (34 anesthesiologists) after surgical
      procedure. Pain score using numerical rating scale (NRS) and postoperative
      intravenous fentanyl were evaluated for the first 24 postoperative hours. Median 
      values (interquartile range) of NRS scores when the patients were transferred to 
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) were 5 (2–7) in Ropivacaine group and 6 (4–8) in
      Control group at rest (P = 0.03), 5 (2–8) in Ropivacaine group and 7 (5–8) in
      Control group during movement (P < 0.01). These significant differences
      disappeared at the time of discharging PACU. Fentanyl doses for the first 24
      postoperative hours were 210 µg (120–360) in Ropivacaine group and 200 µg
      (120–370) in Control group (P = 0.79). These results indicated that subcostal TAP
      block by anesthesiologists of varied level of training reduced postoperative pain
      immediate after RALP. TAP block had fundamental analgesic effect, but this
      benefit was too small to reduce postoperative 24-hour fentanyl consumption.

TI  - An adaptable implementation package targeting evidence-based indicators in
      primary care: A pragmatic cluster-randomised evaluation.
LID - e1003045
AB  - Background: In primary care, multiple priorities and system pressures make
      closing the gap between evidence and practice challenging. Most implementation
      studies focus on single conditions, limiting generalisability. We compared an
      adaptable implementation package against an implementation control and assessed
      effects on adherence to four different evidence-based quality indicators. Methods
      and findings: We undertook two parallel, pragmatic cluster-randomised trials
      using balanced incomplete block designs in general practices in West Yorkshire,
      England. We used ‘opt-out’ recruitment, and we randomly assigned practices that
      did not opt out to an implementation package targeting either diabetes control or
      risky prescribing (Trial 1); or blood pressure (BP) control or anticoagulation in
      atrial fibrillation (AF) (Trial 2). Within trials, each arm acted as the
      implementation control comparison for the other targeted indicator. For example, 
      practices assigned to the diabetes control package acted as the comparison for
      practices assigned to the risky prescribing package. The implementation package
      embedded behaviour change techniques within audit and feedback, educational
      outreach, and computerised support, with content tailored to each indicator.
      Respective patient-level primary endpoints at 11 months comprised the following: 
      achievement of all recommended levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BP, and
      cholesterol; risky prescribing levels; achievement of recommended BP; and
      anticoagulation prescribing. Between February and March 2015, we recruited 144
      general practices collectively serving over 1 million patients. We stratified
      computer-generated randomisation by area, list size, and pre-intervention outcome
      achievement. In April 2015, we randomised 80 practices to Trial 1 (40 per arm)
      and 64 to Trial 2 (32 per arm). Practices and trial personnel were not blind to
      allocation. Two practices were lost to follow-up but provided some outcome data. 
      We analysed the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, adjusted for potential
      confounders at patient level (sex, age) and practice level (list size, locality, 
      pre-intervention achievement against primary outcomes, total quality scores, and 
      levels of patient co-morbidity), and analysed cost-effectiveness. The
      implementation package reduced risky prescribing (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 97.5%
      confidence interval [CI] 0.67–0.99, p = 0.017) with an incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio of £1,359 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but
      there was insufficient evidence of effect on other primary endpoints (diabetes
      control OR 1.03, 97.5% CI 0.89–1.18, p = 0.693; BP control OR 1.05, 97.5% CI
      0.96–1.16, p = 0.215; anticoagulation prescribing OR 0.90, 97.5% CI 0.75–1.09, p 
      = 0.214). No statistically significant effects were observed in any secondary
      outcome except for reduced co-prescription of aspirin and clopidogrel without
      gastro-protection in patients aged 65 and over (adjusted OR 0.62; 97.5% CI
      0.39–0.99; p = 0.021). Main study limitations concern our inability to make any
      inferences about the relative effects of individual intervention components,
      given the multifaceted nature of the implementation package, and that the
      composite endpoint for diabetes control may have been too challenging to achieve.
      Conclusions: In this study, we observed that a multifaceted implementation
      package was clinically and cost-effective for targeting prescribing behaviours
      within the control of clinicians but not for more complex behaviours that also
      required patient engagement. Trial registration: The study is registered with the
      ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN91989345).

TI  - The analgesic efficacy compared ultrasound-guided continuous transverse abdominis
      plane block with epidural analgesia following abdominal surgery: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 52
AB  - Background: This review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the analgesic efficacy
      of continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block compared with epidural
      analgesia (EA) in adults after abdominal surgery. Methods: The databases PubMed, 
      Embase and Cochrane Central Register were searched from inception to June 2019
      for all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the
      analgesic efficacy of continuous TAP block compared with EA after abdominal
      surgery. The weighted mean differences (WMDs) were estimates for continuous
      variables with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous
      data. The pre-specified primary outcome was the dynamic pain scores 24 h
      postoperatively. Results: Eight trials including 453 patients (TAP block:224
      patients; EA: 229 patients) ultimately met the inclusion criteria and seven
      trials were included in the meta-analysis. Dynamic pain scores after 24 h were
      equivalent between TAP block and EA groups (WMD:0.44; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.99;
      I2 = 91%; p = 0.11). The analysis showed a significant difference between the
      subgroups according to regularly administering (4 trials; WMD:-0.11; 95% CI:
      − 0.32 to 0.09; I2 = 0%; p = 0.28) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      or not (3 trials; WMD:1.02; 95% CI: 0.09 to 1.96; I2 = 94%; p = 0.03) for
      adjuvant analgesics postoperatively. The measured time of the urinary catheter
      removal in the TAP group was significantly shorter (3 trials, WMD:-18.95, 95%
      CI:-25.22 to − 12.71; I2 = 0%; p < 0.01), as was time to first ambulation
      postoperatively (4 trials, WMD:-6.61, 95% CI: − 13.03 to − 0.19; I2 = 67%;
      p < 0.05). Conclusion: Continuous TAP block, combined with NSAIDs, can provide
      non-inferior dynamic analgesia efficacy compared with EA in postoperative pain
      management after abdominal surgery. In addition, continuous TAP block is
      associated with fewer postoperative side effects.

TI  - Optimizing Antihypertensive Medication Classification in Electronic Health
      Record-Based Data: Classification System Development and Methodological
      Comparison.
LID - e14777
AB  - Background: Computable phenotypes have the ability to utilize data within the
      electronic health record (EHR) to identify patients with certain characteristics.
      Many computable phenotypes rely on multiple types of data within the EHR
      including prescription drug information. Hypertension (HTN)-related computable
      phenotypes are particularly dependent on the correct classification of
      antihypertensive prescription drug information, as well as corresponding
      diagnoses and blood pressure information. Objective: This study aimed to create
      an antihypertensive drug classification system to be utilized with EHR-based data
      as part of HTN-related computable phenotypes. Methods: We compared 4 different
      antihypertensive drug classification systems based off of 4 different
      methodologies and terminologies, including 3 RxNorm Concept Unique Identifier
      (RxCUI)–based classifications and 1 medication name–based classification. The
      RxCUI-based classifications utilized data from (1) the Drug Ontology, (2) the new
      Medication Reference Terminology, and (3) the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
      Classification System and DrugBank, whereas the medication name–based
      classification relied on antihypertensive drug names. Each classification system 
      was applied to EHR-based prescription drug data from hypertensive patients in the
      OneFlorida Data Trust. Results: There were 13,627 unique RxCUIs and 8025 unique
      medication names from the 13,879,046 prescriptions. We observed a broad overlap
      between the 4 methods, with 84.1% (691/822) to 95.3% (695/729) of terms
      overlapping pairwise between the different classification methods. Key
      differences arose from drug products with multiple dosage forms, drug products
      with an indication of benign prostatic hyperplasia, drug products that contain
      more than 1 ingredient (combination products), and terms within the
      classification systems corresponding to retired or obsolete RxCUIs. Conclusions: 
      In total, 2 antihypertensive drug classifications were constructed, one based on 
      RxCUIs and one based on medication name, that can be used in future computable
      phenotypes that require antihypertensive drug classifications.

TI  - Myhre Syndrome Associated With Dunbar Syndrome and Urinary Tract Abnormalities: A
      Case Report.
LID - 72
AB  - Myhre syndrome is a rare condition caused by a mutation in the SMAD4 gene, which 
      leads to a defective TGF-β/BMP signaling, resulting in the proliferation of
      abnormal fibrous tissues. Clinically, patients with Myhre syndrome manifest with 
      defects of connective tissue (skin, muscles, joints), and cardiovascular and
      neurological impairment. In our report, we present a case of a 16-year-old female
      with skeletal abnormalities, reduced articular mobility, skin, and muscular
      hypertrophy and cardiovascular defects characteristic of Myhre syndrome.
      Long-term pulmonary hypertension and arterial hypertension were persistent in
      spite of antihypertensive treatment. Our patient was also diagnosed with chronic 
      kidney disease and Dunbar syndrome, which is an external compression of the
      coeliac trunk or coeliac artery by the surrounding tissues. Until now, only a few
      cases of renal complications in Myhre syndrome have been published. We describe
      for the first time a female patient with genetically confirmed Myhre syndrome
      caused by the p.Ile500Val SMAD4 mutation presenting with an unusual occurrence of
      congenital vesicoureteral reflux, proteinuria with a decreased renal function,
      and a condition recognized as Dunbar syndrome.

TI  - Motivations for crystal methamphetamine-opioid co-injection/co-use amongst
      community-recruited people who inject drugs: a qualitative study.
LID - 14
AB  - Aims: We report on motivations for crystal methamphetamine-opioid
      co-use/co-injection through narratives of people who inject drugs during a period
      of increased crystal methamphetamine use reporting in Australia. Methods:
      Fourteen in-depth interviews were undertaken with selected participants (12 male,
      2 female) from the Melbourne Injecting Drug User Cohort Study, including those in
      and out of opioid substitution therapy (OST). Results: The main motivations for
      co-use reported by participants were as follows: (1) that heroin could be used to
      reduce the negative side effects of heavy crystal methamphetamine use,
      particularly during the ‘comedown’ phase; (2) that small quantities of crystal
      methamphetamine used with heroin could prolong the intoxication effect of heroin,
      and hence the time before opioid withdrawal; (3) that co-injection of crystal
      methamphetamine and heroin produced a more desirable intoxication effect than
      using either substance on its own and; (4) that crystal methamphetamine provided 
      a substitute ‘high’ for heroin after commencing OST treatment. Conclusions:
      Co-use of methamphetamine and opioids has been used by people who inject drugs to
      facilitate intoxication, sometimes as the result of ineffective opioid
      substitution therapy (OST) treatment and perceived lack of pleasure after
      stabilisation on OST treatment.

TI  - Genetics of ADHD: What Should the Clinician Know?
LID - 18
AB  - Purpose of Review: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) shows high
      heritability in formal genetic studies. In our review article, we provide an
      overview on common and rare genetic risk variants for ADHD and their link to
      clinical practice. Recent findings: The formal heritability of ADHD is about 80% 
      and therefore higher than most other psychiatric diseases. However, recent
      studies estimate the proportion of heritability based on singlenucleotide
      variants (SNPs) at 22%. It is a matter of debate which genetic mechanisms explain
      this huge difference. While frequent variants in first mega-analyses of
      genome-wideassociation study data containing several thousand patients give the
      first genome-wide results, explaining only little variance, the methodologically 
      more difficult analyses of rare variants are still in their infancy. Some rare
      genetic syndromes show higher prevalence for ADHD indicating a potential role for
      a small number of patients. In contrast, polygenic risk scores (PRS) could
      potentially be applied to every patient. We give an overview how PRS explain
      different behavioral phenotypes in ADHD and how they could be used for diagnosis 
      and therapy prediction. Summary: Knowledge about a patient’s genetic makeup is
      not yet mandatory for ADHD therapy or diagnosis. PRS however have been introduced
      successfully in other areas of clinical medicine, and their application in
      psychiatry will begin within the next years. In order to ensure competent advice 
      for patients, knowledge of the current state of research is useful
      forpsychiatrists.

TI  - Promoting Reproducible Research for Characterizing Nonmedical Use of Medications 
      Through Data Annotation: Description of a Twitter Corpus and Guidelines.
LID - e15861
AB  - Background: Social media data are being increasingly used for population-level
      health research because it provides near real-time access to large volumes of
      consumer-generated data. Recently, a number of studies have explored the
      possibility of using social media data, such as from Twitter, for monitoring
      prescription medication abuse. However, there is a paucity of annotated data or
      guidelines for data characterization that discuss how information related to
      abuse-prone medications is presented on Twitter. Objective: This study discusses 
      the creation of an annotated corpus suitable for training supervised
      classification algorithms for the automatic classification of medication
      abuse–related chatter. The annotation strategies used for improving
      interannotator agreement (IAA), a detailed annotation guideline, and machine
      learning experiments that illustrate the utility of the annotated corpus are also
      described. Methods: We employed an iterative annotation strategy, with
      interannotator discussions held and updates made to the annotation guidelines at 
      each iteration to improve IAA for the manual annotation task. Using the grounded 
      theory approach, we first characterized tweets into fine-grained categories and
      then grouped them into 4 broad classes—abuse or misuse, personal consumption,
      mention, and unrelated. After the completion of manual annotations, we
      experimented with several machine learning algorithms to illustrate the utility
      of the corpus and generate baseline performance metrics for automatic
      classification on these data. Results: Our final annotated set consisted of
      16,443 tweets mentioning at least 20 abuse-prone medications including opioids,
      benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, central nervous system stimulants, and 
      gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs. Our final overall IAA was 0.86 (Cohen kappa),
      which represents high agreement. The manual annotation process revealed the
      variety of ways in which prescription medication misuse or abuse is discussed on 
      Twitter, including expressions indicating coingestion, nonmedical use,
      nonstandard route of intake, and consumption above the prescribed doses. Among
      machine learning classifiers, support vector machines obtained the highest
      automatic classification accuracy of 73.00% (95% CI 71.4-74.5) over the test set 
      (n=3271). Conclusions: Our manual analysis and annotations of a large number of
      tweets have revealed types of information posted on Twitter about a set of
      abuse-prone prescription medications and their distributions. In the interests of
      reproducible and community-driven research, we have made our detailed annotation 
      guidelines and the training data for the classification experiments publicly
      available, and the test data will be used in future shared tasks.

TI  - On the Nature of the Mother-Infant Tie and Its Interaction With Freudian Drives.
LID - 317
AB  - The affective bond between an infant and its caregiver, the so-called
      mother-infant tie, was analyzed by various reputable psychologists (e.g.,
      Ainsworth, Clark, Erikson, Anna Freud, Harlow, Klein, Spitz, and Winnicott) but
      both the basic tenets of the bond and the importance of the trauma of maternal
      deprivation for personality disorders in adults were introduced by Bowlby.
      Although Bowlby was a trained psychoanalyst, he rejected central cornerstones of 
      Freudian theory (esp. drive theory) and used concepts promulgated by renowned
      ethologists (Tinbergen and Lorenz) to establish his framework of “instinctive
      behavior” that has been developed further into the concept of “attachment theory”
      under the influence of Mary Ainsworth. However, since any precise experimental
      facts were lacking when Bowlby formulated his ideas on the concept of instinctive
      behavior, the whole framework is a descriptive, category-driven approach (like
      the ones of Freudian drives). In order to connect the mother-infant tie – as
      propounded by Bowlby – with experimental data, this manuscript undertakes a
      biochemical analysis of it because this strategy proved somewhat successful in
      relation to Freudian drives. The analysis unfolded that the neurochemical
      oxytocin, released by the action of sensory nerves, is of utmost importance for
      the operation of the mother-infant tie. Furthermore, multiple evidences have been
      presented to the fact that there is strong interaction between unconsciously
      operating Freudian drives and the consciously acting mother-infant tie (that is
      now classified as a drive). The outlined interaction in conjunction with the
      classification of attachment urges as drives gave a very detailed insight into
      how a SEEKING-derived reward can be evoked during operation of the mother-infant 
      tie. In summary, there is no need to marginalize either the mother-infant tie or 
      Freudian drives but rather there is need to respect both (principally different) 
      impulses in moving toward a more extensive description.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine Pharmacokinetics in Neonates with Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy
      Receiving Hypothermia.
LID - 2582965
AB  - Dexmedetomidine is a promising sedative and analgesic for newborns with
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH).
      Pharmacokinetics and safety of dexmedetomidine were evaluated in a phase I,
      single-center, open-label study to inform future trial strategies. We recruited 7
      neonates ≥36 weeks' gestational age diagnosed with moderate-to-severe HIE, who
      received a continuous dexmedetomidine infusion during TH and the 6 h rewarming
      period. Time course of plasma dexmedetomidine concentration was characterized by 
      serial blood sampling during and after the 64.8 ± 6.9 hours of infusion.
      Noncompartmental analysis yielded descriptive pharmacokinetic estimates: plasma
      clearance of 0.760 ± 0.155 L/h/kg, steady-state distribution volume of
      5.22 ± 2.62 L/kg, and mean residence time of 6.84 ± 3.20 h. Naive pooled and
      population analyses according to a one-compartment model provided similar
      estimates of clearance and distribution volume. Overall, clearance was either
      comparable or lower, distribution volume was larger, and mean residence time or
      elimination half-life was longer in cooled newborns with HIE compared to
      corresponding estimates previously reported for uncooled (normothermic) newborns 
      without HIE at comparable gestational and postmenstrual ages. As a result, plasma
      concentrations in cooled newborns with HIE rose more slowly in the initial hours 
      of infusion compared to predicted concentration-time profiles based on reported
      pharmacokinetic parameters in normothermic newborns without HIE, while similar
      steady-state levels were achieved. No acute adverse events were associated with
      dexmedetomidine treatment. While dexmedetomidine appeared safe for neonates with 
      HIE during TH at infusion doses up to 0.4 μg/kg/h, a loading dose strategy may be
      needed to overcome the initial lag in rise of plasma dexmedetomidine
      concentration.

TI  - Identification and Management of Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity After
      Traumatic Brain Injury.
LID - 81
AB  - Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) has predominantly been described after
      traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is associated with hyperthermia,
      hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, dystonia (hypertonia or
      spasticity), and even motor features such as extensor/flexion posturing. Despite 
      the pathophysiology of PSH not being completely understood, most researchers
      gradually agree that PSH is driven by the loss of the inhibition of excitation in
      the sympathetic nervous system without parasympathetic involvement. Recently,
      advances in the clinical and diagnostic features of PSH in TBI patients have
      reached a broad clinical consensus in many neurology departments. These advances 
      should provide a more unanimous foundation for the systematic research on this
      clinical syndrome and its clear management. Clinically, a great deal of attention
      has been paid to the definition and diagnostic criteria, epidemiology and
      pathophysiology, symptomatic treatment, and prevention and control of secondary
      brain injury of PSH in TBI patients. Potential benefits of treatment for PSH may 
      result from the three main goals: eliminating predisposing causes, mitigating
      excessive sympathetic outflow, and supportive therapy. However, individual
      pathophysiological differences, therapeutic responses and outcomes, and precision
      medicine approaches to PSH management are varied and inconsistent between
      studies. Further, many potential therapeutic drugs might suppress manifestations 
      of PSH in the process of TBI treatment. The purpose of this review is to present 
      current and comprehensive studies of the identification of PSH after TBI in the
      early stage and provide a framework for symptomatic management of TBI patients
      with PSH.

TI  - Exploring the Use of Meditation as a Valuable Tool to Counteract Sedentariness.
LID - 299
AB  - Some forms of meditation have been recently proposed as effective tools to
      facilitate the handling of undesired thoughts and reappraisal of negative
      emotions that commonly arise during exercise-related situations. The effects of
      meditation-based interventions on psychological responses could also be used as a
      means by which to increase exercise adherence and counteract the detrimental
      consequences of sedentariness. In the present article, we briefly describe the
      effects of meditation on physical activity and related factors. We also propose a
      theoretical model as a means by which to further understanding of the effects of 
      meditation on psychological, psychophysical, and psychophysiological responses
      during exercise. The results of very recent studies in the realms of cognitive
      and affective psychology are promising. The putative psychological mechanisms
      underlying the effects of meditation on exercise appear to be associated with the
      interpretation of interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory signals. This is
      primarily due to the fact that meditation influences the cerebral processing of
      physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts. In such instances, the bodily and
      perceptual responses that are commonly reported during exercise might be assuaged
      during the practice of meditation. It also appears that conscious presence and
      self-compassion function as an emotional backdrop against which more complex
      behaviors can be forged. In such instances, re-engagement to physical activity
      programs can be more effectively achieved through the implementation of holistic 
      methods to treat the body and mind. The comments provided in the present paper
      might have very important implications for exercise adherence and the treatment
      of hypokinetic diseases.

TI  - Adaptation for Regulatory Application: A Content Analysis of FDA Risk Evaluation 
      and Mitigation Strategies Assessment Plans (2014–2018) Using RE-AIM.
LID - 43
AB  - Background: Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) are safety programs 
      that U.S. Food and Drug Administration can require to ensure a drug's benefits
      outweigh its risks and can be considered public health interventions. FDA's 2019 
      draft Guidance for Industry on REMS Assessments encourages the development of
      “novel methods for assessing REMS [to] help advance the science of post-market
      assessment of effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies.”Objective: To
      characterize REMS assessment plans using RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, 
      Implementation, Maintenance) framework and identify areas for advancing methods
      for evaluating REMS programs. RE-AIM was selected for its wide application
      evaluating the translation of scientific advances into practice for public health
      impact.Methods: A content analysis of REMS assessment plans (N = 18) and
      measures(n = 540) was conducted for REMS programs approved by FDA between
      1/1/2014–12/31/2018. Eligibility criteria were: a new drug application or
      biologic license application, included FDA-mandated mitigation strategies called 
      elements to assure safe use (ETASU), and represented a single product REMS
      program. Assessment plans were collected from publicly available regulatory
      approval letters from REMS@FDA website. Blinded reviewers categorized each REMS
      assessment measure to a RE-AIM dimension, adjudicated their application (average 
      IRR 75%), and refined the adapted dimensions' definitions. Dimensions were also
      mapped to REMS Assessment guidance categories.Results: The median number of
      assessment measures per REMS assessment plan was 31 (IQR: 21–36). Frequency of
      measures per RE-AIM criteria per REMS program was: Reach (median = 2; IQR: 2–4); 
      Effectiveness (median = 2.5; IQR:1–4); Adoption (median = 3.5; IQR: 2–5);
      Implementation (median = 18; IQR: 15–24); Maintenance (median = 0; IQR: 0–1).
      Adoption (among prescriber, health system agents of implementation) was more
      commonly assessed than Reach (population-attributable number of patients
      affected). Assessment of heterogeneity of Adoption and Reach was generally
      absent. Implementation assessment measures were most common among drugs requiring
      evidence of safe-use conditions before dispensing or administering the drug.
      Patient-level Effectiveness and Maintenance assessments were most common among
      drugs requiring patient monitoring.Discussion: Implementation science frameworks,
      such as RE-AIM, can be applied to characterize REMS assessment measures and
      identify opportunities for standardizing and strengthening their evaluation.
      Methods to measure Maintenance are needed to provide real-world evidence of REMS 
      integration into the healthcare system.

TI  - HIV-1 Tat: Role in Bystander Toxicity.
LID - 61
AB  - HIV Tat protein is a critical protein that plays multiple roles in HIV
      pathogenesis. While its role as the transactivator of HIV transcription is
      well-established, other non-viral replication-associated functions have been
      described in several HIV-comorbidities even in the current antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) era. HIV Tat protein is produced and released into the extracellular space 
      from cells with active HIV replication or from latently HIV-infected cells into
      neighboring uninfected cells even in the absence of active HIV replication and
      viral production due to effective ART. Neighboring uninfected and HIV-infected
      cells can take up the released Tat resulting in the upregulation of inflammatory 
      genes and activation of pathways that leads to cytotoxicity observed in several
      comorbidities such as HIV associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), HIV
      associated cardiovascular impairment, and accelerated aging. Thus, understanding 
      how Tat modulates host and viral response is important in designing novel
      therapeutic approaches to target the chronic inflammatory effects of soluble
      viral proteins in HIV infection.

TI  - Cationic Arginine-Rich Peptides (CARPs): A Novel Class of Neuroprotective Agents 
      With a Multimodal Mechanism of Action.
LID - 108
AB  - There are virtually no clinically available neuroprotective drugs for the
      treatment of acute and chronic neurological disorders, hence there is an urgent
      need for the development of new neuroprotective molecules. Cationic arginine-rich
      peptides (CARPs) are an expanding and relatively novel class of compounds, which 
      possess intrinsic neuroprotective properties. Intriguingly, CARPs possess a
      combination of biological properties unprecedented for a neuroprotective agent
      including the ability to traverse cell membranes and enter the CNS, antagonize
      calcium influx, target mitochondria, stabilize proteins, inhibit proteolytic
      enzymes, induce pro-survival signaling, scavenge toxic molecules, and reduce
      oxidative stress as well as, having a range of anti-inflammatory, analgesic,
      anti-microbial, and anti-cancer actions. CARPs have also been used as carrier
      molecules for the delivery of other putative neuroprotective agents across the
      blood-brain barrier and blood-spinal cord barrier. However, there is increasing
      evidence that the neuroprotective efficacy of many, if not all these other agents
      delivered using a cationic arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (CCPPs) carrier
      (e.g., TAT) may actually be mediated largely by the properties of the carrier
      molecule, with overall efficacy further enhanced according to the amino acid
      composition of the cargo peptide, in particular its arginine content. Therefore, 
      in reviewing the neuroprotective mechanisms of action of CARPs we also consider
      studies using CCPPs fused to a putative neuroprotective peptide. We review the
      history of CARPs in neuroprotection and discuss in detail the intrinsic
      biological properties that may contribute to their cytoprotective effects and
      their usefulness as a broad-acting class of neuroprotective drugs.

TI  - Music Use for Sedation in Critically ill Children (MUSiCC trial): study protocol 
      for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
LID - 31
AB  - Background: Stress induced by pain and anxiety is common in pediatric intensive
      care unit (PICU) patients. Sedation/analgesia in PICU is usually achieved through
      various analgesics and sedatives. Excessive use of these drugs can put patients
      at risk for hemodynamic/respiratory instability, prolonged ventilation,
      withdrawal, delirium, and critical illness polyneuromyopathy.The use of
      non-pharmacologic interventions has been recommended by sedation guidelines.
      However, non-pharmacological measures in PICU, including music and noise
      reduction, have been inadequately studied. Methods: The Music Use for Sedation in
      Critically ill Children (MUSiCC trial) pilot study is an investigator-initiated, 
      three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the use of music for sedation in 
      PICU. The main goal of the study is to demonstrate feasibility of a music trial
      in PICU and to obtain the necessary information to plan a larger trial. The study
      compares music versus noise cancelation versus control in sedated and
      mechanically ventilated children admitted to PICU. In the music group, children
      receive the music (modified classical music) three times a day for 30 min at a
      time. Music is delivered with noise cancelation headphones. The noise cancelation
      group receives the same intervention but with a no music (sham playlist). The
      control group receives usual care with no specific intervention. Children remain 
      in the study until extubation or a maximum of 7 days. The primary outcomes of the
      study are feasibility and sedation/analgesia requirements. Secondary outcomes
      include change in vital signs before and during the intervention, ICU delirium,
      and adverse effects related to the intervention. The estimated sample size is 20 
      subjects per group for a total of 60 children. Discussion: Despite being
      recommended by current guidelines, evidence to support the use of music in PICU
      is lacking. Music has the potential to reduce sedation requirements and their
      negative side effects. This pilot RCT will demonstrate feasibility and provide
      the necessary information to plan a larger trial focusing on the effectiveness of
      the intervention. Trial registration: The study was registered at
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03497559) on April 13, 2018.

TI  - Agonist-selective recruitment of engineered protein probes and of GRK2 by opioid 
      receptors in living cells.
LID - e54208
AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through allostery, and it is
      increasingly clear that chemically distinct agonists can produce different
      receptor-based effects. It has been proposed that agonists selectively promote
      receptors to recruit one cellular interacting partner over another, introducing
      allosteric ‘bias’ into the signaling system. However, the underlying hypothesis -
      that different agonists drive GPCRs to engage different cytoplasmic proteins in
      living cells - remains untested due to the complexity of readouts through which
      receptor-proximal interactions are typically inferred. We describe a cell-based
      assay to overcome this challenge, based on GPCR-interacting biosensors that are
      disconnected from endogenous transduction mechanisms. Focusing on opioid
      receptors, we directly demonstrate differences between biosensor recruitment
      produced by chemically distinct opioid ligands in living cells. We then show that
      selective recruitment applies to GRK2, a biologically relevant GPCR regulator,
      through discrete interactions of GRK2 with receptors or with G protein beta-gamma
      subunits which are differentially promoted by agonists.

TI  - Effects of synbiotic supplementation on energy and macronutrients homeostasis and
      muscle wasting of critical care patients: study protocol and a review of previous
      studies.
LID - 221
AB  - Background: An extreme and persistent dysbiosis occurs among critically ill
      patients, regardless of the heterogeneity of disease. Dysbiosis in critically ill
      patients may make them prone to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, multi-organ
      failure (MOF), energy homeostasis disturbance, muscle wasting, and cachexia.
      Modulation of gut microbiota through synbiotics can be considered as a potential 
      treatment for muscle wasting and macronutrient homeostasis disturbances. Methods:
      This is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, parallel randomized
      controlled trial with the aim to evaluate the effects of synbiotic
      supplementation on energy and macronutrient homeostasis and muscle wasting in
      critically ill patients. A total of 40 hemodynamically stable, adult, critically 
      ill patients who receive enteral nutrition via a nasogasteric tube (NGT) in the
      24–48 h after admission to critical care will be included in this study. Eligible
      patients will be randomly assigned to receive Lactocare (ZistTakhmir) capsules
      500 mg every 12 h or a placebo capsule, which contains only the sterile maize
      starch and is similar to synbiotic capsules for 14 days. The synbiotic and
      placebo capsules will be given through the nasogastric tube, separately from
      gavage, after feeding. Discussion: Gut microbiota modulation through synbiotics
      is proposed to improve clinical prognosis and reduce infectious complications,
      ventilator dependency, and length of ICU stay by improving energy and
      macronutrient homeostasis and reducing muscle protein catabolism. Trial

TI  - Trajectory of migraine-related disability following long-term treatment with
      lasmiditan: results of the GLADIATOR study.
LID - 20
AB  - Background: Migraine is recognized as the second leading cause of disability
      globally. Lasmiditan is a novel, selective serotonin 5-HT1F receptor agonist
      developed for acute treatment of migraine. Here we analyzed effects of lasmiditan
      on migraine disability assessed with the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS)
      scale for interim data from a long-term safety study. Methods: Completers of two 
      single-attack parent studies were offered participation in the 1 year GLADIATOR
      study, that randomized participants to treatment with lasmiditan 100 mg or 200 mg
      taken as needed for migraine attacks of at least moderate severity. Changes in
      MIDAS were modeled using a mixed model repeated measures analysis. Results: The
      sample included 1978 patients who received ≥1 lasmiditan dose and were followed
      for a median of 288 days. Baseline mean MIDAS scores for the lasmiditan 100-mg
      and 200-mg groups were 29.4 and 28.9, respectively, indicating severe
      migraine-related disability. Relative to baseline, MIDAS total scores were
      significantly lower at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months for both dose groups. At 12 months,
      changes in MIDAS scores were − 12.5 and − 12.2 for lasmiditan 100 mg and 200 mg, 
      respectively, with 49% and 53% of patients, respectively, achieving at least a
      50% decrease in MIDAS total score. Statistically significant improvements were
      also seen for work and/or school absenteeism and presenteeism, monthly headache
      days, and mean headache pain intensity at all time points up to 1 year. Findings 
      for patients who completed all visits versus those dropping out early were
      similar. Responses were generally similar for the lasmiditan 100 mg or 200 mg
      doses, between subgroups defined based on the number of baseline monthly migraine
      attacks (≤5 vs. >5), and also between subgroups defined by pain-free response
      (yes/no) during initial attacks. Conclusions: Long-term treatment with lasmiditan
      was associated with significant reductions in migraine-related disability,
      including both work or school absenteeism and presenteeism. The similarity of
      responses in completers and those who dropped out suggests that selective
      attrition does not account for the improvements. Benefits were significant at
      3 months and maintained through 12 months. Trial registration:

TI  - The efficacy of continuous versus single-injection femoral nerve block in Total
      knee Arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 121
AB  - Background: Continuous femoral nerve block (cFNB) has been developed to extend
      the analgesic effect since the efficacy of single-injection femoral nerve block
      (sFNB) is often limited to approximately 16–24 h. The aim of this meta-analysis
      was to validate the add-on effect of cFNB in the setting of a multimodal
      analgesic protocol. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature review on
      Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library and PubMed. Eight randomized
      controlled trials (N = 626) that compared the efficacy of cFNB with sFNB were
      included. The primary outcome domains consist of visual analog scale (VAS) score 
      at postoperative 24 and 48 h. The secondary outcome domains include opioid
      consumption, length of hospital stay and incidence of nausea. Results: Our
      analysis revealed that cFNB was associated with a lower VAS score at 24 h (SMD:
      -0.277;95% CI − 0.503 to − 0.05). However, the difference of VAS score did not
      meet the minimal clinically importance difference for total knee arthroplasty
      (TKA). VAS score at 48 h was similar between the cFNB and sFNB group. The cFNB
      group was associated with less amount of opioids consumed at both 24(SMD:
      -1.056;95% CI − 1.737 to − 0.375) and 48 h(SMD: -1.040;95% CI − 1.790 to
      − 0.289). Length of hospital stay and incidence of nausea were similar between
      the two groups. Conclusion: In the setting of a multimodal analgesic protocol,
      patients might benefit from cFNB with regards to a reduced need of opioids in the
      early postoperative period. However, we did not find a clinically significant
      difference in pain scores at different time points between the cFNB and sFNB
      group. Level of evidence: I; meta-analysis.

TI  - Consistency between anticholinergic burden scales in the elderly with fractures.
LID - e0228532
AB  - Objective: Falls and bone fractures are important causes of morbidity and
      mortality in the elderly. The objective of this study was to identify the degree 
      of consistency between the anticholinergic scales used for patients diagnosed
      with fractures. Methods: This was an analytical agreement study conducted in
      patients diagnosed with vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in Colombia. The
      quadratic-weighted kappa coefficient was used to identify the consistency between
      the Anticholinergic Drug Scale-ADS, Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale-ACB
      and Anticholinergic Risk Scale-ARS in assessing the prescriptions of fracture
      patients during the month prior to the fracture, during their stay as an
      inpatient and at discharge, according to Landis criteria. Results: 220 patients
      with fractures were included, with a mean age of 75.3±10.3 years, and 68.2% were 
      women. The ACB scale identified the highest anticholinergic burden (26.8%) in
      prescriptions made the month before the fracture, and the highest agreement was
      between ACB and ADS (0.717); during hospitalization and at discharge, the
      cholinergic antagonists were best identified with ADS (77.7% and 72.1%,
      respectively), with the best agreement between ACB and ARS (0.613 and 0.568,
      respectively). The prescription of tramadol was found in 64.1% of hospitalized
      patients and in 61.4% of patients at the time of discharge. Conclusions: The
      scales evaluated show marked discrepancies between them, with highly variable
      frequencies of anticholinergic drugs identified at the different prescription
      times, and with low agreement among them, which is why the scales are not
      interchangeable in patients with bone fractures.

TI  - Benzodiazepines in the oral fluid of Spanish drivers.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Driving under the influence of alcohol, illicit drugs and certain
      medicines is not allowed worldwide. Roadside drug testing is considered an
      important tool for determining such behavior. In Spain, mandatory roadside oral
      fluid drug testing is carried out regularly. The aim of this study was to
      determine the prevalence of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepines in combination
      with other drugs in drivers, examine benzodiazepine concentrations in drivers,
      and analyze the association of these factors with age and sex. Methods: This
      study assessed data on Spanish drivers with confirmed drug-positive results
      recorded by the Spanish National Traffic Agency (Dirección General de Tráfico)
      between 2011 and 2016, accounting for 179,645 tests and 65,244 confirmed
      drug-positive tests. Results: Benzodiazepines were confirmed in 4.3% of all
      positive roadside drug tests. In most of those cases (97.1%), other substances
      were also detected, particularly cocaine (75.3%) and cannabis (64.0%). The
      frequency of benzodiazepine-positive drivers (OR, 1.094; 95% CI, 1.088–1.100)
      increased with age, while the frequency of drivers who tested positive for
      benzodiazepines in conjunction with other substances, compared with drivers who
      tested positive for benzodiazepines alone, decreased with age (OR, 0.903; 95% CI,
      0.825–0.988). Nordiazepam (54.8%) and alprazolam (46.9%) were the most common
      benzodiazepines detected. Conclusion: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and
      other psychoactive substances was found to be a common behavior among drivers who
      tested positive on the road. It is important to raise awareness of all those
      involved in the consumption of driving-impairing substances (authorities,
      healthcare providers, patients and their families, etc.): roadside detection of
      driving-impairing substances is suggested, in addition to promoting the use of
      fewer driving-impairing medications and the provision of clear information to
      patients.

TI  - Pain relief and improvement in quality of life with 10 kHz SCS therapy: Summary
      of clinical evidence.
PG  - 403-15
AB  - Objective: Chronic pain is a prevalent condition which has a significant effect
      on the lives of those it impacts. High‐frequency 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation
      (10 kHz SCS) has been shown to provide paresthesia‐free pain relief for a wide
      variety of pain indications. This article summarizes the current and emerging
      data as they relate to the clinical use of the therapy in various pain syndromes.
      Methods: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed electronic database
      using keywords related to 10 kHz SCS. The database was queried from 2013 to May
      2019. Articles reporting clinical studies that included human subjects
      permanently treated with 10 kHz SCS (Senza® system) were included in the review. 
      Recent and relevant conference proceedings known to the authors were also
      included. Results: The selected literature demonstrated significant evidence for 
      the efficacy of 10 kHz SCS in treating chronic back and leg pain (CBLP),
      including a randomized, controlled trial as well as prospective and retrospective
      studies. One‐year follow‐up responder rates (pain relief ≥50%) ranged from 60% to
      80%. Other studies and case series showed promising outcomes in specific
      conditions, including nonsurgical refractory back pain, neuropathic limb pain,
      complex regional pain syndrome, chronic widespread pain, chronic pelvic pain, and
      intractable headache. Subgroup analyses also pointed toward the potential of
      10 kHz SCS being successful when low‐frequency SCS has failed. The vast majority 
      of these studies reported improved quality of life (QOL) metrics and/or reduced
      opioid consumption. Conclusions: Level I evidence already exists for the efficacy
      of 10 kHz SCS in treating CBLP, supported by real‐world clinical experience.
      Other studies demonstrate the potential of the therapy across a range of chronic 
      pain etiologies, although larger confirmatory studies are recommended. Overall,
      the literature suggests that the therapy is associated with improved QOL as well 
      as reduced opioid consumption.

TI  - Identification of MOR-Positive B Cell as Possible Innovative Biomarker (Mu
      Lympho-Marker) for Chronic Pain Diagnosis in Patients with Fibromyalgia and
      Osteoarthritis Diseases †.
LID - 1499
AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) diagnosis follows the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
      criteria, based on clinical evaluation and written questionnaires without any
      objective diagnostic tool. The lack of specific biomarkers is a tragic aspect for
      FM and chronic pain diseases in general. Interestingly, the endogenous opioid
      system is close to the immune one because of the expression of opioid receptors
      on lymphocytes membrane. Here we analyzed the role of the Mu opioid receptor on B
      lymphocytes as a specific biomarker for FM and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. We
      enrolled three groups of females: FM patients, OA patients (chronic pain control 
      group) and healthy subjects (pain-free negative control group). We collected
      blood samples to apply immunophenotyping analysis. Written tests were
      administrated for psychological analysis. Data were statistically analyzed. Final
      results showed that the percentage of Mu-positive B cells were statistically
      lower in FM and OA patients than in pain-free subjects. A low expression of
      Mu-positive B cell was not associated with the psychological characteristics
      investigated. In conclusion, here we propose the percentage of Mu-positive B
      cells as a biological marker for an objective diagnosis of chronic pain suffering
      patients, also contributing to the legitimacy of FM as a truly painful disease.

AB  - Background: Thoracic epidural analgesia is the standard postoperative pain
      management strategy in esophageal cancer surgery. However, paravertebral block
      analgesia may achieve comparable pain control while inducing less side effects,
      which may be beneficial for postoperative recovery. This study primarily aims to 
      compare the postoperative quality of recovery between paravertebral catheter
      versus thoracic epidural analgesia in patients undergoing minimally invasive
      esophagectomy. Methods: This study represents a randomized controlled superiority
      trial. A total of 192 patients will be randomized in 4 Dutch high-volume centers 
      for esophageal cancer surgery. Patients are eligible for inclusion if they are at
      least 18 years old, able to provide written informed consent and complete
      questionnaires in Dutch, scheduled to undergo minimally invasive esophagectomy
      with two-field lymphadenectomy and an intrathoracic anastomosis, and have no
      contra-indications to either epidural or paravertebral analgesia. The primary
      outcome is the quality of postoperative recovery, as measured by the Quality of
      Recovery-40 (QoR-40) questionnaire on the morning of postoperative day 3.
      Secondary outcomes include the QoR-40 questionnaire score Area Under the Curve on
      postoperative days 1–3, the integrated pain and systemic opioid score and patient
      satisfaction and pain experience according to the International Pain Outcomes
      (IPO) questionnaire, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, the groups will be
      compared regarding the need for additional rescue medication on postoperative
      days 0–3, technical failure of the pain treatment, duration of anesthesia,
      duration of surgery, total postoperative fluid administration day 0–3,
      postoperative vasopressor and inotrope use, length of urinary catheter use,
      length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, chronic pain at six months 
      after surgery, and other adverse effects. Discussion: In this study, it is
      hypothesized that paravertebral analgesia achieves comparable pain control while 
      causing less side-effects such as hypotension when compared to epidural
      analgesia, leading to shorter postoperative length of stay on a monitored ward
      and superior quality of recovery. If this hypothesis is confirmed, the results of
      this study can be used to update the relevant guidelines on postoperative pain
      management for patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy. Trial

TI  - Randomized trial comparing low-pressure versus standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum
      in laparoscopic colectomy: PAROS trial.
LID - 216
AB  - Background: Laparoscopy, by its minimally invasive nature, has revolutionized
      digestive and particularly colorectal surgery by decreasing post-operative pain, 
      morbidity, and length of hospital stay. In this trial, we aim to assess whether
      low pressure in laparoscopic colonic surgery (7 mm Hg instead of 12 mm Hg) could 
      further reduce pain, analgesic consumption, and morbidity, resulting in a shorter
      hospital stay. Methods and analysis: The PAROS trial is a phase III,
      double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We aim to recruit 138 patients
      undergoing laparoscopic colectomy. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      either a low-pressure group (7 mm Hg) or a standard-pressure group (12 mm Hg).
      The primary outcome will be a comparison of length of hospital stay between the
      two groups. Secondary outcomes will compare post-operative pain, consumption of
      analgesics, morbidity within 30 days, technical and oncological quality of the
      surgical procedure, time to passage of flatus and stool, and ambulation. All
      adverse events will be recorded. Analysis will be performed on an
      intention-to-treat basis. Trial registration: This research received the approval
      from the Committee for the Protection of Persons and was the subject of
      information to the ANSM. This search is saved in the ID-RCB database under
      registration number 2018-A03028–47. This research is retrospectively registered
      January 23, 2019, at http://clinicaltrials.gov/ed under the name “LaPAroscopic
      Low pRessure cOlorectal Surgery (PAROS)”. This trial is ongoing.

TI  - A Study of Opiate, Opiate Metabolites and Antihistamines in Urine after
      Consumption of Cold Syrups by LC-MS/MS.
LID - 972
AB  - Studying the origin of opiate and/or opiate metabolites in individual urine
      specimens after consumption of cold syrups is vital for patients, doctors, and
      law enforcement. A rapid liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method
      using “dilute-and-shoot” analysis without the need for extraction, hydrolysis
      and/or derivatization has been developed and validated. The approach provides
      linear ranges of 2.5–1000 ng mL−1 for 6-acetylmorphine, codeine,
      chlorpheniramine, and carbinoxamine, 2.5–800 ng mL−1 for morphine and
      morphine-3-β-d-glucuronide, and 2.5–600 ng mL−1 for morphine-6-β-d-glucuronide
      and codeine-6-β-d-glucuronide, with excellent correlation coefficients (R2 >
      0.995) and matrix effects (< 5%). Urine samples collected from the ten
      participants orally administered cold syrups were analyzed. The results concluded
      that participants consuming codeine-containing cold syrups did not routinely pass
      urine tests for opiates, and their morphine–codeine concentration ratios (M/C)
      were not always < 1. In addition, the distribution map of the clinical total
      concentration of the sum of morphine and codeine against the antihistamines
      (chlorpheniramine or carbinoxamine) were plotted for discrimination of people who
      used cold syrups. The 15 real cases have been studied by using M/C rule, cutoff
      value, and distribution map, further revealing a potential approach to determine 
      opiate metabolite in urine originating from cold syrups.

TI  - Cytotoxic Immunity in Peripheral Nerve Injury and Pain.
LID - 142
AB  - Cytotoxicity and consequent cell death pathways are a critical component of the
      immune response to infection, disease or injury. While numerous examples of
      inflammation causing neuronal sensitization and pain have been described, there
      is a growing appreciation of the role of cytotoxic immunity in response to
      painful nerve injury. In this review we highlight the functions of cytotoxic
      immune effector cells, focusing in particular on natural killer (NK) cells, and
      describe the consequent action of these cells in the injured nerve as well as
      other chronic pain conditions and peripheral neuropathies. We describe how
      targeted delivery of cytotoxic factors via the immune synapse operates alongside 
      Wallerian degeneration to allow local axon degeneration in the absence of cell
      death and is well-placed to support the restoration of homeostasis within the
      nerve. We also summarize the evidence for the expression of endogenous ligands
      and receptors on injured nerve targets and infiltrating immune cells that
      facilitate direct neuro-immune interactions, as well as modulation of the
      surrounding immune milieu. A number of chronic pain and peripheral neuropathies
      appear comorbid with a loss of function of cellular cytotoxicity suggesting such 
      mechanisms may actually help to resolve neuropathic pain. Thus while the immune
      response to peripheral nerve injury is a major driver of maladaptive pain, it is 
      simultaneously capable of directing resolution of injury in part through the
      pathways of cellular cytotoxicity. Our growing knowledge in tuning immune
      function away from inflammation toward recovery from nerve injury therefore holds
      promise for interventions aimed at preventing the transition from acute to
      chronic pain.

TI  - Unveiling the Impact of Morphine on Tamoxifen Metabolism in Mice in vivo.
LID - 25
AB  - Background: Tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancer and cancer recurrences.
      After administration, tamoxifen is converted into two more potent antitumor
      compounds, 4OH-tamoxifen and endoxifen by the CYP3A4/5 and 2D6 enzymes in human. 
      These active compounds are inactivated by the same UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
      isoforms as those involved in the metabolism of morphine. Importantly,
      cancer-associated pain can be treated with morphine, and the common metabolic
      pathway of morphine and tamoxifen suggests potential clinically relevant
      interactions.Methods: Mouse liver microsomes were used to determine the impact of
      morphine on 4OH-tamoxifen metabolism in vitro. For in vivo experiments, female
      mice were first injected with tamoxifen alone and then with tamoxifen and
      morphine. Blood was collected, and LC-MS/MS was used to quantify tamoxifen,
      4OH-tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, endoxifen, 4OH-tamoxifen-glucuronide, and
      endoxifen-glucuronide.Results:In vitro, we found increased Km values for the
      production of 4OH-tamoxifen-glucuronide in the presence of morphine, suggesting
      an inhibitory effect on 4OH-tamoxifen glucuronidation. Conversely, in vivo
      morphine treatment decreased 4OH-tamoxifen levels in the blood while dramatically
      increasing the formation of inactive metabolites 4OH-tamoxifen-glucuronide and
      endoxifen-glucuronide.Conclusions: Our findings emphasize the need for caution
      when extrapolating results from in vitro metabolic assays to in vivo drug
      metabolism interactions. Importantly, morphine strongly impacts tamoxifen
      metabolism in mice. It suggests that tamoxifen efficiency could be reduced when
      both drugs are co-administered in a clinical setting, e.g., to relieve pain in
      breast cancer patients. Further studies are needed to assess the potential for
      tamoxifen-morphine metabolic interactions in humans.

TI  - Six-month retention and changes in quality of life and substance use from a
      low-threshold methadone maintenance therapy programme in Durban, South Africa.
LID - 13
AB  - Background: Emerging data points to a potential heroin use epidemic in South
      Africa. Despite this, access to methadone maintenance therapy and other
      evidence-based treatment options remains negligible. We aimed to assess
      retention, changes in substance use and quality of life after 6 months on
      methadone maintenance therapy provided through a low-threshold service in Durban,
      South Africa. Methods: We enrolled a cohort of 54 people with an opioid use
      disorder into the study. We reviewed and described baseline socio-demographic
      characteristics. Baseline and 6-month substance use was assessed using the World 
      Health Organization’s Alcohol Smoking and Substance Use Involvement Screening
      Test (ASSIST) and quality of life, using the SF-12. We compared changes at
      6 months on methadone to baseline using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and
      paired-tests for the ASSIST and SF-12 scores, respectively. McNemar’s test was
      used for comparisons between paired results of categorical variables relating to 
      injecting frequency. Results: The majority of the participants were young, Black 
      African males, with a history of drug use spanning over 10 years. Retention after
      6 months was 81%. After 6 months, the median heroin ASSIST score decreased from
      37 to 9 (p < 0.0001) and the cannabis ASSIST score increased from 12.5 to 21
      (p = 0.0003). The median mental health composite score of the SF-12 increased
      from 41.4 to 48.7 (p = 0.0254). Conclusions: Interim findings suggest high
      retention, significant reductions in heroin use and improvements in mental health
      among participants retained on methadone maintenance therapy for 6 months.
      Further research into longer term outcomes and the reasons contributing to these 
      changes would strengthen recommendations for the scale-up of methadone
      maintenance therapy in South Africa.

TI  - The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σVreI is active during infection and
      contributes to phosphate starvation-induced virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
LID - 3139
AB  - The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σVreI of the human pathogen
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes transcription of potential virulence
      determinants, including secretion systems and secreted proteins. Its activity is 
      modulated by the VreR anti-σ factor that inhibits the binding of σVreI to the RNA
      polymerase in the absence of a (still unknown) inducing signal. The vreI-vreR
      genes are expressed under inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation, a physiological
      condition often encountered in the host that increases P. aeruginosa
      pathogenicity. However, whether or not σVreI is active in vivo during infection
      and contributes to the Pi starvation-induced virulence of this pathogen has not
      been analyzed yet. Using zebrafish embryos and a human alveolar basal epithelial 
      cell line as P. aeruginosa hosts, we demonstrate in this work that σVreI is
      active during infection and that lack of σVreI considerably reduces the Pi
      starvation-induced virulence of this pathogen. Surprisingly, lack of the σVreI
      inhibitor, the VreR anti-σ factor, also diminishes the virulence of P.
      aeruginosa. By transcriptomic analyses we show that VreR modulates gene
      expression not only in a σVreI-dependent but also in a σVreI-independent manner. 
      This includes potential virulence determinants and transcriptional regulators
      that could be responsible for the reduced virulence of the ΔvreR mutant.

TI  - Deficits in pain medication in older adults with chronic pain receiving home
      care: A cross-sectional study in Germany.
LID - e0229229
AB  - Objective: To analyze the pattern and appropriateness of pain medications in
      older adults receiving home care. Methods: We performed a prospective
      cross-sectional study in patients ≥65 years old having chronic pain and receiving
      home care in Berlin, Germany. Data on prescribed pain medications were collected 
      using self-reported information, nursing documents, and medication plans during
      interviews at home. Pain intensity was determined with the numeric rating scale
      (NRS) and the Pain Assessment In Advanced dementia (PAINAD) scale. The Pain
      Medication Appropriateness Scale score (SPMAS) was applied to evaluate
      inappropriateness (i.e. a score ≤67) of pain medication. Results: Overall 322
      patients with a mean age of 82.1 ± 7.4 years (71.4% females) were evaluated. The 
      average pain intensity scores during the last 24 hours were 5.3 ± 2.1 and 2.3 ±
      2.3 on NRS and PAINAD scale (range 0–10, respectively). Sixty (18.6%) patients
      did not receive any pain medication. Among the treated patients, dipyrone was the
      most frequently prescribed analgesic (71.4%), while 50.8% and 19.1% received
      systemic treatment with opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      respectively. The observed median SPMAS was 47.6 (range 0–100) with 58 (18.0%) of
      patients achieving appropriate values. Half of the patients were treated with
      scheduled, while 29.9% were only treated with on-demand medications. Cognitive
      status had no effect on appropriateness of pain treatment. Conclusions: We
      observed substantial deficits in dosing patterns and appropriateness of pain
      medication in older adults with pain receiving home care. This applied to both
      patients with and without severe cognitive impairment.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of acupuncture on relieving abdominal pain and distension for
      acute pancreatitis: A protocol for systematic review.
LID - e19044
AB  - Introduction:: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of acupuncture on relieving abdominal pain and distension in acute pancreatitis. 
      Methods and analysis:: We will electronically search PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web
      of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, China National
      Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical Literature Database, China Science
      Journal Database, and Wanfang Database from their inception. Furthermore, we will
      manually retrieve other resources, including reference lists of identified
      publications, conference articles, and gray literature. The clinical randomized
      controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials related to acupuncture
      treating acute pancreatitis will be included in the study. The language is
      limited to Chinese and English. Research selection, data extraction, and research
      quality assessment will be independently completed by 2 researchers. Data will be
      synthesized using a fixed effects model or random effects model depending on the 
      heterogeneity test. The overall response rate and the visual analog scale score
      will be the primary outcomes. The time of first bowel sound, the time of first
      defecation, the length of hospitalization, acute physiology and chronic health
      evaluation II score, and the adverse events will also be assessed as secondary
      outcomes. RevMan 5 (version 5.3) statistical software will be used for
      meta-analysis, and the level of evidence will be assessed by Grading of
      Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Continuous data will be 
      expressed in the form of weighted mean difference or standardized mean difference
      with 95% confidence intervals, whereas dichotomous data will be expressed in the 
      form of risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Ethics and dissemination:: The
      protocol of this systematic review does not require ethical approval because it
      does not involve humans. We will publish this article in peer-reviewed journals
      and present at relevant conferences. PROSPERO registration number::
      CRD42019147503.

TI  - Custom-Made Foot Orthoses Reduce Pain and Fatigue in Patients with Ehlers-Danlos 
      Syndrome. A Pilot Study.
LID - 1359
AB  - Background: Pain and fatigue are major clinical manifestations in patients with
      Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). The aim of this study is to measure change of the
      effects of custom-made foot orthotics on some manifestations related to EDS, such
      as foot pain, foot functionality, fatigue, and quality of life. Methods:
      Thirty-six patients with EDS wore foot orthoses for three months. Foot pain,
      foot-related disability, foot functionality, fatigue, and quality of life were
      measured using the 11-point Numeric Rating Scale, the Manchester Foot Pain and
      Disability Index, the Foot Function Index, the Fatigue Severity Score, and the
      12-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaires, respectively, at the beginning
      and after 3 months. Results: Participants demonstrated significantly improved
      foot pain (p = 0.002), disability related to foot pain (p < 0.001), foot
      functionality (p = 0.001), fatigue (p < 0.007), and mental health-related quality
      of life (p = 0.016). The physical health-related quality of life did not show
      significant changes. Conclusions: The use of custom-made foot orthoses help in
      the management of the symptoms by participants. This study could contribute to
      the foot specialists being considered as an additional member in
      multidisciplinary teams that are trying to develop an approach for patients with 
      EDS.

TI  - Healing effect of Quercus persica and Lawsonia inermis ointment on episiotomy
      wounds in primiparous women.
LID - 11
AB  - Background:: Episiotomy is one of the most common surgical interventions
      performed to facilitate delivery. Anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects of 
      Persian oak (Quercus persica) and henna (Lawsonia inermis) have been proved in
      previous studies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Q. persica
      and L. inermis ointment on episiotomy wound healing in primiparous women and
      comparing it with placebo group. Materials and Methods:: This was a double-blind 
      clinical trial conducted on 160 primiparous women who underwent episiotomy. The
      cases were randomly selected and divided into four groups of forty patients
      including control, placebo, those who consume topical henna, and those who
      consume topical Persian oak ointment. Pain and recovery assessment was done at
      baseline and 7th, 10th, and 14th days after birth and measured by Redness, Edema,
      Ecchymosis, Discharge, and Approximation (REEDA scale) and patients’ pain
      intensity was also measured by a visual analog scale (VAS). The collected data
      were analyzed using Chi-square test, one-way ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA
      test by SPSS (version 22). Results:: The results revealed that according to the
      reduced score of REEDA till the 14th day after the delivery, the wound healing in
      the henna group and the oak group (−2.58 ± 0.29 and − 2.04 ± 0.31, respectively) 
      was higher than the control and placebo groups (−1.62 ± 0.34 and − 1.95 ± 0.32,
      respectively) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, on the 14th day, the mean VAS score was
      not significantly different between henna and oak groups (henna group: 2.58 ±
      0.25 and oak group: 2.23 ± 0.18); however, both intervention groups had a
      significant difference with the placebo and control groups (P < 0.05).
      Conclusion:: The findings showed that the use of henna and oak ointment improves 
      episiotomy wound healing process, so it is recommended for primiparous women.

TI  - Aspirin and fracture risk: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis of
      observational studies.
LID - e026876
AB  - Objectives: This review provides insights into the potential for aspirin to
      preserve bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce fracture risk, building knowledge 
      of the risk-benefit profile of aspirin. Methods: We conducted a systematic review
      and exploratory meta-analysis of observational studies. Electronic searches of
      MEDLINE and Embase, and a manual search of bibliographies was undertaken for
      studies published to 28 March 2018. Studies were included if: participants were
      men or women aged ≥18 years; the exposure of interest was aspirin; and relative
      risks, ORs and 95% CIs for the risk of fracture or difference (percentage or
      absolute) in BMD (measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) between aspirin
      users and non-users were presented. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna
      Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists for observational studies. Pooled 
      ORs for any fracture and standardised mean differences (SMDs) for BMD outcomes
      were calculated using random-effects models. Results: Twelve studies met the
      inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Aspirin use was
      associated with a 17% lower odds for any fracture (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99; 
      I2=71%; six studies; n=511 390). Aspirin was associated with a higher total hip
      BMD for women (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.07; I2=0%; three studies; n=9686) and 
      men (SMD 0.06, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.13, I2=0%; two studies; n=4137) although these
      associations were not significant. Similar results were observed for lumbar spine
      BMD in women (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.09; I2=34%; four studies; n=11 330) and
      men (SMD 0.08; 95% CI −0.01 to 0.18; one study; n=432). Conclusions: While the
      benefits of reduced fracture risk and higher BMD from aspirin use may be modest
      for individuals, if confirmed in prospective controlled trials, they may confer a
      large population benefit given the common use of aspirin in older people.

TI  - Opioid losses in terms of dosage and value, January 2012 to September 2017: a
      retrospective analysis of Health Canada data.
PG  - E113-9
AB  - Background:: Canadian health care facilities must report losses or thefts of
      opioids to Health Canada. To broaden the understanding of opioid loss in Canada, 
      we analyzed data describing these losses to estimate the amount of opioid lost,
      estimate the wholesale and street value, compare the distribution of loss types
      between facility types and compare loss trends. Methods:: We analyzed Health
      Canada records of losses of codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine and
      oxycodone reported by Canadian facilities from January 2012 to September 2017. We
      conducted descriptive analyses of the opioid losses by calculating milligrams of 
      drug lost, oral morphine equivalents, daily defined doses, approximate wholesale 
      value and approximate street value, and compared loss trends when counted by
      incidents, dosage units or milligrams. Results:: There were 64 963 reports of
      loss of codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine or oxycodone over the study
      period. Over 112 kg of opioids were lost, an estimated $8.7 million in wholesale 
      cost and $136 million in street value. The dominant loss categories varied by
      facility type: armed robbery (30.9 kg [31.1%]) for community pharmacies,
      unexplained losses (6.4 kg [55.8%]) for companies and pilferage (0.8 kg [57.4%]) 
      for hospitals. Loss trends over the study period varied by reporting metric and
      facility type: community pharmacy losses increased when measured by dosage units 
      and incidents of loss, and remained stable when measured by milligrams; hospital 
      losses increased when measured by milligrams and showed no clear trend when
      measured by dosage units and incidents of loss. Companies showed no clear loss
      trend with any reporting metric. Interpretation:: Large quantities of opioids
      were lost or stolen from community pharmacies, companies and hospitals over the
      study period, and these losses are valued in millions of dollars. Publishing
      milligrams of opioids lost annually alongside metrics such as dosage units and
      incidents of loss would help characterize the economic cost and the magnitude of 
      drug losses.

TI  - Keel bone fractures induce a depressive-like state in laying hens.
LID - 3007
AB  - In commercial flocks of laying hens, keel bone fractures (KBFs) are prevalent and
      associated with behavioural indicators of pain. However, whether their impact is 
      severe enough to induce a depressive-like state of chronic stress is unknown. As 
      chronic stress downregulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in mammals and 
      birds, we employ this measure as a neural biomarker of subjective welfare state. 
      Radiographs obtained longitudinally from Lohmann Brown laying hens housed in a
      commercial multi-tier aviary were used to score the severity of
      naturally-occurring KBFs between the ages of 21–62 weeks. Individual birds’
      transitions between aviary zones were also recorded. Focal hens with severe KBFs 
      at 3–4 weeks prior to sampling (n = 15) had lower densities of immature
      doublecortin-positive (DCX+) multipolar and bipolar neurons in the hippocampal
      formation than focal hens with minimal fractures (n = 9). KBF severity scores at 
      this time also negatively predicted DCX+ cell numbers on an individual level,
      while hens that acquired fractures earlier in their lives had fewer DCX+ neurons 
      in the caudal hippocampal formation. Activity levels 3–4 weeks prior to sampling 
      were not associated with AHN. KBFs thus lead to a negative affective state
      lasting at least 3–4 weeks, and management steps to reduce their occurrence are
      likely to have significant welfare benefits.

TI  - Opioids depress breathing through two small brainstem sites.
LID - e52694
AB  - The rates of opioid overdose in the United States quadrupled between 1999 and
      2017, reaching a staggering 130 deaths per day. This health epidemic demands
      innovative solutions that require uncovering the key brain areas and cell types
      mediating the cause of overdose— opioid-induced respiratory depression. Here, we 
      identify two primary changes to murine breathing after administering opioids.
      These changes implicate the brainstem’s breathing circuitry which we confirm by
      locally eliminating the µ-Opioid receptor. We find the critical brain site is the
      preBötzinger Complex, where the breathing rhythm originates, and use genetic
      tools to reveal that just 70–140 neurons in this region are responsible for its
      sensitivity to opioids. Future characterization of these neurons may lead to
      novel therapies that prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.

TI  - A medical mystery of complex regional pain syndrome.
LID - e03329
AB  - Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a condition of neuropathic pain, which
      is characterized by significant autonomic and inflammatory features. CRPS occurs 
      in patients who have limb surgery, limb fractures, or trauma. Many patients may
      have pain resolve within twelve months of the inciting incident; however, a small
      subset progresses to the chronic form. This transitional process often happens by
      changing from warm CRPS with dominant inflammatory phase to cold CRPS, in which
      autonomic characteristics or manifestations dominate. Several peripheral and
      central mechanisms are involved, which might vary among individuals over a period
      of time. Other contributors include peripheral and central sensitization,
      autonomic alterations, inflammatory and immune changes, neurochemical changes,
      and psychological and genetic factors. Although effective management of the
      chronic CRPS form is often challenging, there are a few high quality randomized
      controlled trials that support the efficacy of the most commonly used therapeutic
      approaches.

TI  - The effectiveness of additional thoracic paravertebral block in improving the
      anesthetic effects of regional anesthesia for proximal humeral fracture surgery
      in elderly patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 204
AB  - Background: The innervation of the shoulder-upper-extremity area is complicated
      and unclear. Regional anesthesia with a brachial plexus and cervical plexus block
      is probably inadequate for the proximal humeral surgery. Missing blockade of the 
      T1–T2 nerves may be the reason. We conduct this prospective randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) to explore whether an additional T2 thoracic paravertebral block
      (TPVB) can improve the success rate of regional anesthesia for elderly patients
      in proximal humeral fracture surgery. Methods/design: The patients aged 65 years 
      or older, referred for anterior-approach proximal humeral fracture surgery, will 
      be enrolled. Each patient will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a combined
      interscalene brachial plexus with superficial cervical plexus block (IC)
      (combined interscalene brachial plexus with superficial cervical plexus block) or
      an IC block combined with thoracic paravertebral block (ICTP) block (combined
      thoracic paravertebral block with brachial plexus and superficial cervical plexus
      block). The primary outcome is the success rate of regional anesthesia without
      rescue analgesic methods. The secondary outcomes are as follows: sensory block at
      the surgical area, proportion of patients who need rescue anesthesia
      (intravenously administered remifentanil or conversion to general anesthesia),
      cumulative doses of intraoperative vasoactive medications and adverse events. The
      total sample size is estimated to be 80 patients. Discussion: This RCT aims to
      confirm whether an additional T2 TPVB can provide better anesthetic effects of
      regional anesthesia with brachial and cervical plexus block in elderly patients
      undergoing proximal humeral surgery. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: 
      NCT03919422. Registered on 19 April 2019.

TI  - Functional connectivity and structural analysis of trial spinal cord stimulation 
      responders in failed back surgery syndrome.
LID - e0228306
AB  - Background: Chronic pain has been associated with alterations in brain structure 
      and function that appear dependent on pain phenotype. Functional connectivity
      (FC) data on chronic back pain (CBP) is limited and based on heterogeneous pain
      populations. We hypothesize that failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients
      being considered for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy have altered resting
      state (RS) FC cross-network patterns that 1) specifically involve emotion and
      reward/aversion functions and 2) are related to pain scores. Methods: RS
      functional MRI (fMRI) scans were obtained for 10 FBSS patients who are being
      considered for but who have not yet undergone implantation of a permanent SCS
      device and 12 healthy age-matched controls. Seven RS networks were analyzed
      including the striatum (STM). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test evaluated differences
      in cross-network FC strength (FCS). Differences in periaqueductal grey (PAG) FC
      were assessed with seed-based analysis. Results: Cross-network FCS was decreased 
      (p<0.05) between the STM and all other networks in these FBSS patients. There was
      a negative linear relationship (R2 = 0.76, p<0.0022) between STMFCS index and
      pain scores. The PAG showed decreased FC with network elements and amygdala but
      increased FC with the sensorimotor cortex and cingulate gyrus. Conclusions:
      Decreased FC between STM and other RS networks in FBSS has not been previously
      reported. This STMFCS index may represent a more objective measure of chronic
      pain specific to FBSS which may help guide patient selection for SCS and
      subsequent management.

TI  - Current Advances in Allosteric Modulation of Muscarinic Receptors.
LID - 325
AB  - Allosteric modulators are ligands that bind to a site on the receptor that is
      spatially separated from the orthosteric binding site for the endogenous
      neurotransmitter. Allosteric modulators modulate the binding affinity, potency,
      and efficacy of orthosteric ligands. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are
      prototypical allosterically-modulated G-protein-coupled receptors. They are a
      potential therapeutic target for the treatment of psychiatric, neurologic, and
      internal diseases like schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington disease,
      type 2 diabetes, or chronic pulmonary obstruction. Here, we reviewed the progress
      made during the last decade in our understanding of their mechanisms of binding, 
      allosteric modulation, and in vivo actions in order to understand the
      translational impact of studying this important class of pharmacological agents. 
      We overviewed newly developed allosteric modulators of muscarinic receptors as
      well as new spin-off ideas like bitopic ligands combining allosteric and
      orthosteric moieties and photo-switchable ligands based on bitopic agents.

TI  - Etorphine-Azaperone Immobilisation for Translocation of Free-Ranging Masai
      Giraffes (Giraffa Camelopardalis Tippelskirchi): A Pilot Study.
LID - 322
AB  - Simple Summary: Due to their peculiar anatomy and sensitivity to drugs, giraffes 
      are among the most challenging mammals to immobilise. Masai giraffes have
      recently been listed as endangered. Hence, their conservation needs actions that 
      require veterinary capture such as translocations. In this study, we evaluated a 
      new protocol of immobilisation for translocation of free-ranging Masai giraffes. 
      The hypothesis is that, by combining a potent opioid with a tranquiliser, it is
      possible to mitigate the capture stress, which is a major cause of disastrous
      homeostatic consequences, including capture myopathy and death. The combination
      produced, in all individuals, smooth and quick inductions and reliable
      immobilisations. Although hypoxaemia in a few individuals and acidosis were seen,
      the overall cardiorespiratory function was adequate. Whereas the initial stress
      to the capture was limited in the individuals, likely due to tourism-related
      habituation, the opioid-related excitement and resulting increased exertion was
      responsible for worse immobilisation and physiological derangement. A low dose of
      an antagonist was used and evaluated and, in the two-week boma follow-up, it
      proved to be efficient in providing safe recoveries and transport. At the
      investigated doses, the combination provided partially reversed immobilisation
      that allowed uneventful translocation in free-ranging Masai giraffes. Abstract:
      Etorphine-azaperone immobilisation was evaluated for translocation of Masai
      giraffes. Nine giraffes were darted with 0.012 ± 0.001 mg/kg etorphine and 0.07 ±
      0.01 mg/kg azaperone. Once ataxic, giraffes were roped for recumbency and
      restrained manually. Naltrexone (3 mg/mg etorphine) was immediately given
      intravenously to reverse etorphine-related side effects. Protocol evaluation
      included physiological monitoring, blood-gas analyses, anaesthetic times, and
      quality scores (1 = excellent, 4 = poor). Sedation onset and recumbency were
      achieved in 2.6 ± 0.8 and 5.6 ± 1.4 min. Cardio-respiratory function (HR = 70 ±
      16, RR = 32 ± 8, MAP = 132 ± 16) and temperature (37.8 ± 0.5) were stable.
      Arterial gas analysis showed hypoxaemia in some individuals (PaO2 = 67 ± 8 mmHg) 
      and metabolic acidosis (pH = 7.23 ± 0.05, PaCO2 = 34 ± 4 mmHg, HCO3− = 12.9 ± 1.2
      mmol/l). Minor startle response occurred, while higher induction-induced
      excitement correlated to longer inductions, worse restraint, and decreased HCO3−.
      After 19 ± 3.5 min of restraint, giraffes were allowed to stand and were loaded
      onto a chariot. Immobilisations were good and scored 2 (1–3). Inductions and
      recoveries were smooth and scored 1 (1–2). Translocations were uneventful and no 
      complications occurred in 14-days boma follow-up.

TI  - Efficacy of multimodal analgesia with perineural buprenorphine or dexmedetomidine
      for surgeries performed under ultrasound-guided infraclavicular brachial plexus
      block.
PG  - 66-71
AB  - Background and Aims:: Perineural adjuvants when used as a part of multimodal
      analgesia (MMA) will maximize the quality and duration of analgesia of the nerve 
      blocks. In the present study, we compared the duration of postoperative analgesia
      and other block characteristics of two groups of MMA comprising either perineural
      buprenorphine or dexmedetomidine in the upper limb surgeries performed under
      ultrasound-guided (US-guided) infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks. Material
      and Methods:: A total of 100 adult patients undergoing elective upper limb
      orthopedic surgery under US-guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block were
      randomly divided into two groups. Group I received 150 μg buprenorphine and Group
      II received 50 μg dexmedetomidine, perineurally added to 30 ml of 0.375%
      bupivacaine. Both groups also received tramadol 50 mg IV, dexamethasone 4 mg IV, 
      and diclofenac 75 mg infusion as part of MMA. Both groups were compared for the
      duration of postoperative analgesia, block characteristics, and incidence of
      adverse effects. Results:: The duration of postoperative analgesia was
      significantly prolonged in Group II (937.6 ± 179.1 min vs 1280.4 ± 288.8 min).
      The onset of sensory and motor blocks was shorter in Group II (P < 0.05). The
      duration of sensory and motor blocks was significantly prolonged in Group II (P <
      0.05). The number of rescue analgesics required in the first 24 hours was less in
      Group II (1.98 ± 0.62 vs 0.8 ± 0.64). Although heart rate and blood pressure
      levels were lower in Group II, all patients were hemodynamically stable.
      Conclusion:: For surgeries under brachial plexus block, perineural
      dexmedetomidine when used as a part of MMA provided a prolonged duration of
      postoperative analgesia and improved block characteristics than perineural
      buprenorphine.

TI  - Comparison of the efficacy of two doses of dexmedetomidine in attenuating the
      hemodynamic response to intubation in patients undergoing elective cardiac
      surgery: A randomized double-blinded study.
PG  - 83-7
AB  - Background and Aims:: Transient tachycardia and hypertension associated with
      laryngoscopy and intubation may be hazardous to patients presenting for cardiac
      surgery. The α 2 agonist dexmedetomidine may blunt this stress response, but the 
      optimal dose which will accomplish this without causing hypotension and
      bradycardia is not well established. The primary objective of this study was to
      compare the efficacy of two doses of dexmedetomidine (0.5 and 1 μg/kg) as a 15
      min infusion in attenuating the hemodynamic stress response to laryngoscopy and
      endotracheal intubation in elective cardiac surgery. Material and Methods::
      Seventy six patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery received a single
      preoperative dose of dexmedetomidine of either 0.5 μg/kg (low dose) or 1 μg/kg
      (high dose) as a 15-min infusion prior to induction. The hemodynamic response to 
      laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation (heart rate, systolic blood pressure,
      mean arterial pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) were recorded at different 
      times. Independent sample t-test, Chi-square test of association, and repeated
      measures analysis of variance were used to analyze the collected data. Results:: 
      The incidence of hypertension following intubation was significantly more in the 
      low-dose group. Administration of 1 μg/kg dexmedetomidine was not accompanied by 
      hypotension or bradycardia. Conclusion:: Dexmedetomidine in a dose of 1 μg/kg is 
      more effective than 0.5 μg/kg for attenuation of hemodynamic stress response to
      intubation in cardiac surgery. A more graded increase in the dose of
      dexmedetomidine may lead to an optimum dose in attenuating the hemodynamic
      response to intubation.

LID - e033815
AB  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sensorimotor 
      disorder among patients with end stage renal disease. This clinical trial aimed
      to provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of pramipexole in patients with
      uremic RLS receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods and analysis: This is a
      12-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial. In total, 104 patients with uremic RLS receiving PD will be enrolled from 
      four hospitals and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either placebo or
      pramipexole. We will determine the efficacy of pramipexole in the improvement of 
      International RLS Study Group Rating Scale as the primary outcome, while
      responder rates for other RLS scales at week 12, change from baseline to week 12 
      for psychological status, sleep disorder and quality of life and blood pressure
      represent the secondary outcomes. Ethics and dissemination: The study was
      approved by the ethics committees of Peking University First Hospital, Xinqiao
      hospital of Army Medical University, Cangzhou Center Hospital and Peking
      University Shenzhen Hospital. The results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed
      journals. Trial registration number: NCT03817554

TI  - High-flow nasal oxygenation versus standard oxygenation for gastrointestinal
      endoscopy with sedation. The prospective multicentre randomised controlled ODEPHI
      study protocol.
LID - e034701
AB  - Introduction: Hypoxaemia is a major complication during gastrointestinal
      endoscopy (GIE) procedures (upper/lower) when performed under deep sedation in
      the procedure room. Standard oxygen therapy (SOT) is used to prevent hypoxaemia. 
      Data suggest that risk factors for hypoxaemia under deep sedation during GIE are 
      obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, a body mass index above 30 kg/m², high blood
      pressure, diabetes, heart disease, age over 60 years old, high American Society
      of Anesthesiologists physical status class and the association of upper and lower
      GIE. High-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) may potentially improve oxygenation
      during GIE under deep sedation. We hypothesised that HFNO could decrease the
      incidence of hypoxaemia in comparison with SOT. Methods and analysis: The ODEPHI 
      (High-flow nasal oxygenation versus standard oxygenation for gastrointestinal
      endoscopy with sedation. The prospective multicentre randomised controlled) study
      is a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing HFNO to SOT during GIE
      (upper and/or lower) under deep sedation administered by anaesthesiologists in
      the procedure room. Three hundred and eighty patients will be randomised with a
      1:1 ratio in two parallel groups.The primary outcome is the occurrence of
      hypoxaemia, defined by a pulse oximetry measurement of peripheral capillary
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) below or equal to 92% during the GIE procedure.
      Secondary outcomes include prolonged hypoxaemia, severe hypoxaemia, need for
      manoeuvres to maintain upper airway patency and other adverse events. Ethics and 
      dissemination: This study has been approved by the ethics committee (CPP Sud Est 
      Paris V, France), and patients are included after informed consent. The results
      will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. As provided for by
      French law, patients participating in the study are informed that they have the
      possibility to ask the investigators, once the study is completed, to be informed
      of the overall results of the study. Thus, a summary of the results will be sent 
      by post to the participants on request. Trial registration number:

TI  - Experiences of people taking opioid medication for chronic non-malignant pain: a 
      qualitative evidence synthesis using meta-ethnography.
LID - e032988
AB  - Objective: To review qualitative studies on the experience of taking opioid
      medication for chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) or coming off them. Design: This
      is a qualitative evidence synthesis using a seven-step approach from the methods 
      of meta-ethnography. Data sources and eligibility criteria: We searched selected 
      databases—Medline, Embase, AMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
      Literature, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus (Science Citation Index and
      Social Science Citation Index)—for qualitative studies which provide patients’
      views of taking opioid medication for CNMP or of coming off them (June 2017,
      updated September 2018). Data extraction and synthesis: Papers were quality
      appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool, and the
      GRADE-CERQual (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
      working group - Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research)
      guidelines were applied. We identified concepts and iteratively abstracted these 
      concepts into a line of argument. Results: We screened 2994 unique citations and 
      checked 153 full texts, and 31 met our review criteria. We identified five
      themes: (1) reluctant users with little choice; (2) understanding opioids: the
      good and the bad; (3) a therapeutic alliance: not always on the same page; (4)
      stigma: feeling scared and secretive but needing support; and (5) the challenge
      of tapering or withdrawal. A new overarching theme of ‘constantly balancing’
      emerged from the data. Conclusions: People taking opioids were constantly
      balancing tensions, not always wanting to take opioids, and weighing the pros and
      cons of opioids but feeling they had no choice because of the pain. They
      frequently felt stigmatised, were not always ‘on the same page’ as their
      healthcare professional and felt changes in opioid use were often challenging.

TI  - Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Pain Management: A
      Systematic Narrative Review.
LID - 114
AB  - Recently, clinicians have been using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) for treating various pain conditions. This systematic narrative review
      aimed to examine the use and efficacy of rTMS for controlling various pain
      conditions. A PubMed search was conducted for articles that were published until 
      June 7, 2019 and used rTMS for pain alleviation. The key search phrase for
      identifying potentially relevant articles was (repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation AND pain). The following inclusion criteria were applied for article 
      selection: (1) patients with pain, (2) rTMS was applied for pain management, and 
      (3) follow-up evaluations were performed after rTMS stimulation to assess the
      reduction in pain. Review articles were excluded. Overall, 1,030 potentially
      relevant articles were identified. After reading the titles and abstracts and
      assessing eligibility based on the full-text articles, 106 publications were
      finally included in our analysis. Overall, our findings suggested that rTMS is
      beneficial for treating neuropathic pain of various origins, such as central
      pain, pain from peripheral nerve disorders, fibromyalgia, and migraine. Although 
      data on the use of rTMS for orofacial pain, including trigeminal neuralgia,
      phantom pain, low back pain, myofascial pain syndrome, pelvic pain, and complex
      regional pain syndrome, were promising, there was insufficient evidence to
      determine the efficacy of rTMS for treating these conditions. Therefore, further 
      studies are needed to validate the effects of rTMS on pain relief in these
      conditions. Overall, this review will help guide clinicians in making informed
      decisions regarding whether rTMS is an appropriate option for managing various
      pain conditions.

TI  - Acute Pancreatitis Due to Disseminated Varicella Zoster Infection in an
      Individual with Newly Diagnosed Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
LID - e7027
AB  - Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection is generally considered as a benign and
      self-limiting disease. However, individuals with VZV infection can have
      disseminated to various organs leading to serious complications, particularly in 
      adults. This pattern is more prevalent in immunosuppressed individuals.
      Disseminated varicella is historically known to involve the central nervous
      system (CNS), liver, and lungs. However, dissemination of varicella to the
      pancreas and subsequently causing acute pancreatitis has been rarely reported.We 
      present a case of disseminated varicella infection in a newly diagnosed human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient causing acute pancreatitis at initial
      disease presentation and subsequently leading to multi organ dysfunction.A
      42-year-old African American female who was initially being treated for
      Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) at an inner-city hospital developed severe
      epigastric pain radiating to back along with nausea on day 2 of admission.
      Physical findings revealed tachycardia, epigastric tenderness and newly formed
      vesicular rash involving the neck and face classical of varicella infection. Skin
      biopsy and serum sample confirmed varicella infection by VZV polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) test. Labs revealed elevated lipase, amylase at a level diagnostic
      of acute pancreatitis. The patient had no other risk factors for pancreatitis.
      She was started on intravenous Acyclovir and intravenous hydration with isotonic 
      normal saline. She was managed conservatively for other systemic complications.
      Pancreatitis resolved after five days of clinical presentation. She completed two
      weeks of Acyclovir, her condition steadily improved and she was successfully
      discharged home with no further recurrence.Acute pancreatitis is a rare
      infectious association of disseminated varicella infection. Clinicians should
      always be mindful of this infectious etiology as one of the rare differentials
      for acute pancreatitis as this is a treatable cause and could prevent morbidity, 
      mortality associated with this condition if treated timely.

TI  - The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Treatment Gap: A National Study of Substance Use 
      Disorder Treatment.
LID - 1178221820904150
AB  - Background:: Anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) use is associated with serious
      mental and physical health problems. Evidence indicates that AAS use among people
      who use psychoactive substances is higher than in the general population. This
      study aims to estimate lifetime AAS use among patients in substance use disorder 
      (SUD) treatment, compare characteristics of AAS and non-AAS users and identify
      whether AAS use was addressed during treatment. Methods:: This cross-sectional
      survey included 563 (142 women, 24.2%) patients in 38 SUD treatment facilities in
      Norway. Respondents reported on AAS and substance use, and treatment experiences.
      Results:: Lifetime AAS use was reported by 156 (28.3%) SUD patients, thereof
      35.6% of the men and 8.0% of the women. Lifetime AAS use was highest among men
      with stimulants (55.8%) as preferred substance, and lowest among men who
      preferred alcohol (14.6%). Initiation of AAS use due to getting thinner following
      substance use was reported by 44.5% of the AAS using men. AAS users reported more
      severe substance use than non-AAS users. More than half (58%) of all patients had
      not been asked about AAS use, and 42.4% of those who were asked, experienced that
      treatment providers lacked expertise about AAS. Conclusion:: Lifetime AAS use in 
      this sample of SUD patients is common practice and comprise an underrecognized
      problem in SUD treatment. Given the deleterious implications to the individual
      and society that concomitant use of AAS may cause, it would be essential to raise
      the awareness about AAS use among SUD patients, and the level of competence among
      health professionals.

TI  - Timing is everything: Early do-not-resuscitate orders in the intensive care unit 
      and patient outcomes.
LID - e0227971
AB  - Background: The use of Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders has increased but many are
      placed late in the dying process. This study is to determine the association
      between the timing of DNR order placement in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
      nurses’ perceptions of patients’ distress and quality of death. Methods: 200 ICU 
      patients and the nurses (n = 83) who took care of them during their last week of 
      life were enrolled from the medical ICU and cardiac care unit of New York
      Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan and the surgical ICU at
      the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Nurses were interviewed about their
      perceptions of the patients’ quality of death using validated measures. Patients 
      were divided into 3 groups—no DNR, early DNR, late DNR placement during the
      patient’s final ICU stay. Logistic regression analyses modeled perceived patient 
      quality of life as a function of timing of DNR order placement. Patient’s
      comorbidities, length of ICU stay, and procedures were also included in the
      model. Results: 59 patients (29.5%) had a DNR placed within 48 hours of ICU
      admission (early DNR), 110 (55%) placed after 48 hours of ICU admission (late
      DNR), and 31 (15.5%) had no DNR order placed. Compared to patients without DNR
      orders, those with an early but not late DNR order placement had significantly
      fewer non-beneficial procedures and lower odds of being rated by nurses as not
      being at peace (Adjusted Odds Ratio namely AOR = 0.30; [CI = 0.09–0.94]), and
      experiencing worst possible death (AOR = 0.31; [CI = 0.1–0.94]) before
      controlling for procedures; and consistent significance in severe suffering (AOR 
      = 0.34; [CI = 0.12–0.96]), and experiencing a severe loss of dignity (AOR = 0.33;
      [CI = 0.12–0.94]), controlling for non-beneficial procedures. Conclusions:
      Placement of DNR orders within the first 48 hours of the terminal ICU admission
      was associated with fewer non-beneficial procedures and less perceived suffering 
      and loss of dignity, lower odds of being not at peace and of having the worst
      possible death.

TI  - Compliance of private pharmacies in Uganda with controlled prescription drugs
      regulations: a mixed-methods study.
LID - 16
AB  - Background: Controlled prescription drug use disorders are a growing global
      health challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. Effective supply chain regulations on
      dispensing and stock control are important for controlling this epidemic. Since
      compliance with these regulations in resource-limited countries is poor, there is
      need to understand its predictors in order to reduce the risk of prescription
      drug use disorders. Methods: A mixed-methods study utilizing a structured
      questionnaire and a simulated client guide was undertaken in Kampala and Mbale
      towns in Uganda. The questionnaire recorded self-reported dispensing and verified
      stock control practices and their covariates from 101 private pharmacies. The
      guide recorded actual dispensing practices from 27 pharmacies. Snowball sampling 
      was done to enrich the sample with pharmacies that stock opioids. The mean
      compliance with good dispensing and stock control practices was calculated.
      Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of 
      compliance. Results: The mean compliance with dispensing and stock control
      requirements was 82.9% and 23%, respectively. Twenty percent and 40% of the
      pharmacies dispensed pethidine without a prescription and with invalid
      prescriptions, respectively. Having a pharmacist on duty (OR = 5.17; p = 0.02),
      prior in-service training on narcotics regulations (OR = 3.51; p = 0.04), and
      previous narcotics audits by the regulator (OR = 5.11; p = 0.01) were independent
      predictors of compliance with stock control requirements. Pharmacies with a
      previous history of poor compliance with dispensing requirements were less likely
      to demonstrate good compliance (OR = 0.21; p = 0.01). Conclusions: There is
      suboptimal compliance to controlled prescription drug regulations among Uganda’s 
      pharmacies. A previous history of poor compliance to dispensing requirements
      predicted low compliance in subsequent assessments. Training and regulatory
      audits increased compliance in stock control but not dispensing. Expansion of
      training and audits to more pharmacies and/or incentives for compliance are
      necessary.

TI  - Network Pharmacology Study on the Pharmacological Mechanism of Cinobufotalin
      Injection against Lung Cancer.
LID - 1246742
AB  - Cinobufotalin injection, extracted from the skin of Chinese giant salamander or
      black sable, has good clinical effect against lung cancer. However, owing to its 
      complex composition, the pharmacological mechanism of cinobufotalin injection has
      not been fully clarified. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of action of 
      cinobufotalin injection against lung cancer using network pharmacology and
      bioinformatics. Compounds of cinobufotalin injection were determined by
      literature retrieval, and potential therapeutic targets of cinobufotalin
      injection were screened from Swiss Target Prediction and STITCH databases.
      Lung-cancer-related genes were summarized from GeneCards, OMIM, and DrugBank
      databases. The pharmacological mechanism of cinobufotalin injection against lung 
      cancer was determined by enrichment analysis of gene ontology and Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and protein-protein interaction network was
      constructed. We identified 23 compounds and 506 potential therapeutic targets of 
      cinobufotalin injection, as well as 70 genes as potential therapeutic targets of 
      cinobufotalin injection in lung cancer by molecular docking. The antilung cancer 
      effect of cinobufotalin injection was shown to involve cell cycle, cell
      proliferation, antiangiogenesis effect, and immune inflammation pathways, such as
      PI3K-Akt, VEGF, and the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In network
      analysis, the hub targets of cinobufotalin injection against lung cancer were
      identified as VEGFA, EGFR, CCND1, CASP3, and AKT1. A network diagram of
      “drug-compounds-target-pathway” was constructed through network pharmacology to
      elucidate the pharmacological mechanism of the antilung cancer effect of
      cinobufotalin injection, which is conducive to guiding clinical medication.

TI  - Open-label placebo treatment of women with premenstrual syndrome: study protocol 
      of a randomised controlled trial.
LID - e032868
AB  - Introduction: Recent evidence suggests that for certain clinical conditions,
      placebos can improve clinical outcomes even without deception. These so-called
      open-label placebos (OLPs) bear the advantage of a significant lower risk of
      adverse events and comply with ethical principles. Although premenstrual syndrome
      (PMS) seems to be considerably susceptible to placebo effects, no study has
      examined open-OLP responses on PMS. Methods and analysis: To test the efficacy of
      OLPs in women suffering from PMS, a clinical randomised controlled trial
      including two OLP study groups (with and without treatment rationale) was
      designed to investigate on the effect on PMS. PMS symptoms are monitored on a
      daily basis via a symptom diary, adverse events are monitored intermittently. The
      study started in spring 2018 and patients will be included until a maximum of 150
      participants are randomised. Besides the primary outcome PMS symptom intensity
      and interference, an array of further variables is assessed. Multilevel modelling
      will be used for data analyses. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was
      obtained from the Ethics Committee Northwest and Central Switzerland. Results of 
      the main analysis and of secondary analyses will be submitted for publication in 
      peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration numbers: (1) ClinicalTrials.gov
      (NCT03547661); (2) Swiss national registration (SNCTP000002809).

TI  - Risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations: a qualitative study of the perspectives of Australian general
      practitioners.
LID - e034363
AB  - Objective: To explore the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) concerning 
      the risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations. Design: A qualitative approach using semistructured telephone
      interviews. Analysis used an integrative approach. Setting: Primary care.
      Participants: Australian GPs with experience of prescribing opioids for people
      with cancer and pain. Results: Twenty-two GPs participated, and three themes
      emerged. Theme 1 (Misuse is not the main problem) contextualised misuse as a
      relatively minor concern compared with pain control and toxicity, and highlighted
      underlying systemic factors, including limitations in continuity of care and
      doctor expertise. Theme 2 (‘A different mindset’ for cancer pain) captured
      participants’ relative comfort in prescribing opioids for pain in cancer versus
      non-cancer contexts, and acknowledgement that compassion and greater perceived
      community acceptance were driving factors, in addition to scientific support for 
      mechanisms and clinical efficacy. Participant attitudes towards prescribing for
      people with cancer versus non-cancer pain differed most when cancer was in the
      palliative phase, when they were unconcerned by misuse. Participants were
      equivocal about the risk–benefit ratio of long-term opioid therapy in the chronic
      phase of cancer, and were reluctant to prescribe for disease-free survivors.
      Theme 3 (‘The question is always, ‘how lazy have you been?’) captured
      participants’ acknowledgement that they sometimes prescribed opioids for cancer
      pain as a default, easier option compared with more holistic pain management.
      Conclusions: Findings highlight the role of specific clinical considerations in
      distinguishing risk of opioid misuse in the cancer versus non-cancer population, 
      rather than diagnosis per se. Further efforts are needed to ensure continuity of 
      care where opioid prescribing is shared. Greater evidence is needed to guide
      opioid prescribing in disease-free survivors and the chronic phase of cancer,
      especially in the context of new treatments for metastatic disease.

TI  - The Modified WHO Analgesic Ladder: Is It Appropriate for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain?
PG  - 411-7
AB  - Introduction: From 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder has
      been used as the simple and valuable pain-relieving guidance in the
      pharmaceutical pain management, however, with the development of medical history,
      notions about pain physiology and pain management have already updated. Is the
      analgesic ladder still appropriate for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) patients?
      This study aims to analyse the current usage of the analgesic ladder in patients 
      with CNCP by evaluating previously published pertinent studies. Methods:
      Literature published in English from January 1980 to April 2019 and cited on
      PubMed database was included. Analysis on the analgesic ladder, current status of
      CNCP management, and a new revised ladder model were developed based on relevant 
      literature. Results: The WHO analgesic ladder for cancer pain is not appropriate 
      for current CNCP management. It is revised into a four-step ladder: the
      integrative therapies being adopted at each step for reducing or even stopping
      the use of opioid analgesics; interventional therapies being considered as step 3
      before upgrading to strong opioids if non-opioids and weak opioids failed in CNCP
      management. Discussion: A simple and valuable guideline in past years, the WHO
      analgesic ladder is inappropriate for the current use of CNCP control. A revised 
      four-step analgesic ladder aligned with integrative medicine principles and
      minimally invasive interventions is recommended for control of CNCP.

TI  - Is marijuana use associated with decreased use of prescription opioids?
      Toxicological findings from two US national samples of drivers.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: State governments in the United States are increasingly viewing
      marijuana legalization as a policy option for controlling the opioid epidemic
      under the premise that marijuana is a less harmful substitute for opioids. The
      purpose of this study is to assess whether marijuana use is associated with
      decreased odds of prescription opioid use. Methods: A cross-sectional study
      design was applied to toxicological testing data from two national samples of
      drivers: 1) the 2011–2016 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and 2) the
      2013–2014 National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers (NRS).
      Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated from
      multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of 
      marijuana use with prescription opioid use and alcohol use. Results: Among the
      47,602 drivers from the FARS, 15.7% tested positive for marijuana and 6.9%
      positive for prescription opioids. Compared with drivers testing negative for
      marijuana, those testing positive for marijuana were 28% more likely to test
      positive for prescription opioids (adjusted OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.15–1.42). Among
      the 7881 drivers from the NRS, 7.9% tested positive for marijuana and 4.5%
      positive for prescription opioids. Relative to drivers testing negative for
      marijuana, those testing positive for marijuana were twice as likely to test
      positive for prescription opioids (adjusted OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.29–3.20). In
      both study samples, marijuana use was associated with significantly increased
      odds of alcohol positivity. Conclusions: Drivers who test positive for marijuana 
      are significantly more likely to test positive for prescription opioids.
      Longitudinal studies with rigorous designs and toxicological testing data are
      needed to further address the substitution hypothesis between marijuana and
      prescription opioids.

TI  - The opioid mortality epidemic in North America: do we understand the supply side 
      dynamics of this unprecedented crisis?
LID - 14
AB  - While there has been extensive attention to the ‘demand side’ – or use and
      adverse consequences, including mortality – of the ‘opioid crisis’ presently
      unfolding across North America, few considerations have focused on the supply
      side. This paper examines the supply side dynamics of this unprecedented public
      health phenomenon. We provide evidence for several interrelated supply-side
      elements that have contributed to the present public health crisis. We observe
      that initially, persistently high levels of prescription opioid availability and 
      use exposed large proportions of the North American population to opioids,
      resulting in correspondingly high levels of medical and non-medical use (e.g.,
      involving diversion). While various intervention measures to control prescription
      opioid availability and use have been implemented in recent years, leading to
      eventual reductions in opioid dispensing levels, these occurred late in the
      crisis’s evolution. Moreover, these supply reductions have not been met by
      corresponding reductions in opioid use or demand levels. These growing
      discrepancies between opioid demand and prescription-based sources have left
      major gaps in opioid supplies. In response to such supply gaps, highly potent and
      toxic illicit opioid products have rapidly proliferated across North America, and
      become a core driver of the dramatic spikes in opioid overdose fatality levels in
      recent years. These supply-related interrelations are corroborated by a
      corresponding increase in illicit opioid-related fatalities, which arose just as 
      medical opioid supplies began to decrease in many jurisdictions. Improved
      analyses and understanding of the supply-side dynamics of the opioid crisis are
      urgently needed in order to inform future intervention and policy development.
      Meanwhile, the high mortality toll related to illicit, highly toxic opioid
      exposure requires sustained solutions, including supply-oriented measures (e.g., 
      safer opioid distribution for at–risk users) towards improved public health
      protection.

TI  - Can we identify individuals with an ALPL variant in adults with persistent
      hypophosphatasaemia?
LID - 51
AB  - Background: Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inborn error of metabolism characterized
      by low levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Scarce evidence exists about
      features that should signal the potential association between hypophosphatasaemia
      and HPP in adults. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of ALPL
      variants in subjects with persistent hypophosphatasaemia and determine the
      associated clinical and laboratory features. For this cross-sectional study,
      laboratory records of 386,353 subjects were screened by measurement of ALP
      activity. A total of 85 (0.18%) subjects with persistent hypophosphatasaemia (≥2 
      serum alkaline phosphatase–ALP–measurements ≤35 IU/L and none > 45 IU/L) were
      included (secondary causes previously discarded). ALPL genetic testing and a
      systematized questionnaire to retrieve demographic, clinical and laboratory data 
      were performed. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression models were employed
      to identify the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with ALPL
      variants. Results: Forty subjects (47%) had a variant(s) in ALPL. With regard to 
      clinical characteristics, the presence of an ALPL variant was significantly
      associated only with musculoskeletal pain (OR: 7.6; 95% IC: 1.9–30.9).
      Nevertheless, a trend to present more dental abnormalities (OR: 3.6; 95% IC:
      0.9–13.4) was observed. Metatarsal stress fractures were also more frequent (4 vs
      0; p < 0.05) in this group. Regarding laboratory features, median ALP levels were
      lower in subjects with ALPL variants (26 vs 29 IU/L; p < 0.005). Interestingly,
      the threshold of ALP levels < 25 IU/L showed a specificity, positive predictive
      value and positive likelihood ratio of 97.8, 94.4% and 19.8 to detect a positive 
      ALPL test, respectively. Conclusions: In subjects with persistent
      hypophosphatasaemia –secondary causes excluded– one out of two presented ALPL
      variants. Musculoskeletal pain and ALP levels < 25 IU/L are associated with this 
      variant(s). In this scenario, ALP levels < 25 IU/L seem to be very useful to
      identify individuals with the presence of an ALPL variant.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial to investigate the relationship between mild
      hypercapnia and cerebral oxygen saturation in patients undergoing major surgery.
LID - e029159
AB  - Objectives: The effects of hypercapnia on regional cerebral oxygen saturation
      (rSO2) during surgery are unclear. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to 
      investigate the relationship between mild hypercapnia and rSO2. We hypothesised
      that, compared with targeted normocapnia (TN), targeted mild hypercapnia (TMH)
      during major surgery would increase rSO2. Design: A prospective, randomised,
      controlled trial in adult participants undergoing elective major surgery.
      Setting: A single tertiary centre in Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.
      Participants: 40 participants were randomised to either a TMH or TN group (20 to 
      each). Interventions: TMH (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, 
      PaCO2, 45–55 mm Hg) or TN (PaCO2 35–40 mm Hg) was delivered via controlled
      ventilation throughout surgery. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The
      primary endpoint was the absolute difference between the two groups in percentage
      change in rSO2 from baseline to completion of surgery. Secondary endpoints
      included intraoperative pH, bicarbonate concentration, base excess, serum
      potassium concentration, incidence of postoperative delirium and length of stay
      (LOS) in hospital. Results: The absolute difference between the two groups in
      percentage change in rSO2 from the baseline to the completion of surgery was
      19.0% higher in both hemispheres with TMH (p<0.001). On both sides, the
      percentage change in rSO2 was greater in the TMH group than the TN group
      throughout the duration of surgery. The difference between the groups became more
      noticeable over time. Furthermore, postoperative delirium was higher in the TN
      group (risk difference 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5, p=0.02). LOS was similar between
      groups (5 days vs 5 days; p=0.99). Conclusion: TMH was associated with a stable
      increase in rSO2 from the baseline, while TN was associated with a decrease in
      rSO2 in both hemispheres in patients undergoing major surgery. This resulted in a
      clear separation of percentage change in rSO2 from the baseline between TMH and
      TN over time. Our findings provide the rationale for larger studies on TMH during
      surgery. Trial registration number: The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials
      Registry (ACTRN12616000320459).

TI  - Acupuncture therapy for postoperative pain of anorectal diseases: A systematic
      review protocol.
LID - e19112
AB  - Background:: The incidence of anorectal diseases has been increasing year by
      year, and the acupuncture treatment for postoperative pain of anorectal diseases 
      has the excellent therapeutic effect. Currently, there are no relevant articles
      for systematic review. Methods:: We will search the randomized controlled trials 
      related to acupuncture therapy and postoperative anorectal diseases from
      inception to January 2020. The following database is our focus area: PubMed,
      EMBASE, Springer, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane, Controlled Trials Register
      (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), China
      National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan-Fang Database and Chinese
      Scientific Journal Database (VIP database). The primary outcome is the pain of
      visual analogue scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes are the Symptom Checklist,
      Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating (WB) Scale, verbalrating scale (VRS), and 36-Item
      Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scale. We will use Review Manager Software
      (RevMan) V.5.2 for data analysis and quantitative data synthesis. The Cochrane
      collaborative tool will be used to assess the risk of bias in the included
      studies. Results:: Given the available evidence, this study will provide high
      level results for acupuncture therapy in treating postoperative pain of anorectal
      diseases. Conclusion:: The conclusions of this study will provide evidence for
      whether acupuncture is effective in treating postoperative pain of anorectal
      diseases. PROSPERO registration number:: CRD42020150015.

TI  - Ethnopharmacological Applications Targeting Alcohol Abuse: Overview and Outlook.
LID - 1593
AB  - Excessive alcohol consumption is the cause of several diseases and thus is of a
      major concern for society. Worldwide alcohol consumption has increased by many
      folds over the past decades. This urgently calls for intervention and relapse
      counteract measures. Modern pharmacological solutions induce complete alcohol
      self-restraint and prevent relapse, but they have many side effects. Natural
      products are most promising as they cause fewer adverse effects. Here we discuss 
      in detail the medicinal plants used in various traditional/folklore medicine
      systems for targeting alcohol abuse. We also comprehensively describe preclinical
      and clinical studies done on some of these plants along with the possible
      mechanisms of action.

TI  - Are Anticholinergic Medications Associated With Increased Risk of Dementia and
      Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia? A Nationwide 15-Year Follow-Up
      Cohort Study in Taiwan.
LID - 30
AB  - Background/Objective: In previous reports, the usage of anticholinergic
      medications has been associated with an increased risk of dementia with prolonged
      usage or with a high Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB). This study aimed to 
      investigate the association between anticholinergic medications and the risk of
      dementia using data from Taiwan's National Health Research Database (NHIRD).
      Methods: A total of 790,240 patients, with 197,560 patients receiving
      anticholinergic medications and 592,680 control patients (1:3) matched for sex,
      age, and index-year, were enrolled from the two million Longitudinal Health
      Insurance Dataset, a subdataset of the NHIRD, between 2000 and 2015. The
      time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to explore the hazard ratio (HR) 
      with a 95% confidence interval for the association between anticholinergics and
      the risk of dementia during the 15-year follow-up. The behavioral and
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) were recognized by the usage of
      psychotropics. The ACB ranged from zero to three, divided as score <1, 1–1.9,
      2–2.9, 3–4.9,and ≧5. The sensitivity analysis was done by excluding the diagnoses
      of dementia in the first 2 or 4 years after anticholinergic usage. Results: In
      the anticholinergic usage cohort, the HR was 1.043 (95% CI = 0.958-1.212, p =
      0.139) without a significant difference. The sensitivity analysis revealed no
      association between the usage of anticholinergics and the risk of dementia.
      Anticholinergic usage was not associated with BPSD. Male sex, patients of ages of
      60–64 and ≧80, usage of antiparkinsonian medications, a history of Parkinson's
      disease, epilepsy, urinary incontinence, depression, bipolar disorder, and
      psychotic disorder were independent risk factors of dementia. Increased HRs for
      dementia were associated with an ACB ≥ 5 and an anticholinergic usage period ≥
      1,460 days. Conclusion: In this study, the usage of anticholinergics was not
      associated with the risk of dementia or BPSD in a 15-year follow-up study.
      However, patients with the male sex, patients with ages of 65–79 and ≧80,
      patients with some comorbidities, high ACB scores, and long anticholinergic
      treatment duration were associated with the risk of dementia.

TI  - A Review of Scientific Evidence for THC:CBD Oromucosal Spray (Nabiximols) in the 
      Management of Chronic Pain.
PG  - 399-410
AB  - The 20% prevalence of chronic pain in the general population is a major health
      concern given the often profound associated impairment of daily activities,
      employment status, and health-related quality of life in sufferers. Resource
      utilization associated with chronic pain represents an enormous burden for
      healthcare systems. Although analgesia based on the World Health Organization’s
      pain ladder continues to be the mainstay of chronic pain management, aside from
      chronic cancer pain or end-of-life care, prolonged use of non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids to manage chronic pain is rarely sustainable. 
      As the endocannabinoid system is known to control pain at peripheral, spinal, and
      supraspinal levels, interest in medical use of cannabis is growing. A proprietary
      blend of cannabis plant extracts containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
      and cannabidiol (CBD) as the principal cannabinoids is formulated as an
      oromucosal spray (USAN name: nabiximols) and standardized to ensure quality,
      consistency and stability. This review examines evidence for THC:CBD oromucosal
      spray (nabiximols) in the management of chronic pain conditions. Cumulative
      evidence from clinical trials and an exploratory analysis of the German Pain
      e-Registry suggests that add-on THC:CBD oromucosal spray (nabiximols) may have a 
      role in managing chronic neuropathic pain, although further precise clinical
      trials are required to draw definitive conclusions.

TI  - MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA IN A CHILD AFTER MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING: A CASE
      REPORT.
LID - e2018267
AB  - Objective:: To report on a case of malignant hyperthermia in a child after a
      magnetic resonance imaging of the skull was performed using sevoflurane
      anesthesia. Case description:: A 3-year-old boy admitted to the pediatric
      intensive care unit after presenting clinical and laboratory findings consistent 
      with unspecified viral meningoencephalitis. While the patient was sedated, a
      magnetic resonance imaging of the skul was performed using propofol followed by
      the administration of sevoflurane through a laryngeal mask in order to continue
      anesthesia. Approximately three hours after the start of the procedure, the
      patient presented persistent tachycardia, tachypnea, generalized muscular
      stiffness and hyperthermia. With a diagnostic hypothesis of malignant
      hyperthermia, dantrolene was then administered, which immediately induced muscle 
      stiffness, tachycardia, tachypnea and reduced body temperature. Comments::
      Malignant hyperthermia is a rare pharmacogenetic syndrome characterized by a
      severe hypermetabolic reaction after the administration of halogenated
      inhalational anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants such as
      succinylcholine, or both. Although it is a potentially fatal disease, the rapid
      administration of continued doses dantrolene has drastically reduced the
      morbidity and mortality of the disease.

LID - 434
AB  - (1) Background: Oncological gastrectomy requires complex multidisciplinary

      evidence related to their use in managing oncological gastrectomy is limited.
      This study evaluated the effect of a CP for oncological gastrectomy on process
      and outcome quality. (2) Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing oncological
      gastrectomy before (n = 64) or after (n = 62) the introduction of a CP were
      evaluated. Assessed parameters included catheter and drain management,
      postoperative mobilization, resumption of diet and length of stay. Morbidity,
      mortality, reoperation and readmission rates were used as indicators of outcome
      quality. (3) Results: Enteral nutrition was initiated significantly earlier after
      CP implementation (5.0 vs. 7.0 days, p < 0.0001). Readmission was more frequent
      before CP implementation (7.8% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.05). Incentive spirometer usage
      increased following CP implementation (100% vs. 90.6%, p = 0.11). Mortality,
      morbidity and reoperation rates remained unchanged. (4) Conclusions: After
      implementation of an oncological gastrectomy CP, process quality improved, while 
      indicators of outcome quality such as mortality and reoperation rates remained
      unchanged. CPs are a promising tool to standardize perioperative care for
      oncological gastrectomy.

TI  - Family Planning Practices in Appalachia: Focus Group Perspectives on Service
      Needs in the Context of Regional Substance Abuse.
LID - 1198
AB  - Reproductive health disparities in the Appalachian region may be driven by
      barriers to healthcare access. However, the barriers specific to accessing family
      planning services in Appalachia have not yet been identified from the
      perspectives of Appalachian community members. Moreover, it is unclear how
      community members might perceive elevated levels of opioid use in the region to
      impact family planning practices. To fill this gap in knowledge, the current
      qualitative study explored community perspectives about family planning in
      Appalachia in the context of the opioid epidemic for the purpose of developing a 
      survey instrument based on these responses. We conducted three video call focus
      group interviews with community stakeholders, those who live, work and are
      invested in Appalachia (N = 16), and analyzed the responses using Levesque,
      Harris, and Russell’s (2013) five pillars of healthcare access as a framework to 
      categorize family planning practices and perceptions of service needs in the
      context of regional substance abuse: (1) approachability, (2) acceptability, (3) 
      availability and accommodation, (4) affordability, and (5) appropriateness.
      Subthemes within each of these five categories were also identified. Our findings
      highlight stakeholder concerns around a lack of knowledge about and access to
      family planning services in Appalachia. Community members also expressed concern 
      around the lack of availability of substance use treatment services, which may
      negatively impact family planning use and access in the region.

TI  - Quo Vadis PCA? A Review on Current Concepts, Economic Considerations,
      Patient-Related Aspects, and Future Development with respect to
      Patient-Controlled Analgesia.
LID - 9201967
AB  - This review assesses four interrelating aspects of patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA), a long-standing and still widely used concept for postoperative pain
      management. Over the years, anaesthesiologists and patients have appreciated the 
      benefits of PCA alike. The market has seen new technologies leveraging
      noninvasive routes of administration and, thus, further increasing patient and
      staff satisfaction as well as promoting safety aspects. Pharmaceutical research
      focuses on the reduction or avoidance of opioids, side effects, and adverse
      events although influence of these aspects appears to be minor. The importance of
      education is still eminent, and new educational formats are tested to train
      healthcare professionals and patients likewise. New PCA technology can support
      the implementation of efficient processes to reduce workload and human errors;
      however, these new products come with a cost, which is not necessarily reflected 
      through beneficial budget impact or significant improvements in patient outcome. 
      Although first steps have been taken to better recognize the importance of
      postoperative pain management through the introduction of value-based
      reimbursement, in most western countries, PCA is not specifically compensated.
      PCA is still an effective and valued technique for postoperative pain management.
      Although there is identifiable potential for future developments in various
      aspects, this potential has not materialized in new products.

TI  - Integrative East–West Medicine Intervention for Chronic Daily Headache: A Case
      Report and Care Perspective.
LID - 2164956120905817
AB  - Chronic daily headache is a group of headache syndromes including most commonly
      chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache, which often overlap, are
      complicated by medication overuse and are disabling, costly, and variable
      responsive to western pharmacotherapeutic interventions. There is growing
      research and awareness of integrative health approaches and therapies to address 
      patients with chronic headache, yet limited examples of how to deliver this
      approach. This article reviews a commonly seen challenging case of a patient with
      overlapping chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache complicated by
      medication overuse managed with an integrative east–west medicine intervention.
      This included person-centered biopsychosocial history taking, traditional Chinese
      medicine informed acupuncture, trigger point injections, and contributing factors
      modifications. A narrative review of the literature is presented to demonstrate
      an evidence-informed rationale for incorporating nonpharmacologic approaches to
      effectively help reduce the symptom burden of this patient population.

TI  - The Complex Balance between Analgesic Efficacy, Change of Dose and Safety Profile
      Over Time, in Cancer Patients Treated with Opioids: Providing the Clinicians with
      an Evaluation Tool.
LID - 502
AB  - Background: Scanty data exist on the integration between the analgesic effect of 
      opioids, dose changes, and adverse events in cancer patients. Methods: To provide
      further information on this issue, we analysed data on 498 advanced-stage cancer 
      patients treated with strong opioids. At baseline and three visits (at days 7,
      14, and 21), pain intensity, oral morphine-equivalent daily dose, and the
      prevalence of major adverse events were measured. The proportion of responders
      (pain intensity decrease ≥30% from baseline) and non-responders, as well as of
      patients with low or high dose escalation, was calculated. Results: Pain
      intensity strongly decreased from baseline (pain intensity difference −4.0 at day
      7 and −4.2 at day 21) in responders, while it was quite stable in non-responders 
      (pain intensity difference −0.8 at day 7 and −0.9 at day 21). In low dose
      escalation patients (82.4% at final visit), daily dose changed from 52.3 to 65.3 
      mg; in high dose escalation patients (17.6%), it varied from 94.1 to 146.7 mg.
      Among responders, high dose escalation patients experienced significantly more
      frequent adverse events compared to low or high dose escalation patients, while
      no differences were observed in non-responders. Conclusions: The response to
      opioids results from the combination of three clinical aspects, which are
      strongly interrelated. These results provide some thoughts to help clinical
      evaluations and therapeutic decisions regarding opioid use.

TI  - Bench to Bedside: Animal Models of Radiation Induced Musculoskeletal Toxicity.
LID - 427
AB  - Ionizing radiation is a critical aspect of current cancer therapy. While
      classically mature bone was thought to be relatively radio-resistant, more recent
      data have shown this to not be the case. Radiation therapy (RT)-induced bone loss
      leading to fracture is a source of substantial morbidity. The mechanisms of RT
      likely involve multiple pathways, including changes in angiogenesis and bone
      vasculature, osteoblast damage/suppression, and increased osteoclast activity.
      The majority of bone loss appears to occur rapidly after exposure to ionizing RT,
      with significant changes in cortical thickness being detectable on computed
      tomography (CT) within three to four months. Additionally, there is a
      dose–response relationship. Cortical thinning is especially notable in areas of
      bone that receive >40 gray (Gy). Methods to mitigate toxicity due to RT-induced
      bone loss is an area of active investigation. There is an accruing clinical trial
      investigating the use of risderonate, a bisphosphonate, to prevent rib bone loss 
      in patients undergoing lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
      Additionally, several other promising therapeutic/preventative approaches are
      being explored in preclinical studies, including parathyroid hormone (PTH),
      amifostine, and mechanical loading of irradiated bones.

      Post-Surgical Pain After Thoracoscopic Surgeries: A Randomized Controlled,
      Factorial Design, International, Multicenter Pilot Trial.
PG  - 377-87
AB  - Purpose: We conducted a feasibility 2×2 factorial trial comparing
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists (intravenous ketamine and oral memantine)
      versus placebo and intravenous steroids versus placebo, in patients having
      elective video-assisted thoracic surgery lobectomies, at St. Joseph’s Hamilton,
      Canada, and Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA. Our feasibility objectives were: 1)
      recruitment rate/week; 2) recruitment of ≥90% of eligible patients; and 3) >90%
      follow-up. Secondary objectives were incidence and intensity of persistent
      post-surgical pain (PPSP) and other clinical and safety outcomes. Methods: Using 
      computerized randomization, patients were allocated to one of four groups: NMDA
      active with steroid placebo; NMDA placebo with steroid active; both NMDA and
      steroid active; both NMDA and steroid placebo. Patients, health providers, and
      data analysts were blinded to allocation. Patients were followed for 3 months
      after randomization. Results: The trial was initiated in May 2017 at Hamilton
      and, after subsequent regulatory and ethics approval, in April 2018 at Cleveland.
      The trial had to be stopped after only 1 month of recruitment in Cleveland
      because the packaged study medications (memantine) expired and we were unable to 
      procure the dosage required. Among 41 eligible patients, 27 (66%) were
      randomized. The recruitment rate/week was 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI):
      0.47–0.79 in Hamilton; and 1, 95% CI: 0.83–1.17 in Cleveland. Follow-up was
      complete for all 24 patients (100%) in Hamilton, and 3 of 4 patients in
      Cleveland. In total, only 4 patients (15%), and 2 patients (7%) had persistent
      pain at rest and with movement, respectively. There were no significant
      differences between groups for other outcomes. Conclusion: The trial had to be
      stopped prematurely due to non-availability of study medications. Trial
      feasibility objectives of recruiting 90% of eligible patients and recruiting at
      least one patient/week per site were not met. Consideration for protocol changes 
      will be necessary for the full trial. Trial Registration: NCT02950233.

TI  - Angiotensin II blockade had no effect on range of motion after total knee
      arthroplasty: a retrospective review.
LID - 48
AB  - Background: Stiffness and pain from arthrofibrosis following total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) is a challenging problem, and investigating methods to prevent
      or reduce the incidence of postoperative arthrofibrosis is critical. Studies have
      shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin
      receptor blockers (ARBs) are efficacious at preventing fibrotic disorders in the 
      lungs, liver, kidneys, and eyes. Our aim was to determine if ACEI or ARB use
      postoperatively reduces the incidence of arthrofibrosis in TKA patients. Methods:
      In a retrospective review, we analyzed 141 consecutive TKAs performed at a single
      institution by a single surgeon from December 2010 to December 2014. Range of
      motion (ROM) in patients already taking ACEI, ARB, or neither medication was
      compared. Independent variables recorded were gender, age, BMI, presence of
      diabetes or preoperative opioid or statin use, preoperative ROM, and use of ACEIs
      or ARBs. Dependent variables recorded were postoperative knee flexion, extension,
      and total arc of motion. The primary outcome variable was success or failure of
      achieving 118o total arc of motion postoperatively, based on a study that found
      significant compromise of function in TKA patients who failed to obtain this
      goal. Secondary endpoints were postoperative knee flexion, extension, and total
      arc of motion. Results: The use of neither ACEIs nor ARBs showed a significant
      difference in attaining greater than 118° of motion postoperatively compared to
      controls at 6 months. Significant predictors of obtaining > 118° motion were BMI 
      (p < 0.05), preoperative flexion (p < 0.001), and preoperative total arc of
      motion (p < 0.002). Significant predictors of secondary ROM outcomes were
      preoperative ROM and BMI. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the principle 
      predictor of postoperative ROM is BMI and preoperative ROM. The use of ACEIs or
      ARBs did not result in a greater likelihood of obtaining satisfactory ROM
      postoperatively.

TI  - Effects of sevoflurane and desflurane on the nociceptive responses of substantia 
      gelatinosa neurons in the rat spinal cord dorsal horn: An in vivo patch-clamp
      analysis.
LID - 1744806920903149
AB  - Background: Volatile anesthetics suppress noxiously evoked activity in the spinal
      dorsal horn, which could contribute in part to analgesia, immobility. Modulation 
      of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in substantia gelatinosa
      neurons could lead to the suppression of dorsal horn activity; however, this
      phenomenon has not yet been investigated fully. Methods: In urethane-anesthetized
      rats, extracellular activity of dorsal horn neurons (action potentials) and
      excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents in substantia gelatinosa neurons were
      recorded using extracellular and in vivo patch-clamp techniques, respectively, to
      assess the spontaneous and the noxious-evoked activity. Sevoflurane or desflurane
      at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 minimum alveolar concentration was
      administered by inhalation. Hot- and cold-plate tests were performed to assess
      nociceptive responses during the inhalation of volatile anesthetics at lower
      anesthetic doses (0.1–0.5 minimum alveolar concentration). Results: At anesthetic
      doses (1 and 2 minimum alveolar concentration), both sevoflurane and desflurane
      decreased the frequency of action potentials in the dorsal horn and the
      activities of excitatory postsynaptic currents in substantia gelatinosa neurons
      during pinch stimulation and decreased the activities of spontaneous and
      miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Inhibition of the frequencies was
      more prominent than that of amplitudes in spontaneous and miniature excitatory
      postsynaptic currents at these anesthetic doses. However, at subanesthetic doses 
      (0.1 and 0.2 minimum alveolar concentration), desflurane facilitated action
      potentials and excitatory postsynaptic currents. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents
      were inhibited by both anesthetics at anesthetic doses (1 and 2 minimum alveolar 
      concentration). Hot- or cold-plate tests showed hyperalgesic effects of
      desflurane at subanesthetic doses (0.1 and 0.2 minimum alveolar concentration)
      and a dose-dependent analgesic effect of sevoflurane. Conclusions: Sevoflurane
      and desflurane at anesthetic doses suppressed dorsal horn activity mainly via
      inhibition of excitatory postsynaptic currents in substantia gelatinosa neurons, 
      which would contribute to their analgesic properties. Presynaptic mechanisms were
      likely in excitatory postsynaptic currents inhibition. Desflurane but not
      sevoflurane may have a hyperalgesic effect at subanesthetic doses.

LID - 2050313X20907015
AB  - Opioid medication–related deaths have increased to epidemic proportions in the
      last decade. This report describes a case of 43-year-old female with a traumatic 
      brain injury who developed chronic pain and opioid dependence. The patient
      expressed concerns and wanted weaning off opioids. Recent legalization of medical
      marijuana in Pennsylvania allows us to try it as an alternative to opioids for
      chronic pain. Medical cannibus has risks associated with administration but is
      safer than opioids. Our patient was successfully weaned off her opioid
      medications with the help of medical cannibus and pain remained well controlled. 
      More studies need to be done on using medical cannibus as an alternative to
      opioids.

TI  - Chronic Non-cancer Pain Management and Addiction: A Review.
LID - e6963
AB  - The use of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) has been a fast-rising
      treatment phenomenon in the last two decades. Though opioids are advocated in
      various chronic pain management guidelines, their use in chronic non-cancer pain 
      still remains controversial as evidence of this approach is still weak. This
      paper highlights potential adverse effects associated with opioid use in pain
      management, including an increase in tolerance, dependence, and addiction
      outcomes. Nonetheless, opioids have an important place in contemporary CNCP
      management for selected patients. However, pain management must involve regular
      monitoring and the use of a multimodal pain management strategy. It is essential 
      that the treating physician must be up-to-date with the form of therapy so that
      they have the requisite confidence to prescribe opioids and effectively manage
      adverse effects. Moreover, the adverse effects should be treated promptly to
      enhance patient compliance. Since this approach is beneficial for some patients, 
      opioid treatment should only be applied on a case by case basis.

TI  - Prescription drug diversion, misuse, and abuse among people living with HIV: a
      scoping review protocol.
LID - 29
AB  - Background: Prescription drugs are controlled medicines due to their potential
      risks of being diverted, misused, and abused. Since the introduction of
      antiretroviral (ARVs) drugs, HIV is currently regarded as a chronic condition.
      However, prescription drug diversion, misuse, and abuse might serve as one of the
      critical barriers for achieving optimal medication adherence among people living 
      with HIV, thereby negatively impacting the HIV care mandate. The primary aim of
      this scoping review is to gather evidence on the prevalence, practices, risk
      factors, and motives associated with prescription drug diversion, misuse, and
      abuse, as well as the evidence on the association between prescription drug
      diversion, misuse, and abuse with antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence.
      Methods: This review will be guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s framework as well as
      recommendations by Levac et al. (Implement Sci 5:69, 2010). We will search the
      following databases for relevant literature meeting our eligibility criteria:
      PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCOhost (Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, and
      Newspaper Source), World Health Organization, Science Direct, and Open Access
      Theses and Dissertations. Studies published within the period of January 1996 to 
      June 2019 are eligible. The included studies should report evidence on the
      prevalence, practices, risk factors, motives, or association between ART
      adherence and prescription drug diversion, misuse, and abuse. Thematic analysis
      will be applied to summarize the review findings. Discussion: We anticipate
      finding a considerable number of research studies on prescription drug diversion,
      misuse, and abuse among people living with HIV. Our synthesis of this evidence
      base is intended to serve as guidance for future research studies. The study
      findings will be disseminated through the traditional academic platforms, such as
      peer-reviewed publications and presentations at relevant local and international 
      conferences, symposiums, and seminars. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO

TI  - Prospects for finding the mechanisms of sex differences in addiction with human
      and model organism genetic analysis.
LID - e12645
AB  - Despite substantial evidence for sex differences in addiction epidemiology,
      addiction‐relevant behaviors and associated neurobiological phenomena, the
      mechanisms and implications of these differences remain unknown. Genetic analysis
      in model organism is a potentially powerful and effective means of discovering
      the mechanisms that underlie sex differences in addiction. Human genetic studies 
      are beginning to show precise risk variants that influence the mechanisms of
      addiction but typically lack sufficient power or neurobiological mechanistic
      access, particularly for the discovery of the mechanisms that underlie sex
      differences. Our thesis in this review is that genetic variation in model
      organisms are a promising approach that can complement these investigations to
      show the biological mechanisms that underlie sex differences in addiction.

TI  - Current and Emerging Pharmacotherapy for Fibromyalgia.
LID - 6541798
AB  - Introduction. Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a pain disorder with an estimated
      prevalence of 1–5%. It is associated with a variety of somatic and psychological 
      disorders. Its exact pathogenesis is still unclear but is involved with neural
      oversensitization and decreased conditioned pain modulation (CPM), combined with 
      cognitive dysfunction, memory impairment, and altered information processing.
      Connectivity between brain areas involved in pain processing, alertness, and
      cognition is increased in the syndrome, making its pharmacologic therapy complex.
      Only three drugs, pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran are currently
      FDA-approved for FM treatment, but many other agents have been tested over the
      years, with varying efficacy. Areas Covered. The purpose of this review is to
      summarize current clinical experience with different pharmacologic treatments
      used for fibromyalgia and introduce future perspectives in developing therapies. 
      Expert Opinion. Future insights into the fields of cannabinoid and opioid
      research, as well as an integrative approach towards the incorporation of
      genetics and functional imaging combined with additional fields of research
      relevant towards the study of complex CNS disorders, are likely to lead to new
      developments of novel tailor-made treatments for FMS patients.

TI  - Pregabalin Abuse in Combination With Other Drugs: Monitoring Among Methadone
      Patients.
LID - 1022
AB  - Introduction: In recent years, there has been an increase in the non-medical use 
      of psychoactive prescription drugs including pregabalin (PGB). Studies have shown
      that multiple drug users and patients in methadone treatment programs
      administered PGB at high dosages in order to achieve euphoria, reduce withdrawal 
      symptoms, or potentiate the effects of methadone. For these reasons, accurate
      toxicological monitoring is required for these high-risk individuals. Materials
      and Methods: The present study investigated whether PGB could be detected in the 
      hair samples of 250 patients with a history of opiate dependency, and under
      toxicological surveillance assess their compliance with methadone maintenance
      therapy. Results: Opiates were found in 54/250 of all hair samples, while
      cannabis was present in 74/250 patients, cocaine was detected in 21/250 patients,
      and benzodiazepines without prescription were identified in 49/250 patients. As
      expected, methadone was present in all 250 patients (100%). PGB without
      prescription was found in the hair samples of 35/250 patients (14%). Of these,
      91.43% were male, 48.57% were <30 y old, and 45.71% were between ages 30 and 50
      y. There were no apparent associations among PGB use, daily methadone dosage, and
      duration of methadone maintenance therapy. Psychiatric comorbidities were present
      in 25.71% of the patients abusing PGB. Anxiety (55.56%) and depression (33.33%)
      were the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. Discussion: Most of the patients
      taking PGB (57.14%) used other drugs (especially opiates) concurrently. The
      utility of hair analysis is explained by easy and rapid sample collection and the
      ability of the hair to reflect long-term drug use and incorporate drug
      metabolites. The findings of this study suggested that PGB has significant
      potential for abuse by high-risk populations such as opioid users and patients
      with dual diagnosis. These risks are particularly high in cases of poly-drug use 
      and drug intake that are not in compliance with prescription guidelines.

TI  - The Efficacy and Safety of Paravertebral Block Combined with Parecoxib During
      Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 355-66
AB  - Background: Although video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is increasingly 
      used, the optimal analgesia strategy is still unknown. We explore the efficacy
      and safety of preemptive ultrasound-guided paravertebral block (PVB) combined
      with parecoxib during VATS. Methods: Seventy-four patients were divided into two 
      groups. PVBs were performed before anesthesia induction under real-time
      ultrasound guidance. Visual analog scale (VAS) score with coughing at 48 h after 
      surgery, postoperative sufentanil consumption and level of sedation (LOS) at 1,
      4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively, intraoperative hemodynamics, satisfaction
      scores of patients and surgeons, remedial measures, time to chest tube removed
      and mobilization, adverse effects and hospital stay length were recorded. We also
      recorded inflammatory markers, respiratory function and the prevalence of chronic
      pain after surgery. Results: VAS scores at rest and with coughing during the
      first 24 h after surgery were significantly lower in the P group (P<0.05).
      Consumption of sevoﬂurane, remifentanil, and dexmedetomidine was all
      significantly reduced in the P group (P<0.05). The consumption of sufentanil
      within 48 h after surgery, time to first dose and total dose of rescue ketorolac 
      was significantly lower in the P group (P<0.05). The FEV1/FVC ratio was
      significantly higher in the P group at 1 and 3 d after surgery (P<0.05). Times to
      chest tube removal and mobilization were significantly shorter in the P group
      (P<0.05). Compared with the C group, the level of both ACTH and cortisol was
      significantly reduced in the P group at 1 and 3 d after surgery (P<0.05).
      Conclusion: PVB combined with parecoxib was associated with better pain relief,
      decreased sufentanil and ketorolac consumption, less hemodynamic instability, and
      a lower surgery-related stress response. However, the incidences of chronic pain 
      3 and 6 months after surgery and the risk of complication except urinary
      retention were not significantly different between groups.

TI  - Protocol for a multi-centre, definitive randomised controlled trial of the
      effectiveness of Individual Placement and Support for employment support among
      people with alcohol and drug dependence.
LID - 167
AB  - Background: Unemployment is highly prevalent in populations with alcohol and drug
      dependence and the employment support offered in addiction-treatment programmes
      is ineffective. Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based
      intervention for competitive employment. IPS has been extensively studied in
      severe mental illness and physical disabilities, but there have been no formal
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in alcohol and drug dependence. The
      Individual Placement and Support for Alcohol and Drug Dependence (IPS-AD) study
      should determine whether IPS for patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), opioid
      use disorder (OUD) and other drug use disorder is effective. Design/methods: The 
      IPS-AD study is a seven-site, pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, superiority
      RCT. IPS-AD includes a realist process evaluation. Eligible patients (adult,
      unemployed or economically inactive for at least 6 months and wishing to obtain
      open job market employment and enrolled in ongoing community treatment-as-usual
      (TAU; the control condition) in England for AUD, OUD and other drug use
      disorders) will be randomised (1:1) to receive TAU and any standard employment
      support, or TAU plus IPS (the experimental condition) for 9 months with up to 4
      months of in-work support. The primary outcome measure will be competitive
      employment status (at least 1 day (7 h)) during an 18-month follow-up, determined
      by patient-level, trial-data-linkage with national tax and state benefit
      databases. From meta-analysis, an 18% target difference on this measure of
      vocational effectiveness (for the experimental intervention) and a two-sided 5%
      level of statistical significance, will require a minimum target sample of 832
      participants to achieve 90% power for a pre-registered, mixed-effects,
      multi-variable logistic regression model. A maximum-likelihood
      multiple-imputation approach will manage missing outcome data. IPS-AD has six
      vocational secondary outcome measures during the 18-month follow-up: (1) total
      time in competitive employment (and corresponding National Insurance
      contributions and tax paid); (2) time from randomisation to first competitive
      employment; (3) number of competitive job appointments; (4) job tenure (length of
      longest held competitive employment); (5) sustained employment (tenure in a
      single appointment for at least 13 weeks); and (6) job search self-efficacy. A
      primary cost-benefit analysis and a secondary cost-effectiveness analysis will be
      done using the primary outcome and secondary vocational outcomes, respectively
      and will include addiction treatment and social and health outcomes and their
      associated reference costs. The process evaluation will address IPS
      implementation and delivery. Discussion: The IPS-AD study is the first
      large-scale, multi-site, definitive, superiority RCT of IPS for people with
      alcohol and drug dependence. Findings from the study will have substantial
      implications for service delivery. Trial registration: ISRCTN Registry, ID:

TI  - Electroacupuncture for postoperative pain after nasal endoscopic surgery: study
      protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
LID - 163
AB  - Background: Postoperative pain is common after nasal endoscopic surgery. It
      interferes with the quality of sleep and delays postoperative recovery.
      Acupuncture is an effective tool for pain management. However, electroacupuncture
      specifically for the relief of postoperative pain after nasal endoscopic surgery 
      has not yet been studied in a randomized controlled trial. Methods/design: This
      randomized sham-controlled patient- and assessor-blind pilot trial has been
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in managing
      postoperative pain following nasal endoscopic surgery to treat sinusitis due to
      nasal polyps. Altogether, 30 participants will be randomly allocated to an
      electroacupuncture or non-invasive sham control in a 1:1 ratio. Treatment will
      occur within 2 h before the operation, immediately after the operation upon
      arrival in the recovery ward, and once daily for 3 days. The primary outcome is
      the pain numerical rating scale, which will be analyzed using the area under the 
      curve. The secondary outcome measures include heart rate and blood pressure after
      the operation, sleep quality during the hospital stay (actigraph), quality of
      recovery, and the 36-item short form health survey. This trial will use an
      intention-to-treat analysis. Discussion: This pilot randomized controlled trial
      will explore the feasibility of the further clinical application of
      electroacupuncture for the management of postoperative pain. It will inform the
      design of a further full-scale trial. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial

TI  - Complementary roles of murine NaV1.7, NaV1.8 and NaV1.9 in acute itch signalling.
LID - 2326
AB  - Acute pruritus occurs in various disorders. Despite severe repercussions on
      quality of life treatment options remain limited. Voltage-gated sodium channels
      (NaV) are indispensable for transformation and propagation of sensory signals
      implicating them as drug targets. Here, NaV1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 were compared for
      their contribution to itch by analysing NaV-specific knockout mice. Acute
      pruritus was induced by a comprehensive panel of pruritogens (C48/80, endothelin,
      5-HT, chloroquine, histamine, lysophosphatidic acid, trypsin, SLIGRL, β-alanine, 
      BAM8-22), and scratching was assessed using a magnet-based recording technology. 
      We report an unexpected stimulus-dependent diversity in NaV channel-mediated itch
      signalling. NaV1.7−/− showed substantial scratch reduction mainly towards strong 
      pruritogens. NaV1.8−/− impaired histamine and 5-HT-induced scratching while
      NaV1.9 was involved in itch signalling towards 5-HT, C48/80 and SLIGRL.
      Furthermore, similar microfluorimetric calcium responses of sensory neurons and
      expression of itch-related TRP channels suggest no change in sensory transduction
      but in action potential transformation and conduction. The cumulative sum of
      scratching over all pruritogens confirmed a leading role of NaV1.7 and indicated 
      an overall contribution of NaV1.9. Beside the proposed general role of NaV1.7 and
      1.9 in itch signalling, scrutiny of time courses suggested NaV1.8 to sustain
      prolonged itching. Therefore, NaV1.7 and 1.9 may represent targets in pruritus
      therapy.

TI  - Epidural Fibrin Sealant Injection for the Management of Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak 
      Following Dural Puncture in Children.
LID - e6940
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, intracranial hypotension, and postdural puncture 
      headaches are common following dural punctures. Management usually consists of
      conservative treatments with medications (e.g. caffeine, nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, opioids), increased fluid intake, and bed
      rest. In more severe and persistent cases, epidural blood patches (EBPs) are
      indicated. When multiple EBPs fail, epidural injection of fibrin sealant has been
      successful in a few reported adult cases. The authors describe the first reported
      clinical experiences of epidural fibrin patch in children for repair of CSF leak 
      and resolution of intracranial hypotension. This technique was used in three
      cases where serial EBPs failed to resolve symptoms related to intracranial
      hypotension following dural puncture. Following the procedure, each patient had
      resolution of their presenting clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities, 
      and there were no noted complications. Epidural fibrin sealant injection is a
      reasonable option for relieving intracranial hypotension due to CSF leak
      following dural puncture in children.

TI  - Retrospective Data Analysis and Literature Review for a Development of Enhanced
      Recovery after Surgery Pathway for Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion.
LID - e6930
AB  - ObjectiveWhile enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are associated
      with shorter length of stay and improved outcomes in multiple surgical
      specialties, its application to spine surgery has been limited. Anterior cervical
      discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a common spinal procedure with a relative
      efficacy and safety profile that makes it suitable for the application of ERAS
      principles. Reviewing our outcomes and practice and incorporating evidence-based 
      clinical studies, we propose the development of an ERAS pathway for
      ACDF.MethodsThis is a retrospective review of ACDF cases performed at a single
      institution by a single surgeon from 2014 to 2017. Primary outcome measures
      included length of stay, complications, and 30-day readmission rates. The 1- and 
      2-level and the 3- and 4-level groups were also each consolidated into a single
      cohort for comparison. A comprehensive review of evidence-based literature
      pertaining to ACDF was then performed. Best-practice recommendations derived from
      the literature were incorporated into the proposed ERAS protocol.ResultsIn this
      series of 75 1-level, 77 2-level, 44 3-level and 20 4-level ACDF procedures, the 
      average surgical time (minutes) was 68, 90, 118 and 141; length of stay (days)
      was 1, 1, 1.4, and 1.7; drain usage (%) was 1.3, 2.6, 13.6 and 10; and 30-day
      readmission rates (%) were 2.7, 3.9, 4.5, and 15, respectively. Combining the 1- 
      and 2-level as a single group and 3- and 4-level as another cohort, the 3- and
      4-level cohort had a significantly higher rate of drain usage and estimated blood
      loss (EBL) but there was not a difference in length-of-stay, complications or
      30-day readmission rates.ConclusionsGiven the relative equivalent safety profile 
      between 1- and 2-level as compared to 3- and 4-level ACDF, the proposed ERAS
      pathway can be applied to all patients, and not just restricted to 1-level or
      2-level ACDF. Taking into account feasibility parameters as deduced from a review
      of institutional outcomes, this pathway can streamline same-day discharge and
      improve the patient experience. Its success will be predicated on an iterative
      improvement process deriving from optimal prospective outcome measurements.

TI  - Non-interventional study evaluating exposure to inhaled, low-dose methoxyflurane 
      experienced by hospital emergency department personnel in France.
LID - e034647
AB  - Objectives: Low-dose methoxyflurane is a non-opioid, inhaled analgesic
      administered via the Penthrox inhaler and was recently licensed in Europe for
      emergency relief of moderate-to-severe trauma-associated pain in conscious
      adults. This non-interventional study investigated occupational exposure to
      methoxyflurane in the hospital emergency department (ED) personnel during routine
      clinical practice. Setting and participants: The study was conducted in two
      hospital ED triage rooms in France over a 2-week and 3-week period, respectively.
      Low-dose methoxyflurane analgesia was self-administered by patients via the
      inhaler under the supervision of nursing staff, per routine clinical practice. An
      organic vapour personal badge sampler was attached to the uniform of the nurses
      working in the treatment rooms throughout an 8-hour shift (total of 140 shifts
      during the study period). Seven-day ambient air monitoring of each treatment room
      was also performed. Methoxyflurane levels adsorbed in each badge sampler were
      measured by a central laboratory. The primary objective was to evaluate
      methoxyflurane exposure experience by the hospital ED nurses during an 8-hour
      shift. Results: In 138 badge samplers, the median (range) concentration of
      methoxyflurane present following 8-hour nursing shifts was 0.017 (0.008, 0.736)
      ppm. This level was almost 900-fold lower than the previously reported
      8-hour-derived maximal exposure level of 15 ppm; methoxyflurane exposure
      approaching this threshold was not documented in any badges. There was no
      correlation between the number of applications of low-dose methoxyflurane
      administered during a shift (range 0–5) and the vapour exposure measured on the
      personal badge samplers. Conclusions: This study indicates that nurses working in
      hospital EDs experience very low levels of occupational exposure to
      methoxyflurane vapour during routine clinical practice. These real-world data can
      provide reassurance to healthcare providers supervising patients receiving
      low-dose methoxyflurane analgesia via a Penthrox inhaler; further studies may
      inform exposure in other hospital ED settings.

TI  - Postoperative Pain Management in Emergency Surgeries: A One-year Survey on
      Perception and Satisfaction among Surgical Patients.
PG  - 42-7
AB  - Background:: Postoperative pain varies from an individual to individual. It also 
      varies with types and extent of surgery. In general, postoperative pain is
      inadequately managed in most centers worldwide, especially in developing
      countries. Therefore, this study presents the perception and satisfaction of
      postoperative pain management in emergency surgeries. Methods:: A 1-year
      prospective study of the 891 patients who underwent emergency general surgeries
      at Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, from January to December 2018 is
      hereby presented. Pain scores and patient's satisfaction toward postoperative
      pain management were considered at 8 and 24 h postoperatively through a
      predesigned questionnaire. Numeric Pain Rating Scale was used to determine pain
      intensity and the level of satisfaction following postoperative pain management. 
      Student's t-test was used to compare the pain scores and patient's level of
      satisfaction of the postoperative pain management. Results:: A total of 891
      patients were recruited for this study, with a mean age of 36.4 ± 8.9 years with 
      a male-to-female ratio of 1.3:1. Postoperative pain management satisfaction score
      for patients (98%) who had pain 8-h postoperative period was 4.8 ± 1.6.
      Similarly, 96.4% of the patients who had pain 24 h postoperatively scored 2.8 ±
      1.7. Majority of the patients 481 (54%) were of the American Society of
      Anesthesiologist physical Class II. Most of the patients underwent general
      surgery using the technique of general anesthesia. Conclusion:: This study
      indicated that the perception and level of patient's satisfaction regarding
      postoperative pain management are inadequate. The health professionals and policy
      makers should be aware that postoperative pain management is suboptimal, as
      patients still have severe postoperative pain. Therefore, the need for improved
      postoperative pain management.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential of Flavonoids in Pain and Inflammation: Mechanisms of
      Action, Pre-Clinical and Clinical Data, and Pharmaceutical Development.
LID - 762
AB  - Pathological pain can be initiated after inflammation and/or peripheral nerve
      injury. It is a consequence of the pathological functioning of the nervous system
      rather than only a symptom. In fact, pain is a significant social, health, and
      economic burden worldwide. Flavonoids are plant derivative compounds easily found
      in several fruits and vegetables and consumed in the daily food intake.
      Flavonoids vary in terms of classes, and while structurally unique, they share a 
      basic structure formed by three rings, known as the flavan nucleus. Structural
      differences can be found in the pattern of substitution in one of these rings.
      The hydroxyl group (–OH) position in one of the rings determines the mechanisms
      of action of the flavonoids and reveals a complex multifunctional activity.
      Flavonoids have been widely used for their antioxidant, analgesic, and
      anti-inflammatory effects along with safe preclinical and clinical profiles. In
      this review, we discuss the preclinical and clinical evidence on the analgesic
      and anti-inflammatory proprieties of flavonoids. We also focus on how the
      development of formulations containing flavonoids, along with the understanding
      of their structure-activity relationship, can be harnessed to identify novel
      flavonoid-based therapies to treat pathological pain and inflammation.

TI  - Conquering the pneumococcal nemesis with oral antibiotics.
PG  - 65-8
AB  - Introduction: Streptococcus pneumoniae endocarditis (SPE) occurs in <3% of all EI
      cases due to the evolution of penicillin and vaccination. However,
      immunocompromised and unvaccinated patients are still at grave risk.Case: A
      58-year-old African American male who used alcohol and intravenous (IV) drugs
      presented with confusion, fever, and hemoptysis. He had coarse rhonchi with a
      grade 2/5 holosystolic apical murmur. CT chest showed diffuse bilateral
      infiltrates. Blood cultures were positive for pansensitive Streptococcus
      pneumoniae. Echocardiogram demonstrated large vegetations on the anterior and
      posterior leaflets of the mitral valve with flail leaflet and severe eccentric
      mitral regurgitation. Patient was started on IV ceftriaxone, but after 3 weeks of
      therapy, he wished to leave against medical advice. He was discharged on
      combination oral therapy with successful resolution of SPE on
      follow-up.Discussion: Invasive pneumococcus is highly virulent causing
      irreversible valvular destruction or death.IV beta-lactams are first-line
      treatment, but there are currently no guideline-recommended alternatives for oral
      therapy. Recent data suggest partial oral therapy may be noninferior to IV only
      therapy.Conclusion: Switching to oral combination antibiotics after at least 2
      weeks of IV therapy is an acceptable alternative to treat SPE.

TI  - Risk factors for pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations in long-term care
      facility residents: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 47
AB  - Background: Older adults who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at
      particularly high risk for infection, morbidity and mortality from pneumonia and 
      influenza (P&I) compared to individuals of younger age and those living outside
      institutional settings. The risk factors for P&I hospitalizations that are
      specific to LTCFs remain poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the
      incidence of P&I hospitalization and associated person- and facility-level
      factors among post-acute (short-stay) and long-term (long-stay) care residents
      residing in LTCFs from 2013 to 2015. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study,
      we used Medicare administrative claims linked to Minimum Data Set and LTCF-level 
      data to identify short-stay (< 100 days, index = admission date) and long-stay
      (100+ days, index = day 100) residents who were followed from the index date
      until the first of hospitalization, LTCF discharge, Medicare disenrollment, or
      death. We measured incidence rates (IRs) for P&I hospitalization per 100,000
      person-days, and estimated associations with baseline demographics, geriatric
      syndromes, clinical characteristics, and medication use using Cox regression
      models. Results: We analyzed data from 1,118,054 short-stay and 593,443 long-stay
      residents. The crude 30-day IRs (95% CI) of hospitalizations with P&I in the
      principal position were 26.0 (25.4, 26.6) and 34.5 (33.6, 35.4) among short- and 
      long-stay residents, respectively. The variables associated with P&I varied
      between short and long-stay residents, and common risk factors included: advanced
      age (85+ years), admission from an acute hospital, select cardiovascular and
      respiratory conditions, impaired functional status, and receipt of antibiotics or
      Beers criteria medications. Facility staffing and care quality measures were
      important risk factors among long-stay residents but not in short-stay residents.
      Conclusions: Short-stay residents had lower crude 30- and 90-day incidence rates 
      of P&I hospitalizations than long-stay LTCF residents. Differences in risk
      factors for P&I between short- and long-stay populations suggest the importance
      of considering distinct profiles of post-acute and long-term care residents in
      infection prevention and control strategies in LTCFs. These findings can help
      clinicians target interventions to subgroups of LTCF residents at highest P&I
      risk.

TI  - Dental caries and periodontal disease among people who use drugs: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
LID - 44
AB  - Background: The aim of our study was to perform a systematic review of the
      literature and meta-analysis in order to investigate relationship between drug
      use and oral health. Methods: We searched for studies in English published before
      July 1, 2019 on PsycINFO, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, and Web of Science. We assessed
      the relationship between drug use (methamphetamines, heroin; opiates; crack,
      cocaine and cannabis as dependent variables) and reported tooth loss, periodontal
      disease, or decayed, missing, and filled teeth index as an independent variable. 
      The data were analyzed using Stata 12.0 software. Results: We initially
      identified 1836 potential articles (with 1100 duplicates) and screened the
      remaining 736 titles and abstracts, comprising 54 studies. In the next step, we
      evaluated the full-texts; 44 studies were excluded, accordingly. In total, we
      included 10 publications in the meta-analysis. Drug type was associated with
      periodontal disease (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.8–2.6) and pooled estimates showed that
      type of drug used increased the odds of the number of decayed, missed and filled 
      teeth (DMFT) (OR 4.11; 95% CI 2.07–8.15) respectively. Conclusions: The
      analytical challenges of segregating the impact of individual drug types on oral 
      health diseases mean that investigations on the direct relationship between oral 
      health status and drug use are limited. Developing programs to improve potential 
      confounding with various substances and addressing the dental health needs of
      people who use drugs is vital if we are to improve their overall quality of life.

TI  - Combination of post-fascia iliaca compartment block and dexmedetomidine in pain
      and inflammation control after total hip arthroplasty for elder patients: a
      randomized control study.
LID - 42
AB  - Objective: This study aims to investigate the efficiency of fascia iliaca
      compartment block (FICB) combined with dexmedetomidine (DEX) in postoperative and
      inflammation management for elder patients after total hip arthroplasty. Methods:
      The present randomized controlled study included a total of 119 elder patients
      who received total hip arthroplasty in our hospital from March 2016 to December
      2018. These patients were divided into three groups: control group, patients
      received routine general anesthesia; FICB group, patients received additional
      FICB after surgery; and combined group, patients received both pre-treatment of
      DEX and post-treatment of fascia iliaca compartment block. The serum levels of
      interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by ELISA.
      The visual analog scale (VAS) score was measured at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after
      surgery, and the patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) pressing time
      within 48 h after surgery was also recorded. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index
      (PSQI) was used to measure the sleep quality before and at 1 month after surgery.
      Results: The VAS scores were significantly lower in patients in the combined
      group, when compared with the other two groups, at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after
      surgery. In addition, the VAS scores at all time points were significantly lower 
      in the FICB group than the control group. The PCIA pressing times were also
      remarkably lower in the combined group. At 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery, the
      serum levels of these inflammatory factors were the lowest in the combined group,
      and the PSQI scores were significantly lower in the combined group, when compared
      with the other two groups, while the control group had the highest PSQI scores
      among the three groups. There was no severe side effects and significant
      difference observed. Conclusion: FICB combined with DEX reduced the postoperative
      pain, improved the sleep condition, and decreased the serum levels of
      inflammatory factors after total hip arthroplasty.

TI  - Genotoxic Properties of Synthetic Cannabinoids on TK6 Human Cells by Flow
      Cytometry.
LID - 1150
AB  - Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS) include several classes of substances such as
      synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs), an emerging alternative to marijuana, easily
      purchasable on internet. SCBs are more dangerous than Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol as 
      a consequence of their stronger affinities for the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which
      may result in longer duration of distinct effects, greater potency, and toxicity.
      The information on SCBs cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and long-term
      effects is scarce. This fact suggests the urgent need to increase available data 
      and to investigate if some SCBs have an impact on the stability of genetic
      material. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the evaluation of the
      mutagenic effect of different SCBs belonging to indole- and indazole-structures. 
      The analyzes were conducted in vitro on human TK6 cells and mutagenicity were
      measured as micronucleus fold increase by flow cytometry. Our results have
      highlighted, for the first time, the mutagenic capacity of four SCBs, in
      particular in terms of chromosomal damage induction. We underline the serious
      potential toxicity of SCBs that suggests the need to proceed with the studies of 
      other different synthetic compounds. Moreover, we identified a method that allows
      a rapid but effective screening of NPS placed on the market increasingly faster.

TI  - The Role of Dietary Antioxidants in the Pathogenesis of Neurodegenerative
      Diseases and Their Impact on Cerebral Oxidoreductive Balance.
LID - 435
AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive diseases of the nervous system that
      lead to neuron loss or functional disorders. Neurodegenerative diseases require
      long-term, sometimes life-long pharmacological treatment, which increases the
      risk of adverse effects and a negative impact of pharmaceuticals on the patients’
      general condition. One of the main problems related to the treatment of this type
      of condition is the limited ability to deliver drugs to the brain due to their
      poor solubility, low bioavailability, and the effects of the blood-brain barrier.
      Given the above, one of the main objectives of contemporary scientific research
      focuses on the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. As disorders related to 
      the competence of the antioxidative system are a marker in all diseases of this
      type, the primary prophylactics should entail the use of exogenous antioxidants, 
      particularly ones that can be used over extended periods, regardless of the
      patient’s age, and that are easily available, e.g., as part of a diet or as diet 
      supplements. The paper analyzes the significance of the oxidoreductive balance in
      the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Based on information published
      globally in the last 10 years, an analysis is also provided with regard to the
      impact of exogenous antioxidants on brain functions with respect to the
      prevention of this type of diseases.

      parenteral nutrition consensus update 2017.
LID - 59
AB  - Background: The first consensus standardised neonatal parenteral nutrition
      formulations were implemented in many neonatal units in Australia in 2012. The
      current update involving 49 units from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore,
      Malaysia and India was conducted between September 2015 and December 2017 with
      the aim to review and update the 2012 formulations and guidelines. Methods: A
      systematic review of available evidence for each parenteral nutrient was
      undertaken and new standardised formulations and guidelines were developed.
      Results: Five existing preterm Amino acid-Dextrose formulations have been
      modified and two new concentrated Amino acid-Dextrose formulations added to
      optimise amino acid and nutrient intake according to gestation. Organic phosphate
      has replaced inorganic phosphate allowing for an increase in calcium and
      phosphate content, and acetate reduced. Lipid emulsions are unchanged, with both 
      SMOFlipid (Fresenius Kabi, Australia) and ClinOleic (Baxter Healthcare,
      Australia) preparations included. The physicochemical compatibility and stability
      of all formulations have been tested and confirmed. Guidelines to standardise the
      parenteral nutrition clinical practice across facilities have also been
      developed. Conclusions: The 2017 PN formulations and guidelines developed by the 
      2017 Neonatal Parenteral Nutrition Consensus Group offer concise and practical
      instructions to clinicians on how to implement current and up-to-date evidence
      based PN to the NICU population.

TI  - Renal insufficiency plays a crucial association factor in severe knee
      osteoarthritis-induced pain in patients with total knee replacement: A
      retrospective study.
LID - e19125
AB  - Pain, the main symptom of osteoarthritis (OA), can lead to functional disability 
      in patients with knee OA. Understanding the association factors related to knee
      pain is important since preventing OA-induced disabilities can be achieved by
      modifying these pain-associated issues. Therefore, this study was aimed to
      investigate the association factors for OA-induced knee pain in Taiwanese
      patients who received total knee replacements (TKR).In this retrospective study, 
      357 subjects who had undergone TKR at the Taipei Municipal Wan-Fang Hospital were
      recruited. The distribution of pain severity among patients with knee OA was
      evaluated. Demographic data and clinical parameters were analyzed to determine
      relationships between these variables and the severity of knee OA pain.Of the 357
      patients studied, 54% and 33% had moderate and severe knee pain, respectively.
      Furthermore, a multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that serum
      creatinine (>1.5 mg/dL) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
      (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) were significantly associated with severe knee pain in OA
      patients. A significant correlation between severe knee pain and serum creatinine
      or eGFR was demonstrated by Pearson correlations.Taken together, the renal
      insufficiency defined by an elevated serum creatinine or a low eGFR in OA
      patients who required TKR was associated with severe knee pain. These variables
      must be considered while treating knee OA pain, especially in those patients with
      severe pain.

TI  - Opioid-Free Cesarean Section with Bilateral Quadratus Lumborum Catheters.
PG  - 17-20
AB  - Introduction: Post-operative pain control following cesarean section delivery
      (CD) is an important topic of discussion given the lack of consensus on a
      narcotic-sparing analgesic regimen. We describe the case of an elective CD with
      narcotic-free pain control using continuous bilateral posterior quadratus
      lumborum (QL) blockade as the primary mode of analgesia. Case Report: The patient
      is a 36-year-old female, G3P1, who presented at 37 weeks of gestation in active
      labor scheduled for elective primary CD. A spinal anesthetic was performed at
      L4–L5 with hyperbaric 0.75% bupivacaine, without intrathecal morphine. Bilateral 
      posterior QL catheters were placed under sterile conditions with 20 mL of 0.25%
      bupivacaine per side. Continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine was then started at
      10 mL/hour per side. The patient’s pain was controlled with QL catheters and a
      multimodal pain regimen consisting of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and
      acetaminophen. The patient reported a resting pain score of 0 with a dynamic pain
      score of 3 out of 10 throughout her recovery. She was discharged on
      post-operative (post-op) day 3 and the catheters were removed without any
      complications. Discussion: The gold standard for pain control following CD is
      intrathecal morphine; however, its use has many adverse effects. Bilateral
      single-shot QL blocks following CD have been proven to decrease opioid
      consumption but its limited duration has minimal advantage over intrathecal
      morphine and patients continue to require oral narcotics for analgesia. With the 
      use of QL catheters and a multimodal pain regimen, it may be possible to achieve 
      opioid-free CD for the post-op period.

TI  - Role of Melatonin in the Regulation of Pain.
PG  - 331-43
AB  - Melatonin is a pleiotropic hormone synthesized and secreted mainly by the pineal 
      gland in vertebrates. Melatonin is an endogenous regulator of circadian and
      seasonal rhythms. Melatonin is involved in many physiological and
      pathophysiological processes demonstrating antioxidant, antineoplastic,
      anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Accumulating evidence has
      revealed that melatonin plays an important role in pain modulation through
      multiple mechanisms. In this review, we examine recent evidence for melatonin on 
      pain regulation in various animal models and patients with pain syndromes, and
      the potential cellular mechanisms.

TI  - Buprenorphine to reverse respiratory depression from methadone overdose in
      opioid-dependent patients: a prospective randomized trial.
LID - 44
AB  - Background: Naloxone is the usual drug used in opioid-induced respiratory
      depression but it has a short half-life, precipitates withdrawal in dependent
      patients, and thus for persistent reversal of long-acting opioids has to be given
      by titrated doses and infusions. The partial agonist buprenorphine has a much
      longer duration of action and causes less severe withdrawal, but still should
      largely reverse respiratory depression induced by full agonist opioids. We aimed 
      to compare the efficacy/safety of buprenorphine and naloxone in reversing
      respiratory depression in methadone-poisoned opioid-dependent patients. Methods: 
      Patients with methadone-induced respiratory depression were randomized to receive
      naloxone (titrated doses), or lower or higher doses of buprenorphine (10 μg/kg or
      15 μg/kg). The primary outcome was immediate reversal of respiratory depression. 
      We also recorded acute opioid withdrawal, need for intubation/recurrent apnea,
      repeated doses of opioid antagonists, length of hospital stay, other morbidity,
      and mortality. The study was registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical
      Trials (Trial ID: 18265; Approval code: IRCT2015011020624N1). Results:
      Eighty-five patients were randomized; 55/56 patients who received buprenorphine
      had rapid reversal of respiratory depression, which persisted for at least 12 h. 
      Naloxone was effective in 28/29 patients, but often required very high titrated
      doses (thus delaying time to respond) and prolonged infusions. Intubation (8/29
      vs 5/56) and opioid withdrawal (15/29 vs 7/56) were less common with
      buprenorphine. There were no serious complications or deaths in those receiving
      buprenorphine. The 15-μg/kg buprenorphine dose appeared to provide a longer
      duration of action, but precipitated withdrawal more frequently than the 10-μg/kg
      dose. Conclusion: Buprenorphine appears to be a safe and effective substitute for
      naloxone in overdosed opioid-dependent patients. Further studies are warranted to
      explore the optimal dosing strategy for buprenorphine to consistently maintain
      reversal of respiratory depression but not precipitate withdrawal. Trial

TI  - Protocol for a multi-site study of the effects of overdose prevention education
      with naloxone distribution program in Skåne County, Sweden.
LID - 49
AB  - Background: Continuously high rates of overdose deaths in Sweden led to the
      decision by the Skåne County to initiate the first regional take-home naloxone
      program in Sweden. The project aims to study the effect of overdose prevention
      education and naloxone distribution on overdose mortality in Skåne County.
      Secondary outcome measures include non-fatal overdoses and overdose-related harm 
      in the general population, as well as cohort-specific effects in study
      participants regarding overdoses, mortality and retention in naloxone program.
      Methods: Implementation of a multi-site train-the-trainer cascade model was
      launched in June 2018. Twenty four facilities, including opioid substitution
      treatment units, needle exchange programs and in-patient addiction units were
      included for the first line of start-up, aspiring to reach a majority of
      individuals at-risk within the first 6 months. Serving as self-sufficient
      naloxone hubs, these units provide training, naloxone distribution and study
      recruitment. During 3 years, questionnaires are obtained from initial training,
      follow up, every sixth month, and upon refill. Estimated sample size is 2000
      subjects. Naloxone distribution rates are reported, by each unit, every 6 months.
      Medical diagnoses, toxicological raw data and data on mortality and cause of
      death will be collected from national and regional registers, both for included
      naloxone recipients and for the general population. Data on vital status and
      treatment needs will be collected from registers of emergency and prehospital
      care. Discussion: Despite a growing body of literature on naloxone distribution, 
      studies on population effect on mortality are scarce. Most previous studies and
      reports have been uncontrolled, thus not being able to link naloxone distribution
      to survival, in relation to a comparison period. As Swedish registers present the
      opportunity to monitor individuals and entire populations over time, conditions
      for conducting systematic follow-ups in the Swedish population are good, serving 
      the opportunity to study the impact of large scale overdose prevention education 
      and naloxone distribution and thus fill the knowledge gap. Trial registration:

TI  - Where Have the Periods Gone? The Evaluation and Management of Functional
      Hypothalamic Amenorrhea.
PG  - 18-27
AB  - Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is a common cause of amenorrhea in
      adolescent girls. It is often seen in the setting of stress, weight loss, or
      excessive exercise. FHA is a diagnosis of exclusion. Patients with primary or
      secondary amenorrhea should be evaluated for other causes of amenorrhea before a 
      diagnosis of FHA can be made. The evaluation typically consists of a thorough
      history and physical examination as well as endocrinological and radiological
      investigations. FHA, if prolonged, can have significant impacts on metabolic,
      bone, cardiovascular, mental, and reproductive health. Management often involves 
      a multidisciplinary approach, with a focus on lifestyle modification. Depending
      on the severity, pharmacologic therapy may also be considered. The aim of this
      paper is to present a review on the pathophysiology, clinical findings,
      diagnosis, and management approaches of FHA in adolescent girls.

TI  - Dysmenorrhea, Endometriosis and Chronic Pelvic Pain in Adolescents.
PG  - 7-17
AB  - Most adolescents will experience discomfort during menstruation. Due to
      normalization of dysmenorrhea, there is delay to diagnosis and treatment.
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories are a first line treatment. Adolescents can
      safely be offered menstrual suppression with combined hormonal contraception, and
      progestin-only options. When the above are ineffective, gonadotropin releasing
      hormone agonists with add back treatment can be considered. Transabdominal
      ultrasound is indicated when first line treatments do not improve symptoms.
      Endometriosis should be considered in adolescents who experience ongoing pain
      despite medical treatment. If laparoscopy is performed and endometriosis
      visualized, it should be treated with either excision or ablation. Women with
      endometriosis should be counselled on menstrual suppression until fertility is
      desired. Management of chronic pain requires the involvement of a
      multi-disciplinary team.

LID - e033337
AB  - Objectives: The primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility of a newly developed, 
      neuroscience-based, alcohol and other drug (AOD) use prevention programme, ‘The
      Illicit Project’, in Australian older adolescents. The secondary aim is to
      investigate the impact of the programme on students’ drug literacy levels (a
      combination of knowledge, attitudes and skills). Design: A pilot study examining 
      the feasibility of The Illicit Project in Australian schools was conducted.
      Participants: Students aged 15–19 years from two secondary schools and a youth
      centre and 11 teachers and health professionals from various organisations in
      Sydney were recruited. Intervention: The intervention consisted of three 90 min
      workshops delivered by trained facilitators within a month. Primary and secondary
      measures: Students completed a drug literacy questionnaire before and after
      intervention. All participants (students, teachers and health professionals)
      completed an evaluation questionnaire postprogramme delivery. A paired-sample
      t-test and descriptive analytics were performed. Results: Students (n=169)
      demonstrated a significant increase in drug literacy levels from preintervention 
      to postintervention (t(169) = −13.22, p<0.0001). Of students evaluating the
      programme (n=252), over threequarters agreed that The Illicit Project was good or
      very good (76%), that the neuroscience content was interesting (76%) and relevant
      (81%), and that they plan to apply the concepts learnt to their own lives (80%). 
      In addition, all teachers and health professionals (n=11) agreed that the
      programme was feasible and valid for schools and perceived the programme to be
      effective in reducing the harms and use of AOD. Conclusions: There is evidence to
      suggest that The Illicit Project is credible and feasible in the school
      environment and there are preliminary data to suggest it may help to improve drug
      literacy levels in young people. A large-scale evaluation trial of the
      intervention will be conducted to determine the programme’s effectiveness in
      minimising the harms of AOD in older adolescents.

TI  - Sustained Release of Levobupivacaine, Lidocaine, and Acemetacin from
      Electrosprayed Microparticles: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.
LID - 1093
AB  - In this study, we explored the release characteristics of analgesics, namely
      levobupivacaine, lidocaine, and acemetacin, from electrosprayed
      poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles. The drug-loaded particles
      were prepared using electrospraying techniques and evaluated for their
      morphology, drug release kinetics, and pain relief activity. The morphology of
      the produced microparticles elucidated by scanning electron microscopy revealed
      that the optimal parameters for electrospraying were 9 kV, 1 mL/h, and 10 cm for 
      voltage, flow rate, and travel distance, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared
      spectrometry indicated that the analgesics had been successfully incorporated
      into the PLGA microparticles. The analgesic-loaded microparticles possessed low
      toxicity against human fibroblasts and were able to sustainably elute
      levobupivacaine, lidocaine, and acemetacin in vitro. Furthermore, electrosprayed 
      microparticles were found to release high levels of lidocaine and acemetacin
      (well over the minimum therapeutic concentrations) and levobupivacaine at the
      fracture site of rats for more than 28 days and 12 days, respectively.
      Analgesic-loaded microparticles demonstrated their effectiveness and sustained
      performance for pain relief in fracture injuries.

TI  - Evaluation of Endotracheal Tube Cuff Pressure and the Use of Three Cuff Inflation
      Syringe Devices in Dogs.
LID - 39
AB  - Over-inflation of an endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff may lead to tracheal mucosal
      irritation, tracheal wall ischemia or necrosis, whereas under-inflation increases
      the risk of pulmonary aspiration as well as leaking anesthetic gas and polluting 
      the environment. The objectives of this two-phase study were to (1) identify the 
      incidence of improper ETT cuff inflation (both over- and under-inflation) using
      the minimum occlusive volume (MOV) technique coupled with a regular injectable
      syringe in the anesthetized dogs, and (2) evaluate the performance of two
      commercially available inflation syringe devices (Tru-Cuff and AG Cuffill®) with 
      the regular injectable syringe in inflating the ETT cuff to a recommended safe
      cuff pressure range (20–30 cmH2O). Dogs undergoing general anesthesia at Purdue
      Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital were included. The ETT cuff pressure was
      assessed with an aneroid manometer after the syringe inflation. The results of
      the first objective showed that a total of 80 dogs enrolled and that 50 of these 
      80 dogs required ETT cuff inflation. Among the 50 dogs, only 14% had proper ETT
      cuff inflation; 76% of the ETT cuffs were over-inflated and 10% were
      under-inflated. Ninety dogs were enrolled for the second objective study and they
      were randomly and equally assigned to the three syringe device treatment groups. 
      The results showed that 80% of the ETT cuffs were over-inflated in the regular
      injectable syringe treatment group, whereas only 6.7% and 3.3% ETT cuffs were
      over-inflated in the Tru-Cuff and AG Cuffill® syringe treatment groups,
      respectively. The AG Cuffill® syringe treatment group had a significantly (p <
      0.05) higher percentage of properly inflated ETT cuffs (86.7%) compared to the
      other two groups (regular injectable syringe [3.3%]; Tru-Cuff syringe [50%]. We
      concluded that there was a high incidence of improper ETT cuff inflation when
      using MOV technique coupled with a regular injectable syringe. The use of an AG
      Cuffill® syringe significantly reduced improper ETT cuff inflation.

TI  - How orthopedic surgeons can impact opioid use and dependence in shoulder
      arthroplasty.
PG  - 105-8
AB  - Background: Considering that the United States is facing a crisis with opioid
      misuse and orthopedists are the third largest provider of these prescriptions, it
      is important to delineate risk factors associated with use and dependence. Our
      purpose was to identify risk factors for and patient characteristics of increased
      opioid use and postoperative opioid dependence in total shoulder arthroplasty
      (TSA) patients. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 752 TSA patients who
      underwent surgery in 1 health care system from 2012-2016. Recorded variables
      included demographics and opioid prescriptions from prescription drug monitoring 
      programs. Preoperative and postoperative opioid dependence was defined as
      continuous opioid prescriptions for at least 3 months prior to or after surgery. 
      Statistical analyses and odds ratio analyses were performed. Results: Of the 752 
      patients in total, 241 (32%) became or remained postoperatively dependent whereas
      68% (511) were able to wean off of opioids by 3 months. In the preoperatively
      dependent cohort, only 27% were able to wean off opioids at 1 month and 53%, by 3
      months postoperatively. Odds ratio calculations showed that patients with
      preoperative opioid use had a 3.52 (95% confidence interval, 2.433-5.089) times
      increased risk of postoperative dependence compared with opioid-naive patients.
      Of those receiving postoperative opioid refills, 69% were provided these refills 
      by their orthopedic surgeons. Discussion and conclusions: Although the majority
      of TSA patients weaned off of opioids after surgery, our results demonstrate a
      3.5 times higher risk of postoperative dependence in patients who used
      preoperative opioids. Orthopedists were major contributors to continued
      postoperative opioid use, and increased efforts to minimize opioid prescriptions 
      before, during, and after TSA may help curtail overuse and dependence. These
      results highlight the hazard that preoperative opioid use entails for shoulder
      arthritis patients.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided superficial cervical plexus block for analgesia in patients
      undergoing craniotomy via suboccipital retrosigmoid approach: study protocol of a
      randomised controlled trial.
LID - e034003
AB  - Introduction: Scalp nerve block has been proven to be an alternative choice to
      opioids in multimodal analgesia. However, for the infratentorial space-occupying 
      craniotomy, especially the suboccipital retrosigmoid craniotomy, scalp nerve
      block is insufficient. Methods and analysis: The study is a prospective,
      single-centre, randomised, paralleled-group controlled trial. Patients scheduled 
      to receive elective suboccipital retrosigmoid craniotomy will be randomly
      assigned to the superficial cervical plexus block group or the control group.
      After anaesthesia induction, superficial cervical plexus nerve block will be
      performed under the guidance of ultrasound. The primary outcome is the cumulative
      consumption of sufentanil by the patient-controlled intravenous analgesia pump
      within 24 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes include the cumulative
      consumption of sufentanil at other four time points and numerical rating scale
      pain severity score. Ethics and dissemination: The protocol (version number: 2.0,
      10 April 2019) has been approved by the Ethics Review Committee of China
      Registered Clinical Trials (Ethics Review No. ChiECRCT-20190047). The findings of
      this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific
      conferences. Trial registration number: NCT04036812

TI  - Technology-Based Substance Use Interventions: Opportunities for
      Gender-Transformative Health Promotion.
LID - 992
AB  - Drawing on data from a scoping review on sex, gender and substance use, this
      narrative review explores the use of gender-informed and technology-based
      approaches in substance use prevention and health promotion interventions. With
      an ever-changing landscape of new technological developments, an understanding of
      how technology-based interventions can address sex, gender, and intersecting
      equity considerations related to substance use is warranted. Current
      technology-based approaches to substance use prevention and health promotion are 
      described and assessed for gender-specific and gender transformative outcomes,
      and limitations are discussed related to inclusivity, access, confidentiality,
      and a dearth of research on technological approaches that integrate gender-based 
      analysis. A call for action designed to advance technology-based health
      promotion, prevention and brief interventions that address gender equity
      simultaneously with substance use is proposed.

TI  - Role of β-Caryophyllene in the Antinociceptive and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of
      Tagetes lucida Cav. Essential Oil.
LID - 675
AB  - Tagetes lucida Cav. (Asteraceae) is an ancient medicinal plant commonly used to
      alleviate pain. Nevertheless, scientific studies validating this property are
      lacking in the literature. Animal models of pain were used to evaluate the
      antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of T. lucida essential oil
      (TLEO) and a bioactive metabolite. The chemical constitution and possible
      toxicity of the extract and the mechanism of action of β-caryophyllene were also 
      explored. Temporal course curves and dose–response graphics were generated using 
      TLEO (0.1–10 mg/kg or 3.16–31.62 mg/kg) and β-caryophyllene (3.16–10 mg/kg).
      Metamizole (80 mg/kg) and indomethacin (20 mg/kg) were used as reference drugs in
      the formalin assay and writhing test in rats and mice, respectively. The
      β-caryophyllene mechanism of action was explored in the presence of naloxone (1
      mg/kg), flumazenil (10 mg/kg), WAY100635 (0.16 mg/kg), or nitro-l-arginine methyl
      ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg) in the formalin test in rats. GC/MS analysis
      demonstrated the presence of geranyl acetate (49.89%), geraniol (7.92%), and
      β-caryophyllene (6.27%). Significant and dose-dependent antinociceptive response 
      was produced by TLEO and β-caryophyllene without the presence of gastric damage. 
      In conclusion, β-caryophyllene was confirmed as a bioactive compound in the T.
      lucida analgesic properties by involving the participation of receptors like
      opioids, benzodiazepines, and Serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A), as well as nitric
      oxide.

      Buprenorphine/Naloxone Maintenance Therapy: Avoiding Opioids in Patients at Risk 
      for Relapse.
PG  - 295-9
AB  - The opioid crisis in the United States has been pandemic. As such, anesthesia
      providers are frequently faced with patients who have a history of opioid abuse
      or are currently receiving chronic therapy for such disorders. The chronic
      administration of medications such as buprenorphine-naloxone can impact the
      choice of perioperative anesthesia and pain control. Furthermore, the
      postoperative administration of opioids may lead to relapse in patients with a
      history of opioid abuse. We present a 26-year-old male with a history of opioid
      abuse on maintenance therapy with buprenorphine-naloxone, who presented for
      median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and pulmonary valve replacement. The
      perioperative implications of buprenorphine-naloxone and implementation of
      multimodal analgesia are discussed, along with options to decrease or eliminate
      the perioperative use of opioids.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with postoperative inadequate
      analgesia after single-port VATS in Chinese population.
LID - 38
AB  - Background: Postoperative inadequate analgesia following video-assisted
      thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a common and significant clinical problem. While 
      genetic polymorphisms may play role in the variability of postoperative analgesia
      effect, few studies have evaluated the associations between genetic mutations and
      inadequate analgesia after single-port VATS. Methods: Twenty-eight single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 18 selected genes involved in pain
      perception and modulation were genotyped in 198 Chinese patients undergoing
      single-port VATS. The primary outcome was the occurrence of inadequate analgesia 
      in the first night and morning after surgery which was defined by a comprehensive
      postoperative evaluation. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to
      identify the association between genetic variations and postoperative inadequate 
      analgesia. Results: The prevalence of postoperative inadequate analgesia was
      45.5% in the present study. After controlling for age and education level,
      association with inadequate analgesia was observed in four SNPs among three genes
      encoding voltage-gated sodium channels. Patients with the minor allele of
      rs33985936 (SCN11A), rs6795970 (SCN10A), and 3312G > T (SCN9A) have an increased 
      risk of suffering from inadequate analgesia. While the patients carrying the
      minor allele of rs11709492 (SCN11A) have lower risk experiencing inadequate
      analgesia. Conclusions: We identified that SNPs in SCN9A, SCN10A, and SCN11A play
      a role in the postoperative inadequate analgesia after single-port VATS. Although
      future larger and long-term follow up studies are warranted to confirm our
      findings, the results of the current study may be utilized as predictors for
      forecasting postoperative analgesic effect for patients receiving this type of
      surgery. Trial registration: This study was retrospectively registered in the
      ClinicalTrials.gov Registry (NCT03916120) on April 16, 2019.

TI  - Anterior quadratus lumborum block for postoperative recovery after total hip
      arthroplasty: a study protocol for a single-center, double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial.
LID - 142
AB  - Background: Appropriate pain management is essential to improve the postoperative
      recovery after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Various case reports have indicated 
      that anterior quadratus lumborum block (QLB) provides effective postoperative
      analgesia in lower limb surgeries. However, few randomized controlled trials have
      confirmed the efficacy of anterior QLB for lower limb surgeries. The aim of this 
      single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial is to confirm the
      efficacy of anterior QLB for postoperative recovery after THA. Methods: The
      participants will be randomly assigned to either the anterior QLB or placebo
      groups, using a set of random numbers for the allocation sequence. Only
      pharmacists will be aware of the allocations; other investigators will be blinded
      until study completion. After induction of general anesthesia, anterior QLB will 
      be performed by using 0.25% levobupivacaine or normal saline. Fentanyl will be
      administered according to blood pressure change during the surgery. The primary
      outcome will be the quality of recovery 40 score (QoR-40). Secondary outcomes
      will include the visual analog scale score of pain intensity at rest and
      movement, intraoperative and postoperative doses of fentanyl, and incidence of
      postoperative nausea and vomiting. Statistical analysis will be performed by
      using the Student’s t test, Mann–Whitney U test, and Fisher’s exact test as
      appropriate. A P value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant. Discussion: The results of our study will reveal whether anterior
      QLB is effective for postoperative recovery after THA. Trial registration: UMIN
      Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000032255. Registered on 15 April 2018.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of selective COX-2 inhibitors for postoperative pain
      management in patients after total knee/hip arthroplasty: a meta-analysis.
LID - 39
AB  - Background: Many selective cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors are currently used
      in clinical practice. COX-2 inhibitors have good anti-inflammatory, analgesic,
      antipyretic effects, and gastrointestinal safety. However, the analgesic effects 
      and adverse reactions of COX-2 after total knee/hip arthroplasty (TKA/THA) are
      not fully known. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of selective
      COX-2 inhibitors in postoperative pain management in patients receiving TKA/THA. 
      Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved from medical
      literature databases. Risk ratios (RR) Std mean difference (SMD) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to analyze the primary and safety
      endpoints. Results: In total, 18 articles (23 trial comparisons) were retrieved
      comprising 3104 patients. Among them, 1910 patients (61.5%) were randomized to
      the experimental group whereas 1194 patients (38.5%) were randomized to the
      control group. The primary endpoints were the patients’ VAS score at rest or on
      ambulation (within 3 days). We found that VAS score in patients that received
      selective COX-2 inhibitor was significantly lower compared to those of the
      control group. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that selective COX-2
      inhibitor therapy is effective, safe, and reliable in relieving postoperative
      pain of THA/TKA.

TI  - Airway Pressure Release Ventilation: A Review of the Evidence, Theoretical
      Benefits, and Alternative Titration Strategies.
LID - 1179548420903297
AB  - Objective:: To review the theoretical benefits of airway pressure release
      ventilation (APRV), summarize the evidence for its use in clinical practice, and 
      discuss different titration strategies. Data Source:: Published randomized
      controlled trials in humans, observational human studies, animal studies, review 
      articles, ventilator textbooks, and editorials. Data Summary:: Airway pressure
      release ventilation optimizes alveolar recruitment, reduces airway pressures,
      allows for spontaneous breathing, and offers many hemodynamic benefits. Despite
      these physiologic advantages, there are inconsistent data to support the use of
      APRV over other modes of ventilation. There is considerable heterogeneity in the 
      application of APRV among providers and a shortage of information describing
      initiation and titration strategies. To date, no direct comparison studies of
      APRV strategies have been performed. This review describes 2 common management
      approaches that bedside providers can use to optimally tailor APRV to their
      patients. Conclusion:: Airway pressure release ventilation remains a form of
      mechanical ventilation primarily used for refractory hypoxemia. It offers unique 
      physiological advantages over other ventilatory modes, and providers must be
      familiar with different titration methods. Given its inconsistent outcome data
      and heterogeneous use in practice, future trials should directly compare APRV
      strategies to determine the optimal management approach.

TI  - A logistic regression analysis comparing minimalistic approach and intubation
      anaesthesia in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve
      replacement.
LID - e0227345
AB  - Aims: Patients with postoperative delirium (POD) after transcatheter aortic valve
      replacement (TAVR) are ventilated and hospitalized longer and suffer increased
      in-hospital mortality. This study hypothesized that a minimalistic approach with 
      conscious sedation during transfemoral aortic valve replacement (TF-AVR) protects
      against delirium, time of mechanical ventilation, and increased length of stay in
      intensive care unit (ICU) compared to intubation anaesthesia. Methods and
      results: 308 patients which underwent TF-AVR in our centre between 01/2013 and
      08/2017 were retrospectively evaluated regarding postoperative delirium, time of 
      mechanical ventilation, and days in ICU. TF-AVR was performed with intubation
      anaesthesia in 245 patients and with conscious sedation in 63. The operative risk
      estimated by the logEUROScore was similar in both groups (intubation: 13.28
      +/-9.06%, conscious sedation: 12.24 +/-6.77%, p = 0.395). In the conscious
      sedation group procedure duration was shorter (0.61 +/-0.91h vs. 1.75 +/-0.96h,
      p<0.001). The risk for intraprocedural complications was not influenced by the
      anaesthesia method (OR conscious sedation instead of intubation 1.66, p = 0.117),
      but days on ICU (-2.21 days, p<0.0001) and minutes of mechanical ventilation
      (-531.2 min, p < 0.0001) were reduced. Furthermore, the risk of POD was decreased
      when TF-AVR was performed under conscious sedation (6.35% vs. 18.18%, OR 0.29, p 
      = 0.021). Conclusions: Time of mechanical ventilation, risk of POD, and days on
      ICU were substantially reduced in patients who underwent TF-AVR under conscious
      sedation. Our data suggest that TF-AVR with conscious sedation is safe with a
      beneficial postoperative course in clinical practice, and should be considered
      the favoured approach.

      breathlessness in patients with cancer.
LID - e000603
AB  - Breathlessness is among the most common and deteriorating symptoms in patients
      with advanced cancer, which may worsen towards the end of life. Breathlessness in
      patients with estimated life expectancy of weeks to days has unique clinical
      features: it tends to worsen rapidly over days to hours as death approaches often
      despite current symptom control measures. Breathlessness in patients during the
      last weeks to days of life can be called ‘terminal breathlessness’. While
      evidence has accumulated for the management of breathlessness in patients with
      cancer who are not dying, such evidence may not be fully applied to terminal
      breathlessness. Only a few studies have investigated the best practice of
      terminal breathlessness in patients with cancer. In this paper, we summarise the 
      current evidence for the management of terminal breathlessness, and propose
      future directions of clinical research.

TI  - Vocal Music Therapy for Chronic Pain: A Mixed Methods Feasibility Study.
PG  - 113-22
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and
      preliminary effects of a vocal music therapy (VMT) program on chronic pain
      management.Design: A mixed methods intervention design was used in which
      qualitative data were embedded within a randomized controlled trial.Setting: An
      urban nurse-management health center on the East Coast of the United
      States.Subjects: Participants (N = 43) were predominantly Black (79%) and female 
      (76.7%) with an average pain duration of 10 years.Intervention: Participants were
      randomly allocated to a 12-week VMT program or a waitlist control.Outcome
      measures: We tracked consent rate (percentage of participants enrolled out of
      total number screened), attrition rate, and treatment adherence. We used PROMIS® 
      (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) tools to measure pain 
      interference, pain-related self-efficacy, pain intensity, depression, anxiety,
      positive effect, and well-being, ability to participate in social activities, and
      satisfaction with social roles at baseline and week 12. VMT participants also
      completed the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale. We conducted
      semistructured interviews to better understand participants' experience of the
      intervention.Results: The consent rate was 56%. The attrition rate was 23%. Large
      treatment effects (partial eta squared) were obtained for self-efficacy (0.20),
      depression (0.26), and ability to participate in social activities (0.24). Medium
      effects were found for pain intensity (0.10), anxiety (0.06), positive effect,
      and well-being (0.06), and small effects for pain interference (0.03) and
      satisfaction with social roles (0.03). On average, participants felt moderately
      better after completion of the VMT program (M = 4.93, standard deviation = 1.98).
      Qualitative findings suggest that VMT resulted in better self-management of pain,
      enhanced psychological well-being, and stronger social and spiritual
      connections.Conclusions: Recruitment into the 12-week program was challenging,
      but quantitative and qualitative findings suggest significant benefits of VMT for
      chronic pain management.

TI  - Gender Norms, Roles and Relations and Cannabis-Use Patterns: A Scoping Review.
LID - 947
AB  - Currently, boys and men use cannabis at higher rates than girls and women, but
      the gender gap is narrowing. With the legalization of recreational cannabis use
      in Canada and in multiple US states, these trends call for urgent attention to
      the need to consider how gender norms, roles and relations influence patterns of 
      cannabis use to inform health promotion and prevention responses. Based on a
      scoping review on sex, gender and cannabis use, this article consolidates
      existing evidence from the academic literature on how gender norms, roles and
      relations impact cannabis-use patterns. Evidence is reviewed on: adherence to
      dominant masculine and feminine norms and cannabis-use patterns among adolescents
      and young adults, and how prevailing norms can be both reinstated or reimagined
      through cannabis use; gendered social dynamics in cannabis-use settings; and the 
      impact of gender roles and relations on cannabis use among young adults of
      diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. Findings from the review are
      compared and contrasted with evidence on gender norms, roles and relations in the
      context of alcohol and tobacco use. Recommendations for integrating gender
      transformative principles in health promotion and prevention responses to
      cannabis use are provided.

TI  - Outcomes of intrathecal analgesia in multiparous women undergoing normal vaginal 
      delivery: A randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 109-17
AB  - Background and Aims:: Although intrathecal analgesia is an effective option
      during labour, there is a need to establish sustainable and assured analgesia
      during the entire labour process. We aimed to assess the effect of adding
      dexmedetomidine, fentanyl or morphine to low-dose bupivacaine-dexamethasone for
      intrathecal labour analgesia in multiparous women. Methods:: This was a
      triple-blind, randomised controlled trial that included 140 multiparous women.
      Eligible women were randomly allocated to have intrathecal
      bupivacaine-dexamethasone with dexmedetomidine (group D), fentanyl (group F),
      morphine (group M) or saline (placebo) (group C). The duration of analgesia,
      intrathecal block characteristics and maternal and foetal outcomes were assessed 
      and analysed. Results:: The longest analgesia duration and S1 regression time was
      recorded in group D followed by groups M, F and C, respectively, with statistical
      significance between all of them (P < 0.001). The shortest analgesia onset time
      and the highest sensory levels were recorded in group D followed by group F then 
      group M with statistical significance between all of them (P < 0.001 and 0.003,
      respectively). Visual analogue scale values were comparable among groups M, F and
      D (P > 0.05) at most of the measurement time points and at the peak of the last
      uterine contraction before delivery while being significantly lower than those in
      group C (P < 0.001). However, there were similar motor block characteristics and 
      normal neonatal outcomes in all groups. Conclusion:: In comparison to morphine
      and fentanyl, dexmedetomidine addition to intrathecal bupivacaine-dexamethasone
      significantly prolonged the duration and accelerated the onset of labour
      analgesia, with a good maternal and neonatal outcome.

TI  - Erector spinae plane block for complete surgical anaesthesia and postoperative
      analgesia for breast surgeries: A prospective feasibility study of 30 cases.
PG  - 118-24
AB  - Background and Aims:: Several regional anaesthesia techniques have been described
      for carcinoma of the breast surgeries in the past but all of them failed to
      provide adequate surgical anaesthesia and are associated with multiple
      complications, thus limiting their use. This prospective study was designed to
      assess the efficacy of erector spinae plane (ESP) block to provide complete
      surgical anaesthesia without general anaesthesia (GA) and postoperative analgesia
      in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) surgery. Methods::
      Thirty females of the American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I,
      II or III scheduled for MRM were included in the study to receive unilateral
      ultrasound-guided ESP block preoperatively (25 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with
      dexamethasone 8 mg on the operating side). The primary objective of the study was
      to evaluate the efficacy of ESP block to provide complete surgical anaesthesia in
      terms of total number of cases converted to GA. Results:: Our study shows that
      ultrasound-guided single-shot ESP block provided complete surgical anaesthesia in
      all the patients within an average of 31.50 minutes and an average long-lasting
      postoperative analgesia of 41.73 hours following MRM. Conclusion:: Our study
      proves that ESP block is a novel, predictable, secure, and safe option for
      carcinoma of the breast surgery. Thus, ESP block would surely provide a clinical 
      advantage in these population group.

TI  - Effects of Labor Epidural Analgesia on Short Term Neonatal Morbidity.
PG  - 59-70
AB  - Background: Epidural Analgesia (EA) is the most effective and most commonly used 
      method for pain relief during labor. Some researchers have observed an
      association between EA and increased neonatal morbidity. But this observation was
      not consistent in many other studies. Objectives: The primary objective of the
      study was to examine whether exposure to epidural analgesia increased the risk of
      NICU admission. The secondary objectives included the risks of clinical
      chorioamnionitis, instrumental delivery, neonatal depression, respiratory
      distress, birth trauma, and neonatal seizure during the first 24 hours of life.
      Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study involving 2360 low-risk
      nulliparous women who delivered at AWH, Qatar, during the two years between
      January 2016 December and 2017. Short-term neonatal outcomes of the mothers who
      received EA in active labor were compared with a similar population who did not
      receive EA. As secondary objectives, labor parameters like maternal temperature
      elevation, duration of the second stage of labor, and instrumental delivery were 
      compared. Results: Significantly higher numbers of neonates were admitted to the 
      NICU from the EA group (P<0.001, OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.46). They were more
      likely to have respiratory distress (P=0.01, OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.07), birth
      injuries (P=0.02, OR =1.71, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.74), admission temperature>37.5 °C
      (P=0.04, OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 11.49), need for oxygen on the first day
      (P=0.04, OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.07) and receive antibiotics (P<0.001, OR
      2.06,95% CI 1.47 to 2.79). There was no difference in the Apgar score at 1 minute
      (P=0.12), need of resuscitation at birth (P=0.05), neonatal white cell count
      (P=0.34), platelet count (P=0.38) and C reactive protein (P=0.84). Mothers who
      received EA had a lengthier second stage (P<0.001), temperature elevation >37.5°C
      (P<0.001, OR 7.40, 95% CI 3.93 to 13.69) and instrumental delivery (P<0.001, OR
      2.13, 95% CI 1.69 to 2.68). Conclusion: EA increases NICU admission, antibiotic
      exposure, neonatal birth injuries, need for positive pressure ventilation at
      birth, and respiratory distress in the first 24 hours of life. Mothers on
      epidural analgesia have prolonged second stage of labor, a higher rate of
      instrumental delivery, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, fetal distress, and
      temperature elevation.

TI  - Excess abdominal fat is associated with cutaneous allodynia in individuals with
      migraine: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 9
AB  - Objective: To investigate the specific relationship between cutaneous allodynia
      (CA) and the percentages of body fat (BF) and abdominal fat in migraineurs.
      Additionally, we compared serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers in patients
      with and without CA. Background: Excess abdominal fat might facilitate
      progressive changes in nociceptive thresholds causing central sensitization,
      clinically reflected as CA, which could drive migraine progression. Methods: This
      prospective cohort study included 80 patients with migraine (mean age 39 years,
      81.2% female) and 39 non-migraine controls. We analysed each participant’s
      height, body weight, and body mass index (BMI). The amount and distribution of BF
      was also assessed by air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and ViScan,
      respectively. We analysed serum levels of markers of inflammation, during
      interictal periods. Results: We studied 52 patients with episodic migraine (EM)
      and 28 with chronic migraine (CM). Of the 80 patients, 53 (53.8%) had CA.
      Migraineurs with CA had a higher proportion of abdominal fat values than patients
      without CA (p = 0.04). The independent risk factors for CA were the use of
      migraine prophylaxis (OR 3.26, 95% CI [1.14 to 9.32]; p = 0.03), proportion of
      abdominal fat (OR 1.13, 95% CI [1.01 to 1.27]; p = 0.04), and presence of sleep
      disorders (OR 1.13, 95% CI [00.01 to 1.27]; p = 0.04). The concordance
      correlation coefficient between the ADP and BMI measurements was 0.51 (0.3681 to 
      0.6247). CA was not correlated with the mean plasma levels of inflammatory
      biomarkers. Conclusions: There is a relation between excess abdominal fat and CA.
      Abdominal obesity might contribute to the development of central sensitization in
      migraineurs, leading to migraine chronification.

      follow-up studies using a national sample cohort.
LID - 1749
AB  - This study was aimed to explore the bidirectional association between depression 
      and peptic ulcers. The ≥20-year-old participants of the Korean National Health
      Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort from 2002 to 2013 were included in the
      study. In study I, 30,306 depression patients were 1:4 matched with 121,224
      control I participants. In study II, 127,590 peptic ulcer patients were 1:1
      matched with 127,590 control II participants. The stratified Cox-proportional
      hazards models were used to analyse the hazard ratio (HR) of depression for
      peptic ulcers (study I) and of peptic ulcers for depression (study II). A total
      of 8.9% (2,703/ 30,306) of depression patients and 7.3% (8,896/ 121,224) of
      patients in the control I group had peptic ulcers (P < 0.001). The depression
      group had an adjusted HR for peptic ulcers that was 1.14-fold higher than that of
      the control I group (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.09–1.19, P < 0.001). A 
      total of 6.4% (8,144/ 127,590) of peptic ulcer patients and 3.5% (4,515/127,590) 
      of patients in the control II group had depression (P < 0.001). The peptic ulcer 
      group had an adjusted HR for depression that was 1.68-fold higher than that of
      the control II group (95% CI = 1.62–1.74, P < 0.001). Depression and peptic
      ulcers exhibited a bidirectional relationship.

TI  - A kinetic method for measuring agonist efficacy and ligand bias using high
      resolution biosensors and a kinetic data analysis framework.
LID - 1766
AB  - The kinetics/dynamics of signaling are of increasing value for G-protein-coupled 
      receptor therapeutic development, including spatiotemporal signaling and the
      kinetic context of biased agonism. Effective application of signaling kinetics to
      developing new therapeutics requires reliable kinetic assays and an analysis
      framework to extract kinetic pharmacological parameters. Here we describe a
      platform for measuring arrestin recruitment kinetics to GPCRs using a high
      quantum yield, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, and a data analysis
      framework to quantify the recruitment kinetics. The sensor enabled high temporal 
      resolution measurement of arrestin recruitment to the angiotensin AT1 and
      vasopressin V2 receptors. The analysis quantified the initial rate of arrestin
      recruitment (kτ), a biologically-meaningful kinetic drug efficacy parameter, by
      fitting time course data using routine curve-fitting methods. Biased agonism was 
      assessed by comparing kτ values for arrestin recruitment with those for Gq
      signaling via the AT1 receptor. The kτ ratio values were in good agreement with
      bias estimates from existing methods. This platform potentially improves and
      simplifies assessment of biased agonism because the same assay modality is used
      to compare pathways (potentially in the same cells), the analysis method is
      parsimonious and intuitive, and kinetic context is factored into the bias
      measurement.

TI  - Some t-tests for N-of-1 trials with serial correlation.
LID - e0228077
AB  - N-of-1 trials allow inference between two treatments given to a single
      individual. Most often, clinical investigators analyze an individual’s N-of-1
      trial data with usual t-tests or simple nonparametric methods. These simple
      methods do not account for serial correlation in repeated observations coming
      from the individual. Existing methods accounting for serial correlation require
      simulation, multiple N-of-1 trials, or both. Here, we develop t-tests that
      account for serial correlation in a single individual. The development includes
      effect size and precision calculations, both of which are useful for study
      planning. We then use Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate statistical properties
      of these serial t-tests, namely, Type I and II errors, and confidence interval
      widths, and compare these statistical properties to those of analogous usual
      t-test. The serial t-tests clearly outperform the usual t-tests commonly used in 
      reporting N-of-1 results. Examples from N-of-1 clinical trials in fibromyalgia
      patients and from a behavioral health setting exhibit how accounting for serial
      correlation can change inferences. These t-tests are easily implemented and more 
      appropriate than simple methods commonly used; however, caution is needed when
      analyzing only a few observations.

TI  - Intravenous versus subcutaneous route pharmacokinetics of paracetamol
      (acetaminophen) in palliative care patients: study protocol for a randomized
      trial (ParaSCIVPallia).
LID - 138
AB  - Background: Among palliative care (PC) patients who are administered paracetamol,
      the subcutaneous (SC) route is often an alternative to the intravenous (IV)
      route. Yet pharmacological and clinical data on whether these are equivalent
      pharmacokinetically are lacking. Many French palliative teams are now empirically
      using paracetamol by the SC route, but there are no data to support this
      practice. This trial aims to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of
      paracetomol between the IV and SC routes in PC patients. Methods/design: This is 
      a randomized, open, crossover study in two PC centers. The primary endpoints are 
      AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, Vd, and t1/2. All adverse events will be reported for a
      safety analysis. Twenty adult PC patients with an IV device having spontaneous
      pain not related to care, with a numeric pain rate scale > 3/10, or having a
      systematic prescription of paracetamol as the usual treatment will be included.
      All patients also have to meet all eligibility criteria. Conclusion: This is the 
      first study comparing PK parameters for IV paracetamol versus SC paracetamol in
      PC patients. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03944044. Registered on 4

TI  - Factors associated with the successful completion of a substance rehabilitation
      programme at a psychiatric training hospital.
LID - 1255
AB  - Background: Comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders are common and
      present several treatment challenges. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine
      which patient and substance factors are associated with the completion of a
      substance rehabilitation programme in psychiatric inpatients. Setting: The study 
      was conducted at the Substance Rehabilitation Unit (SRU) at Weskoppies Hospital, 
      a psychiatric training hospital in South Africa, which offers a 6-week programme 
      at the hospital for psychiatric inpatients. Methods: This descriptive,
      retrospective hospital-based study was carried out comparing completers and
      non-completers of the SRU programme with respect to patient and substance
      factors. All patients accepted into the SRU during 2013–2014 were included (n =
      119). Data were collected over a year (2016–2017) from the clinical files, SRU
      referral forms, SRU attendance register, hospital computerised demographic
      records, nursing notes and administration files using a data collection sheet
      designed by the researchers for this study. Comparison between completers and
      non-completers was performed using Chi-Square or Fisher’s Exact tests. Results:
      The SRU accepted 119 patients from January 2013 to December 2014. The majority of
      the sample were involuntary patients (n = 39), 30–49 years old (n = 57), male (n 
      = 89), unmarried (n = 112), never having received a disability grant (n = 27),
      unemployed (n = 96) and with a Grade 8–11 education (n = 49). Substance-induced
      psychotic disorders (n = 39), schizophrenia (n = 29) and bipolar disorders (n =
      22) were found to be common. Frequent medical comorbidities included head injury 
      (n = 27), cardiovascular disease (n = 18) and HIV reactivity (n = 7). Cannabis (n
      = 98), alcohol (n = 94) and nicotine (n = 90) were the most frequently used
      substances. Level of education (p = 0.004), disability grant status (p = 0.004), 
      Nyaope use (p = 0.001) and nicotine use (p = 0.049) were statistically seen to be
      significantly associated with completion. Psychiatric diagnoses and general
      medical comorbidity were not associated with completion. Conclusions: This study 
      has yielded several results in areas that have not yet been well researched in
      South Africa. Risk factors for non-completion may include lower levels of
      education, being on a disability grant and using Nyaope or nicotine, but may vary
      in different settings. Future research should focus on identifying further
      factors that may affect completion of substance rehabilitation in psychiatric
      inpatients, the role of disability grants in patients with co-occurring disorders
      and the effect of Nyaope and nicotine use on treatment outcomes in this
      population. Effective and accessible interventions to assist vulnerable patients 
      also need to be identified.

TI  - Using routine referral data for patients with knee and hip pain to improve access
      to specialist care.
LID - 66
AB  - Background: Referral letters from primary care contain a large amount of
      information that could be used to improve the appropriateness of the referral
      pathway for individuals seeking specialist opinion for knee or hip pain. The
      primary aim of this study was to evaluate the content of the referral letters to 
      identify information that can independently predict an optimal care pathway.
      Methods: Using a prospective longitudinal design, a convenience sample of
      patients with hip or knee pain were recruited from orthopaedic, specialist
      general practice and advanced physiotherapy practitioner clinics. Individuals
      completed a Knee or hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Score at initial consultation and 
      after 6 months. Participant demographics, body mass index, medication and
      co-morbidity data were extracted from the referral letters. Free text of the
      referral letters was mapped automatically onto the Unified Medical Language
      System to identify relevant clinical variables. Treatment outcomes were extracted
      from the consultation letters. Each outcome was classified as being an optimal or
      sub-optimal pathway, where an optimal pathway was defined as the one that results
      in the right treatment at the right time. Logistic regression was used to
      identify variables that were independently associated with an optimal pathway.
      Results: A total of 643 participants were recruited, 419 (66.7%) were classified 
      as having an optimal pathway. Variables independently associated with having an
      optimal care pathway were lower body mass index (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.0
      p = 0.004), named disease or syndromes (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8, p = 0.02) and 
      taking pharmacologic substances (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.3, p = 0.02). Having a
      single diagnostic procedure was associated with a suboptimal pathway (OR 0.5, 95%
      CI 0.3 to 0.9 p < 0.001). Neither Knee nor Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome scores were
      associated with an optimal pathway. Body mass index was found to be a good
      predictor of patient rated function (coefficient − 0.8, 95% CI -1.1, − 0.4
      p < 0.001). Conclusion: Over 30% of patients followed sub-optimal care pathway,
      which represents potential inefficiency and wasted healthcare resource. A core
      data set including body mass index should be considered as this was a predictor
      of optimal care and patient rated pain and function.

TI  - N-Acetylcysteine causes analgesia in a mouse model of painful diabetic
      neuropathy.
LID - 1744806920904292
AB  - N-Acetylcysteine, one of the most prescribed antioxidant drugs, enhances pain
      threshold in rodents and humans by activating mGlu2 metabotropic glutamate
      receptors. Here, we assessed the analgesic activity of N-acetylcysteine in the
      streptozotocin model of painful diabetic neuropathy and examined the effect of
      N-acetylcysteine on proteins that are involved in mechanisms of nociceptive
      sensitization. Mice with blood glucose levels ≥250 mg/dl in response to a single 
      intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg) were used for the 
      assessment of mechanical pain thresholds. Systemic treatment with
      N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg, i.p., either single injection or daily injections
      for seven days) caused analgesia in diabetic mice. N-acetylcysteine-induced
      analgesia was abrogated by the Sxc− inhibitors, sulfasalazine (8 mg/kg, i.p.),
      erastin (30 mg/kg, i.p.), and sorafenib (10 mg/kg, i.p.), or by the mGlu2/3
      receptor antagonist, LY341495 (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Repeated administrations of
      N-acetylcysteine in diabetic mice reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the dorsal
      region of the lumbar spinal cord. The analgesic activity of N-acetylcysteine was 
      occluded by the MEK inhibitor, PD0325901 (25 mg/kg, i.p.), the TRPV1 channel
      blocker, capsazepine (40 mg/kg, i.p.), or by a cocktail of NMDA and mGlu5
      metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (memantine, 25 mg/kg, plus MTEP,
      5 mg/kg, both i.p.). These findings offer the first demonstration that
      N-acetylcysteine relieves pain associated with diabetic neuropathy and holds
      promise for the use of N-acetylcysteine as an add-on drug in diabetic patients.

TI  - Diagnostic Value of Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography/Computed
      Tomography Scans with Tc-99m HDP in Cervicogenic Headache.
LID - 399
AB  - A cervicogenic headache (CEH) is difficult to diagnose due to its varied
      pathology. We evaluated the usefulness of single-photon emission computed
      tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in diagnosing CEH and its
      interventional treatment. Retrospectively, 23 patients diagnosed with CEH between
      March 2016 to August 2018 were allocated to SPECT/CT (n = 11) and control (n =
      12) groups. The SPECT/CT group was further stratified into SPECT/CT(+) and
      SPECT/CT(-) groups according to the presence of positive findings. Patients in
      the SPECT/CT group underwent an intra-articular injection at a radiologically
      verified lesion site, whereas those in the control group underwent third
      occipital nerve block. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with the visual analog
      scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), and global perceived effect (GPE) scale
      at baseline, and at one, three, and six months postoperatively. The SPECT/CT
      group showed less VAS, NDI, and GPE scores at six months postoperatively (2.91 ± 
      2.30 vs. 4.42 ± 1.62, p = 0.08; 38.00 ± 16.54 vs. 48.7 ± 12.40, p = 0.093; 2.00 ±
      1.41 vs. 3.17 ± 1.11, p = 0.039). Successful responders at six months
      postoperatively were higher in the SPECT/CT(+) group than in the control group
      (75% vs. 0%). SPECT/CT can identify arthritic changes and accurately define
      therapeutic targets.

TI  - Comprehensive Care for Patients with Sarcoidosis.
LID - 390
AB  - Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease, associated with significant
      morbidity and impaired quality of life. Treatment is aimed at recovering organ
      function, reducing symptom burden and improving quality of life. Because of the
      heterogeneity and variable disease course, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary
      approach to care is needed. Comprehensive care includes not only pharmacological 
      interventions, but also supportive measures aimed at relieving symptoms and
      improving quality of life. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most
      recent knowledge regarding different aspects of care and propose a structured
      approach to sarcoidosis management.

TI  - Is a Combination of the Serratus Intercostal Plane Block and Rectus Sheath Block 
      Superior to the Bilateral Oblique Subcostal Transversus Abdominis Plane Block in 
      Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy?
PG  - 34-7
AB  - Objective: The serratus intercostal plane block (SIPB) is a recently defined
      interfascial plane block. The oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane block
      (OSTAP) is another type of interfascial plane block, and it is also used as a
      part of multimodal analgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
      (LC). In this retrospective study, we evaluated the effects of the bilateral
      OSTAP and a combination of the right SIPB and bilateral rectus sheath block (RSB)
      on the postoperative pain and analgesia requirement in patients undergoing LC.
      Materials and Methods: Data of the patients who underwent LC between May 2018 and
      November 2018 were evaluated retrospectively. Postoperative pain was evaluated
      using the numeric rating scale (NRS), and 24-hour tramadol consumption and rescue
      analgesia requirements were compared. Results: Bilateral OSTAP was applied to 47 
      patients, and SIPB+RSB was applied to 25 patients. Postoperative pain scores were
      similar between the two groups. In the first 24 hours, tramadol requirement in
      the SIPB+RSB group was significantly lower than in the OSTAP block group
      (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the NRS
      averages at different time frames between the two block groups. Conclusion: We
      found that when SIPB is used as a part of multimodal analgesia in a combination
      with RSB in LS, it improves the quality of analgesia and decreases the analgesic 
      requirement compared to patients undergoing a bilateral OSTAP block. Randomized
      controlled trials are necessary to compare the effects of SIPB alone and in a
      combination with other blocks in LC.

TI  - Robotic adrenalectomy: when and how?
PG  - S166-72
AB  - Currently, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is considered as the preferred technique to
      manage adrenal tumors. However, there are no prospective randomized studies
      evaluating this strategy. With the recent advances in surgical equipment and the 
      widespread of robotic technology, a robotic approach is considered as an
      interesting option in some medical centers. This approach seems to be feasible
      and safe but high-level evidence of its benefits is still lacking. This review
      summarizes indications, advantages and drawbacks of robotic adrenalectomy and
      describes its surgical technique.

TI  - Association Between Formulary Coverage and Use of Abuse-Deterrent Prescription
      Opioids, Risk for Abuse or Overdose, and Associated Healthcare Resource
      Utilization.
PG  - 21-31
AB  - Background: Significant public health concerns exist regarding the misuse and
      abuse of prescription opioids. Abuse-deterrent formulation (ADF) opioids may be
      leveraged as an important tool for combating the current opioid crisis.
      Objectives: To evaluate the relationships between ADF opioid formulary coverage
      and the ADF utilization rate, the risk for opioid abuse or overdose, opioid abuse
      or overdose–related healthcare resource utilization, and medical costs within a
      calendar year. Methods: This cross-sectional multiyear panel study included
      adults prescribed an opioid medication in 2015 or 2016. We analyzed the medical
      and pharmacy claims linked to health plan benefit design data. An ADF
      opioid—including reformulated oxycodone hydrochloride (HCl) controlled-release
      (CR; reformulated OxyContin), morphine sulfate and naltrexone HCl
      extended-release (ER; Embeda), and hydrocodone bitartrate ER (Hysingla ER)—was
      considered covered if it was listed on the health plan's formulary. Generalized
      linear models were used to assess the association between ADF opioid formulary
      coverage and the study outcomes. Results: Of 1,350,607 eligible patients, those
      enrolled in health plans with coverage of ADF opioids were more likely to fill a 
      prescription for an ADF opioid than those enrolled in plans that did not cover
      ADF opioids. The risk for opioid abuse or overdose was significantly lower among 
      patients enrolled in plans with broader ADF coverage (adjusted odds ratio [OR],
      0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86–0.95 for oxycodone HCl CR only vs no ADF
      coverage; adjusted OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.67–0.73 for oxycodone HCl CR plus ≥1 ADF
      opiods vs no ADF; adjusted OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.73–0.81 for oxycodone HCl CR plus 
      ≥1 ADF opiods vs oxycodone HCl CR only; all P <.0001). Approximately 15% and 25% 
      reductions in the opioid abuse or overdose–related hospitalization rate and
      medical costs were observed for those in the oxycodone HCl CR plus ≥1 ADF opioids
      coverage group versus those without ADF opioid coverage. Conclusions: Broad
      formulary coverage of ADF opioids is associated with reduced rates of opioid
      abuse or overdose in real-world managed care populations. Health plan
      administrators and policymakers may consider improving the formulary coverage of 
      ADF opioids as a strategy to ensure appropriate patient access to necessary pain 
      medications while mitigating risk for opioid abuse or overdose.

TI  - ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THERAPEUTIC DRY NEEDLING.
PG  - 103-13
AB  - Background: There is a paucity of literature about the adverse events associated 
      with Therapeutic Dry Needling (TDN). Much of the literature surrounding adverse
      events associated with TDN has been extrapolated from the acupuncture literature.
      Given that acupuncture and TDN are distinctly different in their application and 
      proposed mechanisms, adverse events associated with TDN should be examined
      specifically. Purpose: To determine and report the type of adverse events
      associated with the utilization of TDN. Study Design: Prospective Questionnaire
      Methods: Four hundred and twenty physical therapists participated in this study. 
      Information related to minor and major adverse events that occurred during 20,464
      TDN treatment sessions was collected. Each physical therapist respondent was
      asked to fill out two weekly self-reported electronic surveys over a six-week
      period. One survey was related to “minor adverse events” (i.e. pain, bleeding,
      bruising), while the other was related to “major adverse events” (i.e.
      pneumothorax, excessive bleeding, prolonged aggravation). Following the six-week 
      period, descriptive statistics were used to describe the adverse events (AE)
      associated with TDN and calculate the frequencies of those events. Results: A
      total of 7,531 minor AE's were reported, indicating that 36.7% of the reported
      TDN treatments resulted in a minor AE. The top three minor AE's were bleeding
      (16%), bruising (7.7%), and pain during dry needling (5.9 %). The average ratio
      of minor AE's for all respondents across all weeks was 0.53 or approximately one 
      event for every two patients. Twenty major AE's were reported out of the 20,494
      treatments for a rate of <0.1% (1 per 1,024 TDN treatments). No associations were
      noted between the frequency of adverse events and the number of patients treated,
      practitioner age, level of education, years in practice, level of training or
      months experience with dry needling. Conclusion: Expected minor AE's such as mild
      bleeding, bruising, and pain during TDN were common and major AE's were rare.
      Physical therapists and other medical practitioners need to be aware of the risks
      of TDN. Based on the findings of this study the overall risk of a major adverse
      event during TDN is small. Level of Evidence: 3, survey research

TI  - The Opioid System and Food Intake: Use of Opiate Antagonists in Treatment of
      Binge Eating Disorder and Abnormal Eating Behavior.
PG  - 41-63
AB  - Eating disorders (EDs) and substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly co-occur,
      especially in conjunction with affective syndromes, yet little is known about
      opiate abuse and ED symptoms in patients on naltrexone-bupropion therapy.
      Moreover, evidence suggests that the opioid system can also be regarded as one of
      the major systems regulating the anticipatory processes preceding binge eating
      episodes. The lack of evidence in the effectiveness of psychotherapy treatment in
      addition to psychotropic mediations compounds the difficulties in stabilizing
      individuals with EDs. This article aims to exhaustively review literature
      relating to the use of opioid antagonists in the management of binge eating
      disorder (BED) and other abnormal eating habits and how this can be augmented by 
      the use of psychological approaches to come up with the most effective therapy or
      combination of therapies to manage these conditions. Although this approach is
      promising, it has not been evaluated. A review of the literature pertaining to
      the use of naltrexone in patients with EDs was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO
      and MEDLINE. We selected 63 relevant articles published between 1981 and 2018 and
      those written in English. Search terms included “Opioid antagonists”,
      “naltrexone”, “bupropion” and “Psychotherapy” each combined with “Binge Eating
      Disorder”, “Bulimia Nervosa”, “Anorexia Nervosa”, “Eating Disorder”, “EDNOS” and 
      “Obesity”. While working with these articles, we also identified several problems
      related to use of these methods in real clinical practice. Seventy-seven articles
      were reviewed, and 63 were selected for inclusion. Data obtained from these
      sources confirmed that the blockade of opioid receptors diminishes food intake.
      More recent findings also indicate that the combination of bupropion and
      naltrexone can induce weight loss. Augmentation of this by introducing
      psychotherapy may lead to better outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was
      the most frequently recommended psychotherapy intervention, showing efficacy for 
      EDs and chemical addictions as documented by most of the studies, but with
      uncertain efficacy when utilized as augmentation strategy. There are limited data
      supporting the use of psychotherapy in augmentation of standard therapy in ED;
      however, there is evidence to support that psychotherapy is safe in this
      population and has been effective in cases of patients with opiate addiction with
      and without psychiatric comorbidities as well as BED. More research is needed to 
      establish treatment guidelines. Combining pharmacotherapeutic and
      psychotherapeutic interventions leads to the achievement of a better outcome in
      managing patients with EDs. Involving families or the use of support groups
      increases chances of adherence to the prescribed interventions resulting in
      higher rates of remission. However, it is clear that all of these interventions
      must occur in the context of a comprehensive treatment program. We believe that
      patient-specific psychotherapy may not only facilitate the treatment process, but
      also cause significant alterations in eating pattern. This approach for BED may
      lead to more significant treatment outcomes, but this possibility must be tested 
      in larger samples.

      surgery. Methods: Our prospectively maintained anterior urethroplasty database
      was reviewed. Men were identified who underwent anterior urethroplasty surgery by
      a single surgeon (B.R.V.) with the Enhanced Ambulatory Male Urethral Surgery
      (EAMUS) protocol followed by same-day discharge. Patients were contacted within 3
      weeks of surgery and completed validated assessment tools to characterize
      satisfaction with the outpatient experience and with analgesia management. A
      statistical analysis was performed to assess predictors of overall satisfaction
      with same-day discharge following AU surgery. Results: Fifty-seven patients with 
      median age 52.2 years underwent same-day AU surgery between August 2017 and
      October 2018. In total, 46 patients (80.7%) responded to post-discharge surveys
      assessing overall outpatient satisfaction and satisfaction with analgesia. Median
      satisfaction with outpatient experience (scale 1–5) was 5 (IQR 4, 5) with 93.4%
      of patients indicating they were satisfied to very satisfied (4 or 5). Median
      patient satisfaction with analgesia (scale 1–6) was 6 (IQR 5, 6) with 93.4% of
      patients indicating a satisfaction with analgesia score of ≥5 (satisfied to very 
      satisfied). Median number of 5 mg oxycodone tablets used following discharge was 
      3 (IQR 0.75, 5). Postoperative complications occurred in 14 patients (25%) with
      12 (86%) being low grade complications (Clavien-Dindo Classification ≤ II).
      Conclusions: With appropriate preoperative education and peri-operative
      analgesia, anterior urethroplasty surgery can be performed with same-day
      discharge with comparable postoperative complication rates while maintaining
      excellent patient satisfaction. Additional high volume, prospectively collected
      studies are necessary to verify short-term satisfaction rates while confirming
      long-term urethroplasty success rates remain comparable to AU surgery performed
      with next day discharge.

TI  - Methylnaltrexone and Naloxone for Opioid-induced Constipation in the Critical
      Care Setting.
LID - e6829
AB  - Opioid antagonists in the ICU are often a last-line medication given to patients 
      with opioid-induced constipation. Traditionally, patients have been administered 
      nonopioid-based bowel regimens such as senna, peg, and docusate to treat
      constipation. Despite the obvious need to treat acute pain with opioids, side
      effects such as constipation can lead to multiple gastrointestinal (GI)
      complications such as bowel perforation and even death. Specifically,
      opioid-induced constipation (OIC) can be very difficult to treat. We examine
      naloxone and methylnaltrexone (MNTX) assessing GI complications and OIC as well
      as present a patient case which highlights the importance of treating OIC. We
      also evaluate the superior reversal agent of choice when treating OIC in the
      critical care and stepdown unit settings.

      Wastewater-Cased Epidemiology.
LID - 889
AB  - Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia play a major role in global drug
      trade and abuse. Use of amphetamine-type stimulants has increased in the past
      decade in Malaysia. This study aimed to apply wastewater-based epidemiology for
      the first time in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to estimate the consumption of common
      illicit drugs in urban population. Influent wastewater samples were collected
      from two wastewater treatment plants in Kuala Lumpur in the summer of 2017.
      Concentrations of twenty-four drug biomarkers were analyzed for estimating drug
      consumption. Fourteen drug residues were detected with concentrations of up to
      1640 ng/L. Among the monitored illicit drugs, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine 
      (MDMA) or ecstasy had the highest estimated per capita consumptions. Consumption 
      and dose of amphetamine-type stimulants (methamphetamine and MDMA) were both an
      order of magnitude higher than those of opioids (heroin and codeine, methadone
      and tramadol). Amphetamine-type stimulants were the most prevalent drugs,
      replacing opioids in the drug market. The prevalence trend measured by
      wastewater-based epidemiology data reflected the shift to amphetamine-type
      stimulants as reported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Narcotics
      Cooperation Center. Most of the undetected drug residues were new psychoactive
      substances (NPSs), suggesting a low prevalence of NPSs in the drug market.

TI  - Bidirectional Regulation of Opioid and Chemokine Function.
LID - 94
AB  - The opioid family of GPCRs consists of the classical opioid receptors, designated
      μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors, and the orphanin-FQ receptor, and these proteins 
      are expressed on both neuronal and hematopoietic cells. A number of laboratories 
      have reported that an important degree of cross-talk can occur between the opioid
      receptors and the chemokine and chemokine receptor families. As a part of this,
      the opioid receptors are known to regulate the expression of certain chemokines
      and chemokine receptors, including those that possess strong pro-inflammatory
      activity. At the level of receptor function, it is clear that certain members of 
      the chemokine family can mediate cross-desensitization of the opioid receptors.
      Conversely, the opioid receptors are all able to induce heterologous
      desensitization of some of the chemokine receptors. Consequently, activation of
      one or more of the opioid receptors can selectively cross-desensitize chemokine
      receptors and regulate chemokine function. These cross-talk processes have
      significant implications for the inflammatory response, since the regulation of
      both the recruitment of inflammatory cells, as well as the sensation of pain, can
      be controlled in this way.

TI  - Changes in Muscle Activity Patterns and Joint Kinematics During Gait in
      Hemophilic Arthropathy.
LID - 1575
AB  - Hemophilic arthropathy is the result of repetitive intra-articular bleeding and
      synovial inflammation. In people with hemophilic arthropathy (PWHA), very little 
      is known about the neural control of individual muscles during movement. The aim 
      of the present study was to assess if the neural control of individual muscles
      and coordination between antagonistic muscle pairs and joint kinematics during
      gait are affected in PWHA. Thirteen control subjects (CG) walked overground at
      their preferred and slow velocity (1 m/s), and 14 PWHA walked overground at the
      preferred velocity (1 m/s). Joint kinematics and temporal gait parameters were
      assessed using four inertial sensors. Surface electromyography (EMG) was
      collected from gluteus maximus (GMAX), gluteus medius (GMED), vastus medialis
      (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), medial gastrocnemius (MG),
      lateral gastrocnemius (LG), soleus (SOL), tibialis anterior (TA), semitendinosus 
      (ST), and biceps femoris (BF). Waveforms were compared using the time-series
      analysis through statistical parametric mapping. In PWHA compared to CG, EMG
      amplitude during the stance phase was higher for LG (for both velocities of the
      CG), BF (slow velocity only), and ST (preferred velocity only) (p < 0.05).
      Co-contraction during the stance phase was higher for MG-TA, LG-TA, VL-BF, VM-ST,
      LG-VL, and MG-VM (both velocities) (p < 0.05). MG and LG were excited earlier
      (preferred velocity only) (p < 0.05). A later offset during the stance phase was 
      found for VL, BF, and ST (both velocities), and BF and GMAX (preferred velocity
      only) (p < 0.05). In addition, the range of motion in knee and ankle joints was
      lower in PWHA (both velocities) and hip joint (preferred velocity only) (p <
      0.05). In conclusion, the neural control of individual muscles and coordination
      between antagonistic muscles during gait in PWHA differs substantially from
      control subjects.

TI  - Mechanisms of Shared Vulnerability to Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and
      Substance Use Disorders.
LID - 6
AB  - Psychoactive substance use is a nearly universal human behavior, but a
      significant minority of people who use addictive substances will go on to develop
      an addictive disorder. Similarly, though ~90% of people experience traumatic
      events in their lifetime, only ~10% ever develop post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Substance use disorders (SUD) and PTSD are highly comorbid, occurring in 
      the same individual far more often than would be predicted by chance given the
      respective prevalence of each disorder. Some possible reasons that have been
      proposed for the relationship between PTSD and SUD are self-medication of anxiety
      with drugs or alcohol, increased exposure to traumatic events due to activities
      involved in acquiring illegal substances, or addictive substances altering the
      brain’s stress response systems to make users more vulnerable to PTSD. Yet
      another possibility is that some people have an intrinsic vulnerability that
      predisposes them to both PTSD and SUD. In this review, we integrate clinical and 
      animal data to explore these possible etiological links between SUD and PTSD,
      with an emphasis on interactions between dopaminergic, adrenocorticotropic,
      GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurobehavioral mechanisms that underlie different
      emotional learning styles.

LID - 16
AB  - Over the past three decades, the incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell
      carcinoma has increased, primarily related to the spread of human papillomavirus.
      Treatment has always been preferentially unimodal (surgery or radiotherapy) for
      early stage disease and multimodal (surgery with adjuvant therapy or concomitant 
      chemoradiotherapy) for advanced stages. Recently, the surgical approach has
      gained renewed interest due to the morbidity of non-surgical treatments and also 
      to technical innovations. We have coined the term 3Des (3D exoscope surgery) to
      describe the use of the 3D Vitom Exoscope System for transoral surgery of
      oropharyngeal cancers. During the period from June 2017 to May 2018, 10 patients 
      with oropharyngeal cancer were treated by oropharyngeal surgery with the 3Des
      approach at FPO IRCCS Institute of Candiolo. The aim of the present prospective
      study was to evaluate the utility of 3Des for the treatment of early-stage
      oropharyngeal cancer. 3Des could represent a viable alternative to the operating 
      microscope and robotic surgery thanks to its excellent ability to provide 3D
      visual information, depth of field, magnification, image contrast, color imaging,
      and low running costs. It promises great utility in the learning process, with
      the possibility of recording in high definition.

TI  - Childhood Trauma, Cognitive Emotion Regulation and Motivation for Behavior Change
      Among Clients of Opioid Substitution Treatment With and Without Past Year
      Synthetic Cathinone Use During Therapy.
LID - 37
AB  - Background: With a decrease in heroin’s purity and availability in the European
      drug market, Hungarian opioid dependent patients started to substitute heroin
      with novel psychoactive substances (NPS) and especially with synthetic
      cathinones. Goal: This study aims to assess whether clients of opioid
      substitution treatment (OST) with and without a history of synthetic cathinone
      use during therapy differ in (1) the rate and type of experienced childhood
      trauma, (2) the way they cope with negative life events, (3) their motivation to 
      change substance use behavior, (4) the rate of treatment retention. Methods: A
      total of 198 clients of an outpatient centers (Nyírõ Gyula National Institute of 
      Psychiatry and Addictions, Budapest) OST were asked to provide information about 
      their general substance use experiences, including the consumption of NPS during 
      treatment, their childhood traumatic experiences (Childhood Trauma
      Questionnaire), cognitive emotion regulation strategies (Cognitive Emotion
      Regulation Questionnaire), their motivation to change substance use behavior
      (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale) and current psychiatric
      symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory). Baseline data was collected in the summer of 
      2015, while 4 years follow-up data on treatment retention was obtained in the
      summer of 2019. Results: The majority of the clients were male (N = 141, 71.2%), 
      receiving methadone as a substitute for opioids (N = 178, 89.9%), while mean age 
      of the full sample was 39.7 (SD = 6.8). Based on a logistic regression model, the
      odds for past year synthetic cathinone use was higher among clients with more
      severe psychiatric symptoms (B = 0.8, OR = 2.2, p < 0.01) and among clients who
      were in treatment for a shorter period of time (B = 0.1, OR = 0.9, p < 0.05).
      Synthetic cathinone use during treatment was further associated with less
      adaptive strategies to cope with negative life events. Synthetic cathinone use
      was also a risk factor for reduced treatment retention (B = −0.8, OR = 0.4, p <
      0.05) and was associated with lower odds of being member of a latent class with
      less severe psychopathological profile (B = −0.9, OR = 0.4, p < 0.05).
      Conclusion: Synthetic cathinone use during treatment is associated with poorer
      treatment outcomes and might be characterized by more severe psychiatric symptoms
      and amotivation to change substance use among opioid dependent clients.

TI  - Computed tomography-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection for refractory
      pain in patients with spinal metastases: Two case reports.
LID - e18939
AB  - Rationale:: Diagnosing and treating refractory cancer pain have become
      standardized and effective procedures with guidance from the Expert Consensus on 
      Refractory Cancer Pain released in 2017 by the Committee of Rehabilitation and
      Palliative Care of China. Doxorubicin has been used for perineural injection in
      the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain owing to its retrograde sensory ganglion
      resection effect. Our study reports a new fourth-ladder treatment for cancer
      pain: CT-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection for patients with refractory 
      cancer pain caused by paraspinal metastasis. Patient concerns:: A 48-year-old
      female and a 47-year-old male patients suffered from refractory cancer pain over 
      the past months. They had both undergone surgical tumor resection, chemotherapy, 
      and precision radiotherapy but result in limited analgesic effect. The daily oral
      morphine dosage was around 60 to 100 mg and rescue analgesic methods had been
      used at the time. Diagnoses:: Refractory cancer pain in 2 patients with renal
      cancer and hepatobiliary adenocarcinoma. Interventions:: The patients both
      received computed tomography (CT)-guided 1 mL of 0.5% doxorubicin paravertebral
      injection at each affected nerve root segments. Outcomes:: The Visual Analog
      Scale and Douleur Neuropathique four Questions were used for 6-month follow-up,
      and the analgesic requirement was also recorded. The patients enjoyed
      satisfactory analgesia for up to 6 months without adverse reaction. In addition, 
      the oral opioid analgesic doses were significantly reduced after the neurolytic
      block. Lessons:: The CT-guided paravertebral doxorubicin injection was an
      effective fourth-step analgesic interventional technology that allowed our 2
      patients with refractory cancer pain to maintain satisfactory analgesia. This
      analgesia method taken at an appropriate stage, according to the latest analgesic
      concept, results in good analgesia and opioid use reduction. Also, with the
      imaging guidance, only a small amount of neurolytic agent is needed to achieve
      analgesia in a precise and safe way.

TI  - Increased risk of perforated appendicitis in patients with schizophrenia and
      dementia: A population-based case-control study.
LID - e18919
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that patients with psychotic or mental disorders 
      are relatively pain insensitive, resulting in difficulties in the diagnosis of
      acute intra-abdominal diseases requiring emergency surgeries. We aimed to
      evaluate whether central nervous system (CNS) or mental disorders are associated 
      with perforated appendicitis in patients with acute appendicitis.We conducted a
      population-based case-control study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance
      Research database. Patients aged >18 years who had been hospitalized with a
      diagnosis of acute appendicitis between 2000 and 2013 were identified. After 1:1 
      matching for age and sex, 2792 patients with perforated appendicitis (case group)
      and 2792 patients with nonperforated appendicitis (control group) were included. 
      CNS disorders, mental disorders, pain control medication, and several
      comorbidities were analyzed for the odds of appendiceal perforation with 95%
      confidence interval (CI) using the multivariable logistic regression
      model.Schizophrenia and dementia were associated with a high risk of appendiceal 
      rupture in patients with acute appendicitis, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.01 
      for dementia (95% CI: 1.19–3.39, P = .009) and 4.8 for schizophrenia (95% CI:
      1.62–14.19, P = .005). Other factors, such as other CNS disorders, comorbidities,
      and pain control medication, were not associated with the risk of perforated
      appendicitis.Dementia and schizophrenia are associated with perforated
      appendicitis in patients with acute appendicitis. This might be owing to altered 
      pain perception, difficult symptom expression, and delayed hospitalization.
      Further studies are still needed to determine the underlying mechanism and
      confirm the causality.

TI  - Midlife mortality in White non-Hispanic male veterans enrolled in Department of
      Veterans Affairs primary care, 2003–2014.
LID - e03328
AB  - Background: After years of decline in mortality rates in the United States, there
      have been increases in mortality rates in White non-Hispanic Americans ages
      45–54, due to increases in deaths from suicide, poisoning, and alcoholic liver
      disease. Objectives: To determine whether White non-Hispanic middle age male
      Veterans enrolled in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care had
      increased mortality, as found in the general population. Research design:
      Repeated cross-sectional analysis over 12 years to describe trends in death rates
      for men across 3 race/ethnicity groups (White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic,
      Hispanic) and 2 age groups (45–54, 55–64) for the Veteran and general US male
      populations. Subjects: 60 million patient-years for Veterans enrolled in VA
      primary care from 2003 to 2014 and 1.8 million who died during the study period. 
      Measures: All-cause and cause specific death rates for alcoholic liver disease,
      poisoning, and suicide. Results: For White non-Hispanic male Veterans ages 55–64,
      the increase in all-cause mortality from 2003 to 2014 (+309 deaths/100,000) was
      accompanied by significant changes in deaths due to poisoning (+30/100,000),
      alcoholic liver disease (+23/100,000), and suicide (+17/100,000). For US men ages
      55–64, all-cause mortality decreased slightly from 2003-2014 (-22
      deaths/100,000). However, there were increases in death rates due to poisoning
      (+17/100,000), alcoholic liver disease (+14/100,000) and suicide (+11/100,000).
      Conclusions: These disturbing findings for White non-Hispanic Veteran men ages
      55–64 suggest the critical importance of suicide prevention programs as well as
      the importance of high quality integrated health care for both Veteran and
      non-Veteran men.

TI  - Continuous Wound Infiltration of Local Anesthetics in Postoperative Pain
      Management: Safety, Efficacy and Current Perspectives.
PG  - 285-94
AB  - Local infiltration and continuous infusion of surgical wound with anesthetics are
      parts of multimodal analgesia for postoperative pain control. The techniques,
      given the simplicity of execution that does not increase the timing of the
      intervention and does not require additional technical skills, are applied in
      several kinds of surgeries. The continuous wound infiltration can be used for
      days and a variety of continuous delivery methods can be chosen, including
      patient-controlled analgesia, continuous infusion or intermittent bolus. The
      purpose of this narrative review is to analyze the literature, in particular by
      researching the safety, efficacy and current perspectives of continuous wound
      infiltration for postoperative pain management in different surgical settings. We
      have identified 203 articles and 95 of these have been taken into consideration: 
      17 for the lower limb surgery; 7 for the upper limb surgery, 51 for the
      laparotomy/laparoscopic surgery of the abdominopelvic area, 13 studies regarding 
      breast surgery and 7 for cardiothoracic surgery. The analysis of these studies
      reveals that the technique has a variable effectiveness based on the type of
      structure involved: it is better in structures rich in subcutaneous and
      connective tissue, while the effectiveness is limited in anatomic districts with 
      a greater variability of innervation. However, regardless the heterogeneity of
      results, a general reduction in pain intensity and in opioid consumption has been
      observed with continuous wound infiltration: it is an excellent analgesic
      technique that can be included in the multimodal treatment of postoperative pain 
      or represents a valid alternative when other options are contraindicated.

TI  - Brazilian Nutritional Consensus in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation:
      Adults.
LID - AE4530
AB  - The nutritional status of patients submitted to hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant is considered an independent risk factor, which may influence on
      quality of life and tolerance to the proposed treatment. The impairment of
      nutritional status during hematopoietic stem cell transplant occurs mainly due to
      the adverse effects resulting from conditioning to which the patient is
      subjected. Therefore, adequate nutritional evaluation and follow-up during
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant are essential. To emphasize the importance of 
      nutritional status and body composition during treatment, as well as the main
      characteristics related to the nutritional assessment of the patient, the
      Brazilian Consensus on Nutrition in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant: Adults
      was prepared, aiming to standardize and update Nutritional Therapy in this area. 
      Dietitians, nutrition physicians and hematologists from 15 Brazilian centers thar
      are references in hematopoietic stem cell transplant took part.

TI  - “My life is under control with these medications”: an interpretative
      phenomenological analysis of managing chronic pain with opioids.
LID - 61
AB  - Background: The use of opioids to relieve chronic pain has increased during the
      last decades, but experiences of chronic opioid therapy (COT) (> 90 days) point
      at risks and loss of beneficial effects. Still, some patients report benefits
      from opioid medication, such as being able to stay at work. Guidelines for opioid
      use in chronic pain do not consider the individual experience of COT, including
      benefits and risks, making the first person perspective an important scientific
      component to explore. The aim of this study was to investigate the lived
      experience of managing chronic pain with opioids in a sample who have severe
      chronic pain but are able to manage their pain sufficiently to remain at work.
      Methods: We used a qualitative research design: interpretative phenomenological
      analysis. Ten individuals with chronic pain and opioid therapy were purposively
      sampled in Swedish tertiary care. Results: Three super-ordinate themes emerged
      from the analyses: Without opioids, the pain becomes the boss; Opioids as a
      salvation and a curse, and Acknowledgement of the pain and acceptance of opioid
      therapy enables transition to a novel self. The participants used opioids to
      regain control over their pain, thus reclaiming their wanted life and self, and
      sense of control over one’s life-world. Using opioids to manage pain was not
      unproblematic and some of the participants had experienced a downward spiral of
      escalating pain and uncontrollable opioid use, and stigmatisation. Conclusions:
      All participants emphasised the importance of control, regarding both pain and
      opioid use. To accomplish this, trust between participants and health care
      providers was essential for satisfactory treatment. Regardless of the potential
      sociocultural benefits of staying at work, participants had experiences of
      balancing positive and negative effects of opioid therapy, similar to what
      previous qualitative research has found.Measurable improvement of function and
      quality of life, may justify the long-term use of opioids in some cases. However,
      monitoring of adverse events should be mandatory. This requires close cooperation
      and a trusting relationship between the patients and their health care provider.

TI  - Suicide among people treated for drug use disorders: a Danish national
      record-linkage study.
LID - 146
AB  - Background: Substance use disorders are a major risk factor for suicide. However,
      less is known about specific risk factors for suicide in people with substance
      use disorders. Methods: This population cohort study assessed suicide among
      people treated for drug use disorders in Denmark 2000–2010, and described risk
      factors for completed suicide. Data from 27,942 individuals enrolled in treatment
      were linked to national registers and matched with controls without drug use
      disorder and with (n = 138,136) or without psychiatric history (n = 1574).
      Competing risk regression was used to identify risk factors of completed suicide.
      Results: There were 163 suicides among patients with a history of drug treatment 
      (0.6% of patients). Increased risk was associated with younger age at enrolment
      (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 0.98), history of 
      psychiatric care (HR = 1.96, CI 95%: 1.39, 2.77), opioid use (HR = 1.81, 95% CI: 
      1.23, 2.68), and alcohol use (HR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.23). Lower risk was
      associated with cannabis use (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.96). Compared with age- 
      and gender-matched controls without a history of treatment for substance use
      disorders or recent psychiatric care, the standardized mortality ratio due to
      suicide was 7.13 for people with drug use disorder without a history of
      psychiatric care (95% CI: 5.81, 8.44), 13.48 for people with drug use disorder
      and psychiatric history (95% CI: 9.75, 17.22), and 13.61 for people with
      psychiatric history only (95% CI: 6.72, 20.50). Conclusions: Risk of suicide is
      increased among people with drug use disorders. Access to treatment for co-morbid
      mental health problems for people with drug use disorders could potentially
      reduce risk of suicide.

TI  - Stratified analyses of genome wide association study data reveal haplotypes for a
      candidate gene on chromosome 2 (KIAA1211L) is associated with opioid use in
      patients of Arabian descent.
LID - 41
AB  - Background: Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been conducted to
      identify genes and pathways involved in development of opioid use disorder. This 
      study extends the first GWAS of substance use disorder (SUD) patients from the
      United Arab Emirates (UAE) by stratifying the study group based on opioid use,
      which is the most common substance of use in this cohort. Methods: The GWAS
      cohort consisted of 512 (262 case, 250 controls) male participants from the UAE. 
      The samples were genotyped using the Illumina Omni5 Exome system. Data was
      stratified according to opioid use using PLINK. Haplotype analysis was conducted 
      using Haploview 4.2. Results: Two main associations were identified in this
      study. Firstly, two SNPs on chromosome 7 were associated with opioid use
      disorder, rs118129027 (p-value = 1.23 × 10 − 8) and rs74477937
      (p-value = 1.48 × 10 − 8). This has been reported in Alblooshi et al. (Am J Med
      Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet 180(1):68–79, 2019). Secondly, haplotypes on
      chromosome 2 which mapped to the KIAA1211L locus were identified in association
      with opioid use. Five SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (rs2280142,
      rs6542837, rs12712037, rs10175560, rs11900524) were arranged into haplotypes. Two
      haplotypes GAGCG and AGTTA were associated with opioid use disorders (p-value
      3.26 × 10− 8 and 7.16 × 10− 7, respectively). Conclusion: This is the first GWAS 
      to identify candidate genes associated with opioid use disorder in participants
      from the UAE. The lack of other genetic data of Arabian descent opioid use
      patients has hindered replication of the findings. Nevertheless, the outcomes
      implicate new pathways in opioid use disorder that requires further research to
      assess the role of the identified genes in the development of opioid use
      disorder.

TI  - Does early palliative identification improve the use of palliative care services?
LID - e0226597
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate whether the early identification of patients who may benefit
      from palliative care impacts on the use of palliative, community and acute-based 
      care services. Methods: Between 2014 and 2017, physicians from eight sites were
      encouraged to systematically identify patients who were likely to die within one 
      year and would were thought to benefit from early palliative care. Patients in
      the INTEGRATE Intervention Group were 1:1 matched to controls selected from
      provincial healthcare administrative data using propensity score-matching. The
      use of palliative care, community-based care services (home care, physician home 
      visit, and outpatient opioid use) and acute care (emergency department,
      hospitalization) was each evaluated within one year after the date of
      identification. The hazard ratio (HR) in the Intervention Group was calculated
      for each outcome. Results: Of the 1,185 patients in the Intervention Group, 951
      (80.3%) used palliative care services during follow-up, compared to 739 (62.4%)
      among 1,185 patients in the Control Group [HR of 1.69 (95% CI 1.56 to 1.82)]. The
      Intervention Group also had higher proportions of patients who used home care
      [81.4% vs. 55.2%; HR 2.07 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.27)], had physician home visits
      [35.5% vs. 23.7%; HR 1.63 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.92)] or had increased outpatient
      opioid use [64.3% vs. 52.1%); HR 1.43 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.57]. The Intervention
      Group was also more likely to have a hospitalization that was not primarily
      focused on palliative care (1.42 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.58)) and an unplanned
      emergency department visit for non-palliative care purpose (1.47 (95% CI 1.32 to 
      1.64)). Conclusion: Physicians actively identifying patients who would benefit
      from palliative care resulted in increased use of palliative and community-based 
      care services, but also increased use of acute care services.

TI  - The National Ambulance Surveillance System: A novel method for monitoring acute
      alcohol, illicit and pharmaceutical drug related-harms using coded Australian
      ambulance clinical records.
LID - e0228316
AB  - Although harmful consumption of alcohol and other drugs (both illicit and
      pharmaceutical) significantly contribute to global burden of disease, not all
      harms are captured within existing morbidity data sources. Indeed, harms
      occurring in the community may be missed or under-reported. This paper describes 
      the National Ambulance Surveillance System, a unique Australian system for
      monitoring and mapping acute harms related to alcohol and other drug consumption.
      Data are sourced from paramedic electronic patient care records provided by
      ambulance services from across Australia. Coding occurs in a purpose-built
      system, by a team of specialised research assistants. Alcohol, and specific
      illicit and pharmaceutical drugs, rather than broad drug classes, are manually
      coded and the dataset is reviewed and cleaned prior to analysis. The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an ongoing, dynamic surveillance system of
      alcohol and other drug-related harms across Australia. The data includes more
      than 140 output variables per attendance, including individual substances,
      demographics, temporal, geospatial, and clinical data (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale
      score, naloxone provision and response, outcome of attendance). The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an internationally unique population-level
      surveillance system of acute harms arising from alcohol and other drug
      consumption. Dissemination of National Ambulance Surveillance System data has
      been used to inform and evaluate policy approaches and potential points of
      intervention, as well as guide workforce development needs and clinical practice 
      at the local and national level. This methodology could be replicated in other
      countries.

TI  - Sex- and Gender-Based Analysis in Cannabis Treatment Outcomes: A Systematic
      Review.
LID - 872
AB  - There is evidence that sex- and gender-related factors are involved in cannabis
      patterns of use, health effects and biological mechanisms. Women and men report
      different cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptoms, with women reporting worse
      withdrawal symptoms than men. The objective of this systematic review was to
      examine the effectiveness of cannabis pharmacological interventions for women and
      men and the uptake of sex- and gender-based analysis in the included studies. Two
      reviewers performed the full-paper screening, and data was extracted by one
      researcher. The search yielded 6098 unique records—of which, 68 were full-paper
      screened. Four articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. From the
      randomized clinical studies of pharmacological interventions, few studies report 
      sex-disaggregated outcomes for women and men. Despite emergent evidence showing
      the influence of sex and gender factors in cannabis research, sex-disaggregated
      outcomes in pharmacological interventions is lacking. Sex- and gender-based
      analysis is incipient in the included articles. Future research should explore
      more comprehensive inclusion of sex- and gender-related aspects in
      pharmacological treatments for CUD.

TI  - Desmetramadol Is Identified as a G-Protein Biased µ Opioid Receptor Agonist.
LID - 1680
AB  - Tramadol is widely used globally and is the second most prescribed opioid in the 
      United States. It treats moderate to severe pain but lethal opioid-induced
      respiratory depression is uncommon even in large overdose. It is unknown why
      tramadol spares respiration. Here we show its active metabolite, desmetramadol,
      is as effective as morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl in eliciting G protein
      coupling at the human µ opioid receptor (MOR), but surprisingly, supratherapeutic
      concentrations spare human MOR-mediated βarrestin2 recruitment thought to mediate
      lethal opioid-induced respiratory depression.

TI  - Cannabis and Pain Treatment—A Review of the Clinical Utility and a Practical
      Approach in Light of Uncertainty.
LID - e0002
AB  - Over the past decade the phenomenon of cannabis as a legitimate form of treatment
      for pain has overwhelmed the medical community, especially in the field of pain. 
      From a status of a schedule 1 substance having no currently accepted medical use 
      and being considered to have high potential for abuse, its use has mushroomed to 
      over 50,000 legal medical users per year in Israel alone. There appear to be many
      reasons behind this phenomenon—medical, sociological, and economical. Thus, what 
      is cannabis? An abusive substance or a medication? Should it be incorporated into
      current biomedical practice, and how should it be administered? Finally, what is 
      the evidence for the beneficial and detrimental effects of cannabis? This article
      reviews and discusses the current literature regarding the beneficial and the
      detrimental effects of medical cannabis in the treatment of pain. We further
      discuss the problems and challenges facing the medical community in this domain
      and offer a practical approach to deal with these challenges.

TI  - Spinal versus General Anesthesia for Patients with Parkinson’s Disease.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - Background: Anesthesiologists prefer using general anesthesia (GA) in Parkinson’s
      disease (PD). However, GA may mask neurological symptoms in the intraoperative
      period and exacerbate them postoperatively. Furthermore, the anesthetics used in 
      GA have clear interactions with the drugs used to control PD. On the other hand, 
      drugs used in spinal anesthesia (SA) might be safer for patients with PD. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the effect of SA and GA in patients with PD who
      underwent hip fracture repairs. Methods: Retrospectively, we identified those
      patients with PD who were admitted due to hip joint fracture. The following
      information were obtained: demographics, preoperative assessment information of
      the patients, type of anesthesia, and types of fractures and orthopedic
      procedures. In addition, intraoperative and postoperative complications were
      studied. The patients were divided based on the type of anesthesia received and
      were compared. Results: Ten (8 males) patients with PD who underwent hip fracture
      surgery included in the study. Six patients received SA and 4 patients received
      GA. The mean age was 73.2 years. The preoperative assessment was not significant 
      for all patients. Postoperatively, within the inpatient period, 3 out of 4
      patients received GA developed complications (two atelectasis and urinary tract
      infection) while no patient developed complication from the SA group.
      Postoperative outpatient complications within one-month included 3 out of 4 cases
      in the GA group and only one complication in the SA group. The mean
      hospitalization period was 9 days for patients received GA and 5.8 days for
      patients received SA. Conclusion: This study reported less perioperative
      complications in the SA. Accordingly, further investigations and rp-randomized
      controlled trials evaluating various anesthetic techniques or drugs are needed.

TI  - Impact of a low FODMAP diet on the amount of rectal gas and rectal volume during 
      radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer – a prospective pilot study.
LID - 27
AB  - Background: Small inter- and intrafractional prostate motion was shown to be a
      prerequisite for precise radiotherapy (RT) of prostate cancer (PCa) to achieve
      good local control and low rectal toxicity. As rectal gas and rectal volume are
      known to have a relevant effect on prostate motion, this study aims to reduce
      these parameters by using a Low FODMAP Diet (LFD) and to show feasibility of this
      intervention. Methods: We compared a prospective intervention group (IG, n = 25) 
      which underwent RT for PCa and whose patients were asked to follow a LFD during
      RT with a retrospective control group (CG, n = 25) which did not get any dietary 
      advice. In the planning CT scan and all available cone beam CT scans rectal gas
      was classified based on a semiquantitative score (scale from 1 to 5) and rectal
      volume was measured. Furthermore, patients’ compliance was evaluated by a
      self-assessment questionnaire. Results: Clinical and treatment characteristics
      were well balanced between both groups. A total of 266 (CG, 10.6 per patient) and
      280 CT scans (IG, 11.2 per patient), respectively, were analysed. The frequency
      distribution of gas scores differed significantly from each other (p < .001) with
      the IG having lower scores. Rectal volume was smaller in the IG (64.28 cm3, 95%
      CI 60.92–67.65 cm3, SD 28.64 cm3) than in the CG (71.40 cm3, 95% CI
      66.47–76.32 cm3, SD 40.80 cm3) (p = .02). Mean intrapatient standard deviation as
      a measure for the variability of rectal volume was 22 cm3 in the IG and 23 cm3 in
      the CG (p = .81). Patients’ compliance and contentment were satisfying.
      Conclusions: The use of a LFD significantly decreased rectal gas and rectal
      volume. LFD was feasible with an excellent patients’ compliance. However,
      prospective trials with a larger number of patients and a standardized evaluation
      of gastrointestinal toxicity and quality of life are reasonable. Trial

TI  - Health-related quality of life in adolescents with persistent pain and the
      mediating role of self-efficacy: a cross-sectional study.
LID - 19
AB  - Background: Persistent pain has a high prevalence among adolescents. Pain has
      been shown to reduce all aspects of the adolescent’s health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL). In adult patients with pain, self-efficacy has been shown to
      mediate the relationship between pain intensity, disability and depression.
      However, little is known about whether self-efficacy acts as a mediating variable
      in the relationship between persistent pain and HRQOL sub-scale scores in a
      school-based population of adolescents. Objectives: To describe the experience of
      pain, HRQOL and self-efficacy, and to explore the association between pain
      intensity, general self-efficacy and HRQOL in adolescents with persistent pain by
      testing self-efficacy as a possible mediator. Methods: The study participants
      were 78 adolescents with persistent pain, aged 16–19 years, who were recruited
      from five high schools in southern Norway. All participants completed an
      electronic survey consisting of the Lubeck Pain Questionnaire, which included a
      visual analogue scale (VAS) measuring pain intensity, the General Self-Efficacy
      Scale (GSE) and the KIDSCREEN-52 Questionnaire measuring HRQOL. Statistical
      analyses were conducted using the PROCESS macro for SPSS developed by Andrew
      Hayes. Results: All participants reported pain in multiple locations, of which
      the head was most common (88.5%). Mean (SD) pain intensity score of the
      participants was 5.4 (1.8). The study sample had poor HRQOL, with mean (SD)
      scores for several sub-scales ranging from 45.2 (21.0) to 91.0 (13.3) on a 0–100 
      scale. The associations between pain intensity and the HRQOL sub-scales of
      physical well-being, psychological well-being, mood, self-perception, autonomy
      and school environment were mediated by self-efficacy. The highest degree of
      mediation and, thus, the largest indirect effect was estimated for the HRQOL
      sub-scale physical well-being (67.2%). Conclusions: This school-based sample of
      adolescents with persistent pain had impaired HRQOL. Up to 67% of the reduction
      in the HRQOL sub-scale scores for physical well-being, psychological well-being, 
      mood, self-perception, autonomy and school environment could be explained by the 
      mediating variable self-efficacy. Thus, future pain-management interventions that
      aim to increase HRQOL in school-based populations of adolescents with persistent 
      pain should consider promoting self-efficacy and providing more targeted
      interventions. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03551977.

TI  - Randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-centre study to assess the
      efficacy, tolerability and safety of Enterosgel® in the treatment of irritable
      bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) in adults.
LID - 122
AB  - Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a common and
      chronic condition that can significantly impair quality of life. The emergence of
      new drugs for IBS-D has been slow and there is a need for new treatments,
      including drug-free treatments, which are easy to use and suitable for different 
      patient groups. Currently available drug-free treatments include Enterosgel®, an 
      intestinal adsorbent approved for use in IBS-D and acute diarrhoea and available 
      over-the-counter in the UK and 30 countries worldwide. The aim of this
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study is to test the
      efficacy and safety of Enterosgel® compared to placebo in symptomatic treatment
      in IBS-D. Methods/design: We will recruit 430 participants with IBS-D from
      approximately 30 primary and secondary care sites in England. Participants
      meeting the required abdominal pain and stool consistency criteria over a 2-week 
      screening period will be randomly allocated to receive blinded treatment
      (Enterosgel® or placebo) for 8 weeks. This will be followed by an 8-week
      open-label treatment phase with Enterosgel®. Participants will be allowed to
      adjust their daily dosage during both phases based on their symptoms.
      Participants will then return to standard care and those who responded to
      treatment will receive a follow-up call 8 weeks later. Co-medication with
      loperamide will be permitted and use recorded. The primary outcome measure is the
      percentage of participants defined as responders for abdominal pain and stool
      consistency during at least 4 weeks in the 8-week blinded phase. Secondary
      outcome measures include stool frequency, stool consistency, abdominal pain,
      bloating, urgency, adequate relief, questionnaire scores and rescue medication
      use. Exploratory outcomes will be assessed in subsets of participants including
      qualitative and quantitative data on faecal microorganisms and biomarkers and
      gut-related measurements from magnetic resonance imaging data. Discussion: This
      is the first large scale randomised controlled trial investigating Enterosgel® in
      IBS-D. A study design with blinded phase followed by an open-label phase was
      chosen to encourage participation and study completion. Demonstrating that
      Enterosgel® is effective and safe in IBS-D could encourage adoption by patients
      and healthcare professionals and foster future clinical trials assessing its use 
      in related conditions. Trial registration: ISRCTN17149988. Prospectively

TI  - Multi-region assessment of pharmaceutical exposures and predicted effects in USA 
      wadeable urban-gradient streams.
LID - e0228214
AB  - Human-use pharmaceuticals in urban streams link aquatic-ecosystem health to human
      health. Pharmaceutical mixtures have been widely reported in larger streams due
      to historical emphasis on wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) sources, with limited
      investigation of pharmaceutical exposures and potential effects in smaller
      headwater streams. In 2014–2017, the United States Geological Survey measured 111
      pharmaceutical compounds in 308 headwater streams (261 urban-gradient sites
      sampled 3–5 times, 47 putative low-impact sites sampled once) in 4 regions across
      the US. Simultaneous exposures to multiple pharmaceutical compounds
      (pharmaceutical mixtures) were observed in 91% of streams (248 urban-gradient, 32
      low-impact), with 88 analytes detected across all sites and cumulative maximum
      concentrations up to 36,142 ng/L per site. Cumulative detections and
      concentrations correlated to urban land use and presence/absence of permitted
      WWTP discharges, but pharmaceutical mixtures also were common in the 75% of
      sampled streams without WWTP. Cumulative exposure-activity ratios (EAR) indicated
      widespread transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to
      vertebrates. Considering the potential individual and interactive effects of the 
      detected pharmaceuticals and the recognized analytical underestimation of the
      pharmaceutical-contaminant (unassessed parent compounds, metabolites, degradates)
      space, these results demonstrate a nation-wide environmental concern and the need
      for watershed-scale mitigation of in-stream pharmaceutical contamination.

TI  - Nonunion – consensus from the 4th annual meeting of the Danish Orthopaedic Trauma
      Society.
PG  - 46-57
AB  - Nonunions are a relevant economic burden affecting about 1.9% of all fractures.
      Rather than specifying a certain time frame, a nonunion is better defined as a
      fracture that will not heal without further intervention.Successful fracture
      healing depends on local biology, biomechanics and a variety of systemic factors.
      All components can principally be decisive and determine the classification of
      atrophic, oligotrophic or hypertrophic nonunions. Treatment prioritizes mechanics
      before biology.The degree of motion between fracture parts is the key for healing
      and is described by strain theory. If the change of length at a given load is >
      10%, fibrous tissue and not bone is formed. Therefore, simple fractures require
      absolute and complex fractures relative stability.The main characteristics of a
      nonunion are pain while weight bearing, and persistent fracture lines on
      X-ray.Treatment concepts such as ‘mechanobiology’ or the ‘diamond concept’
      determine the applied osteosynthesis considering soft tissue, local biology and
      stability. Fine wire circular external fixation is considered the only form of
      true biologic fixation due to its ability to eliminate parasitic motions while
      maintaining load-dependent axial stiffness. Nailing provides intramedullary
      stability and biology via reaming. Plates are successful when complex fractures
      turn into simple nonunions demanding absolute stability. Despite available
      alternatives, autograft is the gold standard for providing osteoinductive and
      osteoconductive stimuli.The infected nonunion remains a challenge. Bacteria,
      especially staphylococcus species, have developed mechanisms to survive such as
      biofilm formation, inactive forms and internalization. Therefore, radical
      debridement and specific antibiotics are necessary prior to reconstruction.Cite

TI  - Responses to addiction help-seeking from Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana, 
      and Bixby intelligent virtual assistants.
LID - 11
AB  - We investigated how intelligent virtual assistants (IVA), including Amazon’s
      Alexa, Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Samsung’s Bixby, 
      responded to addiction help-seeking queries. We recorded if IVAs provided a
      singular response and if so, did they link users to treatment or treatment
      referral services. Only 4 of the 70 help-seeking queries presented to the five
      IVAs returned singular responses, with the remainder prompting confusion (e.g.,
      “did I say something wrong?”). When asked “help me quit drugs” Alexa responded
      with a definition for the word drugs. “Help me quit…smoking” or “tobacco” on
      Google Assistant returned Dr. QuitNow (a cessation app), while on Siri “help me
      quit pot” promoted a marijuana retailer. IVAs should be revised to promote free, 
      remote, federally sponsored addiction services, such as SAMSHA’s 1-800-662-HELP
      helpline. This would benefit millions of IVA users now and more to come as IVAs
      displace existing information-seeking engines.

TI  - The identification of risk factors contributing to accidental opioid poisonings
      in companion dogs using data from a North American poison control center
      (2006-2014).
LID - e0227701
AB  - In the last decade, there has been a marked increase in opioid-related human
      deaths in the U.S. However, the effects of the growth in opioid use on vulnerable
      populations, such as pet dogs, are largely unknown. The objective of this study
      was to investigate potential risk factors at the dog, county, and state-levels
      that contributed to accidental dog opioid poisonings. Dog demographic information
      was collected during calls to the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC), operated
      by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, about pet dog
      exposures to poisons from 2006–2014. Data concerning state-level opioid-related
      human death rates and county-level human opioid prescription rates were collected
      from databases accessed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A
      multilevel logistic regression model with random intercepts for county and state 
      was fitted to explore associations between the odds of a call to the APCC being
      related to dog opioid poisonings with the following independent variables: sex,
      weight, age, reproductive status, breed class, year, source of calls,
      county-level human opioid prescription rate, and state-level opioid human death
      rate. There was a significant non-linear positive association between accidental 
      opioid dog poisoning calls and county-level human opioid prescription rates.
      Similarly, the odds of a call being related to an opioid poisoning significantly 
      declined over the study period. Depending on the breed class, the odds of a call 
      being related to an opioid poisoning event were generally lower for older and
      heavier dogs. The odds of a call being related to an opioid poisoning were
      significantly higher for intact compared to neutered dogs, and if the call was
      made by a veterinarian compared to a member of the public. Veterinarians
      responding to poisonings may benefit from knowledge of trends in the use and
      abuse of both legal and illegal drugs in human populations.

TI  - Cannabis Sativa Revisited—Crosstalk between microRNA Expression, Inflammation,
      Oxidative Stress, and Endocannabinoid Response System in Critically Ill Patients 
      with Sepsis.
LID - 307
AB  - Critically ill patients with sepsis require a multidisciplinary approach, as this
      situation implies multiorgan distress, with most of the bodily biochemical and
      cellular systems being affected by the condition. Moreover, sepsis is
      characterized by a multitude of biochemical interactions and by dynamic changes
      of the immune system. At the moment, there is a gap in our understanding of the
      cellular, genetic, and molecular mechanisms involved in sepsis. One of the
      systems intensely studied in recent years is the endocannabinoid signaling
      pathway, as light was shed over a series of important interactions of cannabinoid
      receptors with biochemical pathways, specifically for sepsis. Furthermore, a
      series of important implications on inflammation and the immune system that are
      induced by the activity of cannabinoid receptors stimulated by the
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) have been noticed.
      One of the most important is their ability to reduce the biosynthesis of
      pro-inflammatory mediators and the modulation of immune mechanisms. Different
      studies have reported that cannabinoids can reduce oxidative stress at
      mitochondrial and cellular levels. The aim of this review paper was to present,
      in detail, the important mechanisms modulated by the endocannabinoid signaling
      pathway, as well as of the molecular and cellular links it has with sepsis. At
      the same time, we wish to present the possible implications of cannabinoids in
      the most important biological pathways involved in sepsis, such as inflammation, 
      redox activity, immune system, and epigenetic expression.

TI  - A Census of Medicolegal Death Investigation in the United States: A Need to
      Determine the State of our Nation’s Toxicology Laboratories and Their
      Preparedness for the Current Drug Overdose Epidemic†, ‡.
PG  - 544-9
AB  - In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported on 2004 data collected from
      the Census of Medical Examiner and Coroner Offices (CMEC). The CMEC was one of
      the first comprehensive reports on the state of the medicolegal death
      investigation system in the United States and included information on
      administration, expenditure, workload, specialized death investigations, records 
      and evidence retention, and resources. However, the report did not include
      responses on questions that were related to toxicology such as specimen retention
      and type of testing. The purpose of this publication is to provide the community 
      with toxicology laboratory‐specific responses from nearly 2000 medical examiner
      and coroner (MEC) offices. Data obtained from a BJS CMEC public use dataset for
      any remaining information that was not reported in the 2007 BJS report were
      evaluated specific to the operation of toxicology laboratories within a MEC
      office or specific to toxicology testing. The CMEC includes information on
      average operating budget for MEC offices with internal or external toxicology
      services, budget for toxicology/microbiology services, respondents’ routine uses 
      of toxicology analysis, toxicology specimen retention time, average turnaround
      times, use of computerized information management systems, and participation in
      federal data collections. These historical data begin to address the present
      state of our nation’s toxicology laboratories within the medicolegal death
      investigation system and their preparedness for the current drug overdose
      epidemic.

TI  - Patient-Controlled Intravenous Morphine Analgesia Combined with Transcranial
      Direct Current Stimulation for Post-Thoracotomy Pain: A Cost-Effectiveness Study 
      and A Feasibility for Its Future Implementation.
LID - 816
AB  - This prospective randomized study aims to evaluate the feasibility and
      cost-effectiveness of combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      with patient controlled intravenous morphine analgesia (PCA-IV) as part of
      multimodal analgesia after thoracotomy. Patients assigned to the active treatment
      group (a-tDCS, n = 27) received tDCS over the left primary motor cortex for five 
      days, whereas patients assigned to the control group (sham-tDCS, n = 28) received
      sham tDCS stimulations. All patients received postoperative PCA-IV morphine. For 
      cost-effectiveness analysis we used data about total amount of PCA-IV morphine
      and maximum visual analog pain scale with cough (VASP-Cmax). Direct costs of
      hospitalization were assumed as equal for both groups. Cost-effectiveness
      analysis was performed with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER),
      expressed as the incremental cost (RSD or US$) per incremental gain in mm of
      VASP-Cmax reduction. Calculated ICER was 510.87 RSD per VASP-Cmax 1 mm reduction.
      Conversion on USA market (USA data 1.325 US$ for 1 mg of morphine) revealed ICER 
      of 189.08 US$ or 18960.39 RSD/1 VASP-Cmax 1 mm reduction. Cost-effectiveness
      expressed through ICER showed significant reduction of PCA-IV morphine costs in
      the tDCS group. Further investigation of tDCS benefits with regards to reduction 
      of postoperative pain treatment costs should also include the long-term benefits 
      of reduced morphine use.

TI  - Screening for depression among a sample of US college students who engage in
      recreational prescription opioid misuse.
PG  - 59-65
AB  - Background: Among student populations, literature has identified associations
      between prescription opioid misuse and symptoms of depression such as
      hopelessness, sadness, and emotional pain. Thus far, existing literature has yet 
      to investigate associations between prescription opioid misuse and depression
      using validated screening instruments for depression when exploring such
      associations. The purpose of this study was to utilize a validated screening tool
      to explore quantifiable presence of depression among college students who engage 
      in recreational prescription opioid misuse (RPOM). Additionally, gender
      differences in depression and co-occurring substance use are examined.Methods:
      Students (n = 104) of a large university in the Southeastern United States who
      reported ROM within the past 6 months completed instrumentation assessing
      demographics, substance use, as well as, screening tools for depression and
      possible opioid use disorder (OUD). Results: Positive depression screens were
      significantly higher among females, however, nearly56% of participants screened
      positive for major depression. Though high levels of co-occurring substance use
      were observed among the entire sample, males were significantly more likely to
      report cocaine use, more frequent use of alcohol and marijuana, as well as,
      exhibit a positive screen for disordered opioid use, at a rate 5 times that of
      their female counterparts. Conclusion: Students who engage in RPOM are a
      particularly heightened-risk subsample of the college population who exhibit high
      levels of depressive symptomatology and substance use behavior. Targeted
      programming and further investigations are needed among this specific population.
      Future studies are encouraged to utilize validated instruments when assessing
      depression among students.

      Suggestions.
PG  - 137-9
AB  - Prolonged and neglected use of an intravenous (IV) line could be limb- and
      life-threatening. In many terminally sick cancer patients of rural India, pain
      management is a major concern. It is a very common practice by local
      practitioners to give IV fluids and pain medications in such patients. Where IV
      access is difficult, a secure venous cannula is kept in situ for long periods to 
      administer pain medicines and fluids. This article tries to highlight the dangers
      a neglected IV line poses to limb and life and tries to stress on the importance 
      of a subcutaneous route for pain medication administration in terminally ill
      palliative patients.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Initiation of Strong Opioids in Cancer Patients on
      Palliative Care: An Audit from a Tertiary Cancer Center in India.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - Aim:: This audit was done to analyze the factors influencing the use of strong
      opioids in cancer patients receiving comprehensive palliative care from a
      tertiary institute. Materials and Methods:: Case records of patients registered
      for palliative care at our center in 3 months were retrospectively reviewed and
      followed up throughout the course of their illness. Demographic factors, prior
      treatments, social support system, analgesic use at registration, and use of
      radiation and adjuvant analgesics were recorded. Strong opioid use and their time
      of initiation were evaluated, and multivariate analysis was used to identify the 
      factors correlating with the above. Results:: After registration, strong opioids 
      were initiated in 16% of the patients. It was observed that patients younger than
      55 years and those with visceral metastases and history of use of weak opioids at
      the time of registration had a higher probability of being started on strong
      opioids. Factors associated with a significantly longer strong opioid-free
      interval were having spouse as primary caregiver, presence of skeletal
      metastases, use of palliative radiotherapy, and low socioeconomic status.
      Conclusion:: It is certain that the use of strong opioids for adequate analgesia 
      is a necessity for palliative-care patients. However, optimal utilization of
      adjunctive analgesic modalities, coupled with good supportive care, can minimize 
      the requirement and duration of strong opioid use, especially in developing
      countries with limited access to specialist palliative care.

      Management: A Pharmacogenomics Perspective.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - The global cancer burden is significantly increasing at an alarming rate
      affecting patients, relatives, communities, and health-care system. Cancer
      patients require adequate pain relief and palliative care throughout the life
      course, especially in terminal illness. Although opioid treatment is successful
      in majority of patients, around 40% do not achieve enough analgesia or are prone 
      to serious side effects and toxicity. The treatment of medical conditions with
      cannabis and cannabinoid compounds is constantly expanding. This review organizes
      the current knowledge in the context of SNPs associated with opioids and
      nonopioids and its clinical consequences in pain management and pharmacogenetic
      targets of cannabinoids, for use in clinical practice.

TI  - Activation of Melanocortin-4 Receptor Inhibits Both Neuroinflammation Induced by 
      Early Exposure to Ethanol and Subsequent Voluntary Alcohol Intake in Adulthood in
      Animal Models: Is BDNF the Key Mediator?
LID - 5
AB  - The concept that neuroinflammation induced by excessive alcohol intake in
      adolescence triggers brain mechanisms that perpetuate consumption has
      strengthened in recent years. The melanocortin system, composed of the
      melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and its ligand α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone
      (α-MSH), has been implicated both in modulation of alcohol consumption and in
      ethanol-induced neuroinflammation decrease. Chronic alcohol consumption in
      adolescent rats causes a decrease in an α-MSH release by the hypothalamus, while 
      the administration of synthetic agonists of MC4R causes a decrease in
      neuroinflammation and a decrease in voluntary alcohol consumption. However, the
      mechanism that connects the activation of MC4R with the decrease of both
      neuroinflammation and voluntary alcohol consumption has not been elucidated.
      Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in alcohol drinking 
      motivation, dependence and withdrawal, and its levels are reduced in alcoholics. 
      Deficiencies in BDNF levels increased ethanol self-administration in rats.
      Further, BDNF triggers important anti-inflammatory effects in the brain, and this
      could be one of the mechanisms by which BDNF reduces chronic alcohol intake.
      Interestingly, MC4R signaling induces BDNF expression through the activation of
      the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). We hypothesize that ethanol
      exposure during adolescence decreases the expression of α-MSH and hence MC4R
      signaling in the hippocampus, leading to a lower BDNF activity that causes
      dramatic changes in the brain (e.g., neuroinflammation and decreased
      neurogenesis) that predispose to maintain alcohol abuse until adulthood. The
      activation of MC4R either by α-MSH or by synthetic agonist peptides can induce
      the expression of BDNF, which would trigger several processes that lead to lower 
      alcohol consumption.

TI  - Effect of Morning Light Glasses and Night Short-Wavelength Filter Glasses on
      Sleep-Wake Rhythmicity in Medical Inpatients.
LID - 5
AB  - Sleep and circadian rhythm disorders are common amongst medical inpatients. They 
      are caused by a mixture of factors, including noise, loss of habitual daily
      routines, and abnormal exposure to light, which tends to be insufficient in the
      day and too high at night. The aim of the present study was to test the efficacy 
      of morning light therapy plus night short-wavelength filter glasses on sleep
      quality/timing, and sleepiness/mood over the daytime hours, in a group of
      well-characterized medical inpatients. Thirty-three inpatients were enrolled and 
      randomized (2:1) to either treatment (n = 22; 13 males, 48.3 ± 13.3 years) or
      standard of care (n = 11; 8 males, 56.9 ± 12.9 years). On admission, all
      underwent a baseline assessment of sleep quality/timing and diurnal preference.
      During hospitalization they underwent monitoring of sleep quality/timing (sleep
      diaries and actigraphy), plus hourly assessment of sleepiness/mood during the
      daytime hours on one, standard day of hospitalization. Patients in the treatment 
      arm were administered bright light through glasses immediately after awakening,
      and wore short-wavelength filter glasses in the evening hours. Treated and
      untreated patients were comparable in terms of demographics, disease
      severity/comorbidity, diurnal preference and pre-admission sleep quality/timing. 
      During hospitalization, sleep diaries documented a trend for a lower number of
      night awakenings in treated compared to untreated patients (1.6 ± 0.8 vs. 2.4 ±
      1.3, p = 0.057). Actigraphy documented significantly earlier day mode in treated 
      compared to untreated patients (06:39 ± 00:35 vs. 07:44 ± 00:40, p = 0.008).
      Sleepiness during a standard day of hospitalization, recorded between 09:30 and
      21:30, showed physiological variation in treated compared to untreated patients, 
      who exhibited a more blunted profile. The level of sleepiness reported by treated
      patients was lower over the 09:30–14:30 interval, i.e., soon after light
      administration (interaction effect: F = 2.661; p = 0.026). Mood levels were
      generally higher in treated patients, with statistically significant differences 
      over the 09:30–14:30 time interval, i.e., soon after light administration
      (treatment: F = 5.692, p = 0.026). In conclusion, treatment with morning bright
      light and short-wavelength filter glasses in the evening, which was well
      tolerated, showed positive results in terms of sleepiness/mood over the morning
      hours and a trend for decreased night awakenings.

TI  - Acid and inflammatory sensitisation of naked mole-rat colonic afferent nerves.
LID - 1744806920903150
AB  - Acid sensing in the gastrointestinal tract is required for gut homeostasis and
      the detection of tissue acidosis caused by ischaemia, inflammation and infection.
      In the colorectum, activation of colonic afferents by low pH contributes to
      visceral hypersensitivity and abdominal pain in human disease including during
      inflammatory bowel disease. The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) shows no
      pain-related behaviour to subcutaneous acid injection and cutaneous afferents are
      insensitive to acid, an adaptation thought to be a consequence of the
      subterranean, likely hypercapnic, environment in which it lives. As such we
      sought to investigate naked mole-rat interoception within the gastrointestinal
      tract and how this differed from the mouse (Mus Musculus). Here, we show the
      presence of calcitonin gene-related peptide expressing extrinsic nerve fibres
      innervating both mesenteric blood vessels and the myenteric plexi of the smooth
      muscle layers of the naked mole-rat colorectum. Using ex vivo colonic-nerve
      electrophysiological recordings, we show differential sensitivity of naked
      mole-rat, compared to mouse, colonic afferents to acid and the prototypic
      inflammatory mediator bradykinin, but not direct mechanical stimuli. In naked
      mole-rat, but not mouse, we observed mechanical hypersensitivity to acid, whilst 
      both species sensitised to bradykinin. Collectively, these findings suggest that 
      naked mole-rat colonic afferents are capable of detecting acidic stimuli;
      however, their intracellular coupling to downstream molecular effectors of
      neuronal excitability and mechanotransduction likely differs between species.

TI  - Measuring the placebo effect in carpal tunnel syndrome.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: The placebo effect can account for part of the improvement seen in
      patients undergoing any type of treatment, be it surgical or pharmacological. The
      objective of this study is to quantify the placebo effect in carpal tunnel
      syndrome treatment. Materials and methods: A double-blinded randomized trial was 
      performed with 68 patients suffering from mild to moderate carpal tunnel
      syndrome, divided into two groups with no statistically significant differences
      regarding age, weight, or degree of nerve compression. The patients were
      evaluated clinically and electromyographically before and after 2 months of
      treatment with either palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) or placebo. Results: The
      results, comparing the two groups, showed an improvement in both groups on a
      visual analogue scale (VAS) and Levine’s questionnaire, which have been reported 
      to show statistical differences in only a few items. In the placebo group, the
      mean age was 53.32 years (±13.43) and the BMI was 28.85 kg/m2 (±4.84). Before
      treatment, the average symptom severity score (SSS) on the Levine questionnaire
      was 2.57 (±0.74) and the functional status score (FSS) was 2.24 (±0.66). After
      treatment, these decreased to 2.11 (±0.81) and 1.96 (±0.77), being statistically 
      nonsignificant for SSS (p = 0.0865) but significant for FSS (p = 0.0028). VAS
      showed a statistically nonsignificant decrease from 4.06 to 3.25 (p = 0.3407).
      After placebo treatment, SSS, FSS, and VAS improved by 0.46, 0.28, and 0.81
      points or 17.89%, 12.5%, and 19.95%, respectively. Conclusions: These results
      show an improvement in the studied parameters by up to 20%, but when compared
      with those published in literature, these show great variability due to the wide 
      variety of factors involved in the placebo effect. Several factors that affect
      the placebo effect are discussed, and the present work tries to quantify it in
      carpal tunnel syndrome. Level of Evidence: Level 2 of evidence according to “The 
      Oxford 2011 Level of Evidence.”

TI  - Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine in preventing postoperative nausea and
      vomiting in pediatric patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - e0227904
AB  - Background: Intravenous lidocaine in adults undergoing general anesthesia has
      been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
      However, the anti-postoperative vomiting (POV) effect of lidocaine in pediatric
      patients remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with
      Trial Sequential Analysis to evaluate the effect of intravenous lidocaine on
      prevention of POV/PONV. Methods: Six databases including trial registration sites
      were searched. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the incidence of POV/PONV
      after intravenous lidocaine compared with control were included. The primary
      outcome was the incidence of POV within 24 hours after general anesthesia. The
      incidence of POV was combined as a risk ratio with 95% confidence interval using 
      a random-effect model. We used the I2 to assess heterogeneity. We evaluated the
      quality of trials using the Cochrane methodology, and we assessed quality of
      evidence using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and
      Evaluation approach. We also assessed adverse events. Results and discussion: Six
      trials with 849 patients were included, of whom 433 received intravenous
      lidocaine. Three trials evaluated the incidence of POV, and 3 evaluated the
      incidence of PONV. The overall incidence of POV within 24 hours after anesthesia 
      was 45.9% in the lidocaine group and 63.4% in the control group (risk ratio,
      0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–1.00; I2 = 32%; p = 0.05). The incidence of
      PONV within 24 hours after anesthesia was 3.73% in the lidocaine group and 4.87% 
      in the control group (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.36–1.59; I2 = 0%; p = 0.47). The
      quality of evidence was downgraded to “very low” due to the study designs,
      inconsistency, imprecision, and possible publication bias. Conclusion: Our
      meta-analysis suggests that intravenous lidocaine infusion may reduce the
      incidence of POV, however, the evidence quality was “very low.” Further trials
      with a low risk of bias are necessary.

TI  - Proteomic profiling of proteins in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in dairy
      cows with chronic lameness.
LID - e0228134
AB  - Chronic lameness affects bovine welfare and has a negative economic impact in
      dairy industry. Moreover, due to the translational gap between traditional pain
      models and new drugs development for treating chronic pain states, naturally
      occurring painful diseases could be a potential translational tool for chronic
      pain research. We therefore employed liquid chromatography tandem mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to stablish the proteomic profile of the spinal cord
      samples from lumbar segments (L2-L4) of chronic lame dairy cows. Data were
      validated and quantified through software tool (Scaffold® v 4.0) using output
      data from two search engines (SEQUEST® and X-Tandem®). Search Tool for the
      Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) analysis was performed to detect
      proteins interactions. LC-MS/MS identified a total amount of 177 proteins; of
      which 129 proteins were able to be quantified. Lame cows showed a strong
      upregulation of interacting proteins with chaperone and stress functions such as 
      Hsp70 (p < 0.006), Hsc70 (p < 0.0079), Hsp90 (p < 0.015), STIP (p > 0.0018) and
      Grp78 (p <0.0068), and interacting proteins associated to glycolytic pathway such
      as; γ-enolase (p < 0.0095), α-enolase (p < 0.013) and hexokinase-1 (p < 0.028).
      It was not possible to establish a clear network of interaction in several
      upregulated proteins in lame cows. Non-interacting proteins were mainly
      associated to redox process and cytoskeletal organization. The most relevant down
      regulated protein in lame cows was myelin basic protein (MBP) (p < 0.02). Chronic
      inflammatory lameness in cows is associated to increased expression of stress
      proteins with chaperone, metabolism, redox and structural functions. A state of
      endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) might explain
      the changes in protein expression in lame cows; however, further studies need to 
      be performed in order to confirm these findings.

TI  - Multicentre, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial of 10 khz
      high-frequency spinal cord stimulation for chronic neuropathic low back pain
      (MODULATE-LBP): a trial protocol.
LID - 111
AB  - Introduction: Chronic neuropathic low back pain (CNLBP) is a debilitating
      condition in which established medical treatments seldom alleviate symptoms.
      Evidence demonstrates that high-frequency 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
      reduces pain and improves health-related quality of life in patients with failed 
      back surgery syndrome (FBSS), but evidence of this effect is limited in
      individuals with CNLBP who have not had surgery. The aim of this multicentre
      randomised trial is to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 10 kHz SCS
      for this population. Methods: This is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised,
      sham-controlled trial with a parallel economic evaluation. A total of 96 patients
      with CNLBP who have not had spinal surgery will be implanted with an epidural
      lead and a sham lead outside the epidural space without a screening trial.
      Patients will be randomised 1:1 to 10 kHz SCS plus usual care (intervention
      group) or to sham 10 kHz SCS plus usual care (control group) after receiving the 
      full implant. The SCS devices will be programmed identically using a cathodal
      cascade. Participants will use their handheld programmer to alter the intensity
      of the stimulation as per routine practice. The primary outcome will be a 7-day
      daily pain diary. Secondary outcomes include the Oswestry Disability Index,
      complications, EQ-5D-5 L, and health and social care costs. Outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline (pre-randomisation) and at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months
      after device activation. The primary analyses will compare primary and secondary 
      outcomes between groups at 6 months, while adjusting for baseline outcome scores.
      Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) will be calculated at 6
      months and over the lifetime of the patient. Discussion: The outcomes of this
      trial will inform clinical practice and healthcare policy on the role of
      high-frequency 10 kHz SCS for use in patients with CNLBP who have not had
      surgery. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03470766. Registered on 20

TI  - A Collaborative Medication Review Including Deprescribing for Older Patients in
      an Emergency Department: A Longitudinal Feasibility Study.
LID - 348
AB  - Medication review for older patients with polypharmacy in the emergency
      department (ED) is crucial to prevent inappropriate prescribing. Our objective
      was to assess the feasibility of a collaborative medication review in older
      medical patients (≥65 years) using polypharmacy (≥5 long-term medications). A
      pharmacist performed the medication review using the tools: Screening Tool of
      Older Persons’ potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria, a
      drug–drug interaction database (SFINX), and Renbase® (renal dosing database). A
      geriatrician received the medication review and decided which recommendations
      should be implemented. The outcomes were: differences in Medication
      Appropriateness Index (MAI) and Assessment of Underutilization Index (AOU) scores
      between admission and 30 days after discharge and the percentage of patients for 
      which the intervention was completed before discharge. Sixty patients were
      included from the ED, the intervention was completed before discharge for 50
      patients (83%), and 39 (61.5% male; median age 80 years) completed the follow-up 
      30 days after discharge. The median MAI score decreased from 14 (IQR 8-20) at
      admission to 8 (IQR 2-13) 30 days after discharge (p < 0.001). The number of
      patients with an AOU score ≥1 was reduced from 36% to 10% (p < 0.001). Thirty
      days after discharge, 83% of the changes were sustained and for 28 patients
      (72%), 1≥ medication had been deprescribed. In conclusion, a collaborative
      medication review and deprescribing intervention is feasible to perform in the
      ED.

      different extents of inverse agonism.
LID - e52189
AB  - By analyzing and simulating inactive conformations of the highly homologous
      dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R), we find that eticlopride binds D2R in
      a pose very similar to that in the D3R/eticlopride structure but incompatible
      with the D2R/risperidone structure. In addition, risperidone occupies a
      sub-pocket near the Na+ binding site, whereas eticlopride does not. Based on
      these findings and our experimental results, we propose that the divergent
      receptor conformations stabilized by Na+-sensitive eticlopride and
      Na+-insensitive risperidone correspond to different degrees of inverse agonism.
      Moreover, our simulations reveal that the extracellular loops are highly dynamic,
      with spontaneous transitions of extracellular loop 2 from the helical
      conformation in the D2R/risperidone structure to an extended conformation similar
      to that in the D3R/eticlopride structure. Our results reveal previously
      unappreciated diversity and dynamics in the inactive conformations of D2R. These 
      findings are critical for rational drug discovery, as limiting a virtual screen
      to a single conformation will miss relevant ligands.

TI  - Video Game Addiction and Emotional States: Possible Confusion Between Pleasure
      and Happiness?
LID - 2894
AB  - Internet gaming disorder is characterized by a severely reduced control over
      gaming, resulting in an increasing gaming time and leading to negative
      consequences in many aspects of the individual life: personal, family, social,
      occupational and other relevant areas of functioning (World Health Organization).
      In the last years, the significant boom in using video games has been raising
      health issues that remain insufficiently understood. The extent of this
      phenomenon (the estimated prevalence is between 1.7 and 10% of the general
      population) has led the mentioned Organization to include gaming disorders in the
      list of mental health conditions (2018). Several studies show converging findings
      that highlight the common brain activities between substance use disorders and
      behavioral addictions (i.e., gaming disorders). Addiction specialists observed
      that addict subjects tend to confuse pleasure with happiness when linking
      emotional states to their addictive activities. As far as we know, beyond the
      mentioned observations, distinguishing the perception of these two emotional
      states in the frame of an addiction has not been yet the object of formal
      research. This study aims at examining the possible confusion between pleasure
      and happiness within the addiction sphere. Video game addiction has been chosen
      to explore the possible occurrence of this perceptional distortion. A mixed
      design lab-based study was carried out to compare between video games addicts and
      non-addicts (between-subjects), and video games-related activities and neutral
      activities (within-subject). Emotional reactions were gauged by self-reported
      scales and physiological data acquired through a range of biosensors: Relaxation 
      and Hearth Rate. From a therapeutic standpoint, this research intends to explore 
      alternatives to deal with this sort of disorders. More specifically, at the
      cognitive level, the idea is elaborating guidelines to develop patients’ insights
      into these emotional states and thus increasing their ability to handle them.
      Overall, several indices resulting from this study constitute a bundle of
      arguments that argue in favor of the confusion between pleasure and happiness
      made by addict users when associating their affective states to video gaming.
      Furthermore, this approach illustrates how reappraising emotions may contribute
      to reducing the perceptional distortion of these emotional states.

TI  - Optogenetic mapping of feeding and self-stimulation within the lateral
      hypothalamus of the rat.
LID - e0224301
AB  - The lateral hypothalamus (LH) includes several anatomical subregions involved in 
      eating and reward motivation. This study explored localization of function across
      different LH subregions in controlling food intake stimulated by optogenetic
      channelrhodopsin excitation, and in supporting laser self-stimulation. We
      particularly compared the tuberal LH subregion, the posterior LH subregion, and
      the lateral preoptic area. Local diameters of tissue optogenetically stimulated
      within the LH were assessed by measuring laser-induced Fos plumes and Jun plumes 
      via immunofluorescence surrounding optic fiber tips. Those plume diameters were
      used to map localization of function for behavioral effects elicited by LH
      optogenetic stimulation. Optogenetic stimulation of the tuberal subsection of the
      LH produced the most robust eating behavior and food intake initially, but
      produced only mild laser self-stimulation in the same rats. However, after
      repeated exposures to optogenetic stimulation, tuberal LH behavioral profiles
      shifted toward more self-stimulation and less food intake. By contrast,
      stimulation of the lateral preoptic area produced relatively little food intake
      or self-stimulation, either initially or after extended stimulation experience.
      Stimulation in the posterior LH subregion supported moderate self-stimulation,
      but not food intake, and at higher laser intensity shifted valence to evoke
      escape behaviors. We conclude that the tuberal LH subregion may best mediate
      stimulation-bound increases in food intake stimulated by optogenetic excitation. 
      However, incentive motivational effects of tuberal LH stimulation may shift
      toward self-stimulation behavior after repeated stimulation. By contrast, the
      lateral preoptic area and posterior LH do not as readily elicit either eating
      behavior or laser self-stimulation, and may be more prone to higher-intensity
      aversive effects.

TI  - Improving opioid guideline adherence: evaluation of a multifaceted,
      theory-informed pilot intervention for family physicians.
LID - e032167
AB  - Objectives: Opioid-related deaths continue to increase in North America, an
      epidemic that was initiated by high rates of opioid prescribing. We designed a
      multifaceted, theory-informed Opioid Self-Assessment (OSA) package, to increase
      adherence to the Canadian Opioid Guideline among family physicians. This study
      aimed to assess changes in Canadian family physicians’ knowledge and practices
      after completing the OSA package. Design: We conducted a mixed-method evaluation 
      using a pre-test and post-test design that involved the collection of both
      qualitative and quantitative data. Setting: This research was conducted in the
      primary care setting in Ontario, Canada. Participants: We recruited a purposive
      sample of nine family physicians in Ontario who use long-term opioid therapy to
      treat patients with chronic pain. Interventions: The OSA package included four
      components: an online knowledge test, an online learning programme, a safe
      medication practice self-assessment questionnaire and chart audit with feedback. 
      Outcome measures: Our measures included changes in knowledge, opioid safety
      practices and physicians’ perspectives on the OSA package. Results: We found
      statistically significant improvements between pre-test and post-test knowledge
      scores at both baseline and 6-month follow-up. Physicians’ scores improved
      significantly on five of the seven core characteristics of the practice
      self-assessment questionnaire. On the chart audits, we observed an improvement in
      patient education between baseline and 6 months. Qualitative interviews showed
      that participants appreciated embedded resources in the OSA package. The
      completion of the package stimulated identification of gaps or deficits in
      practice and served as a useful reminder to discuss risk and safety with
      patients. Participants described the chart review as helpful in prompting
      discussions with their patients, identifying deficits and strengths and a
      ‘primary motivator’ for project participation. Conclusions: The OSA package has
      the potential to improve medication safety practices in primary care related to
      opioid monitoring and adherence to current opioid guidelines.

TI  - Awareness during emergence from anesthesia: Features and future research
      directions.
PG  - 245-54
AB  - The anesthesia awareness with recall (AAWR) phenomenon represents a complication 
      of general anesthesia consisting of memorization of intraoperative events
      reported by the patient immediately after the end of surgery or at a variable
      distance from it. Approximately 20% of AAWR cases occur during emergence from
      anesthesia. Clinically, these unexpected experiences are often associated with
      distress especially due to a sense of paralysis. Indeed, although AAWR at the
      emergence has multiple causes, in the majority of cases the complication develops
      when the anesthesia plan is too early lightened at the end of anesthesia and
      there is a lack of use, or misuse, of neuromuscular monitoring with improper
      management of the neuromuscular block. Because the distress caused by the sense
      of paralysis represents an important predictor for the development of severe
      psychological complications, the knowledge of the phenomenon, and the possible
      strategies for its prophylaxis are aspects of considerable importance.
      Nevertheless, a limited percentage of episodes of AAWR cannot be prevented. This 
      paradox holds also during the emergence phase of anesthesia which represents a
      very complex neurophysiological process with many aspects yet to be clarified.

TI  - Trigeminal neuralgia: An overview from pathophysiology to pharmacological
      treatments.
LID - 1744806920901890
AB  - The trigeminal nerve (V) is the fifth and largest of all cranial nerves, and it
      is responsible for detecting sensory stimuli that arise from the craniofacial
      area. The nerve is divided into three branches: ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), 
      and mandibular (V3); their cell bodies are located in the trigeminal ganglia and 
      they make connections with second-order neurons in the trigeminal brainstem
      sensory nuclear complex. Ascending projections via the trigeminothalamic tract
      transmit information to the thalamus and other brain regions responsible for
      interpreting sensory information. One of the most common forms of craniofacial
      pain is trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by sudden,
      brief, and excruciating facial pain attacks in one or more of the V branches,
      leading to a severe reduction in the quality of life of affected patients.
      Trigeminal neuralgia etiology can be classified into idiopathic, classic, and
      secondary. Classic trigeminal neuralgia is associated with neurovascular
      compression in the trigeminal root entry zone, which can lead to demyelination
      and a dysregulation of voltage-gated sodium channel expression in the membrane.
      These alterations may be responsible for pain attacks in trigeminal neuralgia
      patients. The antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are the
      first-line pharmacological treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. Their mechanism of
      action is a modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a decrease in
      neuronal activity. Although carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are the first-line
      treatment, other drugs may be useful for pain control in trigeminal neuralgia.
      Among them, the anticonvulsants gabapentin, pregabalin, lamotrigine and
      phenytoin, baclofen, and botulinum toxin type A can be coadministered with
      carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine for a synergistic approach. New pharmacological
      alternatives are being explored such as the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine,
      eslicarbazepine, and the new Nav1.7 blocker vixotrigine. The pharmacological
      profiles of these drugs are addressed in this review.

TI  - Transdiagnostic or Disorder Specific? Indicators of Substance and Behavioral
      Addictions Nominated by People with Lived Experience.
LID - 334
AB  - Using a transdiagnostic perspective, the present research examined the prominent 
      indicators of substance (alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, tobacco) and behavioral
      (gambling, video games, sex, shopping, work, eating) addictions nominated by
      people with lived experiences. Specifically, we aimed to explore whether the
      perceived most important indicators nominated were consistent across the 10
      addictions or differed based on the specific addiction. Additionally, we explored
      gender differences in the perceived most important indicators across addictive
      behaviors. A large online sample of adults recruited from a Canadian province (n 
      = 3503) were asked to describe the most important signs or symptoms of problems
      with these substances and behaviors. Open-ended responses were analyzed among a
      subsample of 2603 respondents (n = 1562 in the past year) who disclosed that they
      had personally experienced a problem with at least one addiction listed above.
      Content analyses revealed that dependence (e.g., craving, impairments in control)
      and patterns of use (e.g., frequency) were the most commonly perceived indicators
      for both substance and behavioral addictions, accounting for over half of all the
      qualitative responses. Differences were also found between substance and
      behavioral addictions regarding the proportion of the most important signs
      nominated. Consistent with the syndrome model of addiction, unique indicators
      were also found for specific addictive behaviors, with the greatest proportion of
      unique indicators found for eating. Supplemental analyses found that perceived
      indicators across addictions were generally gender invariant. Results provide
      some support for a transdiagnostic conceptualization of substance and behavioral 
      addictions. Implications for the study, prevention, and treatment of addictions
      are discussed.

TI  - G protein‐biased kratom‐alkaloids and synthetic carfentanil‐amide opioids as
      potential treatments for alcohol use disorder.
PG  - 1497-513
AB  - Background and Purpose: Mitragyna speciosa, more commonly known as kratom, is a
      plant that contains opioidergic alkaloids but is unregulated in most countries.
      Kratom is used in the self‐medication of chronic pain and to reduce illicit and
      prescription opioid dependence. Kratom may be less dangerous than typical opioids
      because of the stronger preference of kratom alkaloids to induce receptor
      interaction with G proteins over β‐arrestin proteins. We hypothesized that kratom
      (alkaloids) can also reduce alcohol intake. Experimental Approach: We
      pharmacologically characterized kratom extracts, kratom alkaloids (mitragynine,
      7‐hydroxymitragynine, paynantheine, and speciogynine) and synthetic
      carfentanil‐amide opioids for their ability to interact with G proteins and
      β‐arrestin at μ, δ, and κ opioid receptors in vitro. We used C57BL/6 mice to
      assess to which degree these opioids could reduce alcohol intake and whether they
      had rewarding properties. Key Results: Kratom alkaloids were strongly G
      protein‐biased at all three opioid receptors and reduced alcohol intake, but
      kratom and 7‐hydroxymitragynine were rewarding. Several results indicated a key
      role for δ opioid receptors, including that the synthetic carfentanil‐amide
      opioid MP102—a G protein‐biased agonist with modest selectivity for δ opioid
      receptors—reduced alcohol intake, whereas the G protein‐biased μ opioid agonist
      TRV130 did not. Conclusion and Implications: Our results suggest that kratom
      extracts can decrease alcohol intake but still carry significant risk upon
      prolonged use. Development of more δ opioid‐selective synthetic opioids may
      provide a safer option than kratom to treat alcohol use disorder with fewer side 
      effects.

TI  - Clinicians Beware, Ewing’s Sarcoma After 60 Is Elusive and Rare!
LID - e6768
AB  - Ewing’s sarcoma is the second most common malignant bone tumor in children, with 
      the worst outcomes seen in patients over the age of 20. However, the onset of the
      disease is much less common in people over the age of 30. This case represents
      the diagnostic dilemma posed by an otherwise “straight forward” case of back
      pain. Keeping the differential diagnosis sufficiently broad to include bone
      malignancies, so as not to delay diagnosis and treatment, provides the best
      chance at a positive outcome.

TI  - Effectiveness of supervised early exercise program in patients with arthroscopic 
      rotator cuff repair: Study protocol clinical trial.
LID - e18846
AB  - Background:: Based on the available evidence, it is difficult to make a clinical 
      decision about the best exercise program and to establish the most favorable time
      to start postoperative treatment after rotator cuff (RC) repair. The aim of this 
      trial is to evaluate the effects of adding a supervised early exercise program to
      standard treatment for functional improvement and pain relief compared with
      standard treatment alone in patients with arthroscopic RC repair. Method/design::
      A total of 118 patients between the ages of 18 and 50 years with arthroscopic RC 
      repair will be randomized to 2 treatment arms. The control group will receive a
      standard exercise program based on a consensus statement on shoulder
      rehabilitation developed by the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow
      Therapists. The intervention group will receive a supervised early exercise
      program in combination with standard treatment. This supervised exercise program 
      will be based on electromyographic evidence. Three evaluations will be performed:
      before surgery, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be 
      the shoulder function by the Constant–Murley questionnaire, and the secondary
      outcome measures will be the upper limb function by the disabilities of the arm, 
      shoulder, and hand questionnaire; pain by the visual analog scale; and the
      shoulder range of motion by a goniometer. Discussion:: We hypothesize that
      patients who receive a supervised early exercise program in combination with
      standard treatment will benefit more in respect to shoulder function, pain
      reduction, and range of motion than those who receive a standard exercise
      program. If this is confirmed, our study can be used clinically to enhance the
      recovery of patients with arthroscopic RC repair. Trial registration:: Brazilian 
      registry of clinical trials UTN number U1111-1224-4143. Registered December 18,
      2018.

TI  - Characteristics of Patients Referred To A Specialized Headache Clinic.
LID - 1146
AB  - Headache is a common problem with great effect both on the individual and on the 
      society. Recent studies raised the possibility of increasing rate of specialty
      referrals, inappropiate treatment and advanced imaging for simple headache. The
      aim of our study was to analyze the characteritics of patients (including
      duration of symptoms, headache type, brain imaging, treatment) referred to our
      specialized headache clinic between 01/01/2014 and 01/01/2015 by their general
      practitioners and primary care neurologists due to chronic/treatment-resistant
      headache syndromes. 202 patients (mean age 53.6 ± 17.6 years) were evaluated in
      our clinic (102 females, mean age 50.14 ± 16.11 years and 100 males, mean age
      57 ± 18.1 years). Migraine (84/202) and tension-type (76/202) were the most
      common syndromes. 202 plain brain CT, 60 contrast-enhanced CT and 128 MRI were
      carried out by their general practitioners or other healthcare professioners
      including neurologists before referral to our headache centre. Despite of
      extensive brain imaging appropiate treatment was started less than 1/3 of all
      patients and significant proportion received benzodiazepines or opioid therapy.
      Furthermore, more than 10% of referred patients presented with secondary headache
      including one meningitis. The management of headache is still a challenge for
      primary care physicians leading to medical overuse. Vast majority of our patients
      should not be referred to our specialized headache clinic as they had
      uncomplicated headache or other underlying conditions than pain.

TI  - Drivers of the opioid crisis: An appraisal of financial conflicts of interest in 
      clinical practice guideline panels at the peak of opioid prescribing.
LID - e0227045
AB  - Background: Starting in the late 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry sought to
      increase prescribing of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Influencing the
      content of clinical practice guidelines may have been one strategy industry
      employed. In this study we assessed potential risk of bias from financial
      conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry in guidelines for opioid
      prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain published between 2007 and 2013, the peak
      of opioid prescribing. Methods: We used the Guideline Panel Review (GPR) to
      appraise the guidelines included in the 2014 systematic review and critical
      appraisal by Nuckols et al. These were English language opioid prescribing
      guidelines for adults with chronic non-cancer pain published between July 2007
      and July 2013, the peak of opioid prescribing. The GPR assigns red flags to items
      known to introduce potential bias from financial conflicts of interest. We
      operationalized the GPR by creating specific definitions for each red flag. Two
      reviewers independently evaluated each guideline. Disagreements were resolved
      with discussion. We also compared our score to the critical appraisal scores for 
      overall quality from the study by Nuckols et al. Results: We appraised 13
      guidelines, which received 43 red flags in total. Guidelines had 3.3 red flags on
      average (out of a possible seven) with range from one to six. Four guidelines had
      missing information, so red flags may be higher than reported. The guidelines
      with the highest and second highest scores for overall quality in the 2014
      critical appraisal by Nuckols et al. had five and three red flags, respectively. 
      Conclusion: Our findings reveal that the guidelines for opioid prescribing
      chronic non-cancer pain from 2007 to 2013 were at risk of bias because of
      pervasive conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry and a paucity of
      mechanisms to address bias. Even highly-rated guidelines examined in a 2014
      systematic review and critical appraisal had many red flags.

TI  - 1-1-8 one-step sevoflurane wash-in scheme for low-flow anesthesia: simple, rapid,
      and predictable induction.
LID - 23
AB  - Background: Sevoflurane is suitable for low-flow anesthesia (LFA). LFA needs a
      wash-in phase. The reported sevoflurane wash-in schemes lack simplicity, target
      coverage, and applicability. We proposed a one-step 1-1-8 wash-in scheme for
      sevoflurane LFA to be used with both N2O and Air. The objective of our study was 
      to identify time for achieving each level of alveolar concentration of
      sevoflurane (FAS) from 1 to 3.5% in both contexts. Methods: We recruited 199
      adults requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and controlled
      ventilation—102 in group N2O and 97 in group Air. After induction and intubation,
      a wash-in was started using a fresh gas flow of O2:N2O or O2:Air at 1:1 L·min− 1 
      plus sevoflurane 8%. The ventilation was controlled to maintain end-tidal CO2 of 
      30–35 mmHg. Results: The rising patterns of FAS and inspired concentration of
      sevoflurane (FIS) are similar, running parallel between the groups. The FAS/FIS
      ratio increased from 0.46 to 0.72 within 260 s in group N2O and from 0.42 to 0.69
      within 286 s in group Air. The respective time to achieve an FAS of 1, 1.5, 2,
      2.5, 3, and 3.5% was 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 3.5, and 4.5 min in group N2O and 1, 1.5, 2,
      3, 4, and 5 min in group Air. The heart rate and blood pressure of both groups
      significantly increased initially then gradually decreased as FAS increased.
      Conclusions: The 1-1-8 wash-in scheme for sevoflurane LFA has many advantages,
      including simplicity, coverage, swiftness, safety, economy, and that it can be
      used with both N2O and Air. A respective FAS of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5% when 
      used with N2O and Air can be expected at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 3.5, and 4.5 min and 1,
      1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min. Trial registration: This study was retrospectively
      registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03510013) on June 8, 2018.

      disabilities and ADHD.
LID - 212601
AB  - Background: We evaluated Gamalate® B6 (GB6) in patients with borderline
      intellectual functioning (BIF) or mild intellectual development disability (IDD).
      Patients and methods: This was a prospective phase IV observational pilot study
      in 30 patients who underwent neuropsychological evaluation during treatment with 
      GB6 for 12 weeks. Results: In comparison with baseline, the responses were
      positive, with a significant improvement in hyperactivity (51.7%), irritability
      (35.5%), and logorrhea (50%), and no sedative effect. The Clinical Global
      Impressions – Severity (CGI-S) score was much improved or very much improved in
      73% of cases. Reaction time was better with fewer errors, thus indicating an
      improvement in attentional processes. A statistically significant result was
      obtained for the number of movements used to solve the problem and for the total 
      number of correctly solved problems. Conclusion: In this pilot study, GB6 was
      effective and well tolerated in cases of ADHD and challenging behavior in young
      adults with borderline-to-mild BIF/IDD. However, given the small number of
      patients involved and the uncontrolled nature of the study, these results should 
      be viewed cautiously.

TI  - Virtual Reality Analgesia With Interactive Eye Tracking During Brief Thermal Pain
      Stimuli: A Randomized Controlled Trial (Crossover Design).
LID - 467
AB  - In light of growing concerns about opioid analgesics, developing new
      non-pharmacologic pain control techniques has become a high priority. Adjunctive 
      virtual reality can help reduce acute pain during painful medical procedures.
      However, for some especially painful medical procedures such as burn wound
      cleaning, clinical researchers recommend that more distracting versions of
      virtual reality are needed, to further amplify the potency of virtual reality
      analgesia. The current study with healthy volunteers explores for the first time 
      whether interacting with virtual objects in Virtual Reality (VR) via “hands free”
      eye-tracking technology integrated into the VR helmet makes VR more
      effective/powerful than non-interactive/passive VR (no eye-tracking) for reducing
      pain during brief thermal pain stimuli.Method: Forty eight healthy volunteers
      participated in the main study. Using a within-subject design, each participant
      received one brief thermal pain stimulus during interactive eye tracked virtual
      reality, and each participant received another thermal pain stimulus during
      non-interactive VR (treatment order randomized). After each pain stimulus,
      participants provided subjective 0–10 ratings of cognitive, sensory and affective
      components of pain, and rated the amount of fun they had during the pain
      stimulus. Results: As predicted, interactive eye tracking increased the analgesic
      effectiveness of immersive virtual reality. Compared to the passive
      non-interactive VR condition, during the interactive eye tracked VR condition,
      participants reported significant reductions in worst pain (p < 0.001) and pain
      unpleasantness (p < 0.001). Participants reported a significantly stronger
      illusion of presence (p < 0.001), and significantly more fun in VR (p < 0.001)
      during the interactive condition compared to during passive VR. In summary, as
      predicted by our primary hypothesis, in the current laboratory acute pain analog 
      study with healthy volunteers, increasing the immersiveness of the VR system via 
      interactive eye tracking significantly increased how effectively VR reduced worst
      pain during a brief thermal pain stimulus. Although attention was not directly
      measured, the pattern of pain ratings, presence ratings, and fun ratings are
      consistent with an attentional mechanism for how VR reduces pain. Whether the
      current results generalize to clinical patient populations is another important
      topic for future research. Additional research and development is recommended.

TI  - Heterogeneity in the distribution of 159 drug-response related SNPs in world
      populations and their genetic relatedness.
LID - e0228000
AB  - Interethnic variability in drug response arises from genetic differences
      associated with drug metabolism, action and transport. These genetic variations
      can affect drug efficacy as well as cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We
      retrieved drug-response related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated
      data from databases and analyzed to elucidate population specific distribution of
      159 drug-response related SNPs in twenty six populations belonging to five
      super-populations (African, Admixed Americans, East Asian, European and South
      Asian). Significant interpopulation differences exist in the minor (variant)
      allele frequencies (MAFs), linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype
      distributions among these populations. 65 of the drug-response related alleles,
      which are considered as minor (variant) in global population, are present as the 
      major alleles (frequency ≥0.5) in at least one or more populations. Populations
      that belong to the same super-population have similar distribution pattern for
      majority of the variant alleles. These drug response related variant allele
      frequencies and their pairwise LD measure (r2) can clearly distinguish the
      populations in a way that correspond to the known evolutionary history of human
      and current geographic distributions, while D' cannot. The data presented here
      may aid in identifying drugs that are more appropriate and/or require
      pharmacogenetic testing in these populations. Our findings emphasize on the
      importance of distinct, ethnicity-specific clinical guidelines, especially for
      the African populations, to avoid ADRs and ensure effective drug treatment.

TI  - Persisting Reductions in Cannabis, Opioid, and Stimulant Misuse After
      Naturalistic Psychedelic Use: An Online Survey.
LID - 955
AB  - Background: Observational data and preliminary studies suggest serotonin 2A
      agonist psychedelics may hold potential in treating a variety of substance use
      disorders (SUDs), including opioid use disorder (OUD). Aims: The study aim was to
      describe and analyze self-reported cases in which naturalistic psychedelic use
      was followed by cessation or reduction in other substance use. Methods: An
      anonymous online survey of individuals reporting cessation or reduction in
      cannabis, opioid, or stimulant use following psychedelic use in non-clinical
      settings. Results: Four hundred forty-four respondents, mostly in the USA (67%)
      completed the survey. Participants reported 4.5 years of problematic substance
      use on average before the psychedelic experience to which they attributed a
      reduction in drug consumption, with 79% meeting retrospective criteria for severe
      SUD. Most reported taking a moderate or high dose of LSD (43%) or
      psilocybin-containing mushrooms (29%), followed by significant reduction in drug 
      consumption. Before the psychedelic experience 96% met SUD criteria, whereas only
      27% met SUD criteria afterward. Participants rated their psychedelic experience
      as highly meaningful and insightful, with 28% endorsing psychedelic-associated
      changes in life priorities or values as facilitating reduced substance misuse.
      Greater psychedelic dose, insight, mystical-type effects, and personal meaning of
      experiences were associated with greater reduction in drug consumption.
      Conclusions: While these cross-sectional and self-report methods cannot determine
      whether psychedelics caused changes in drug use, results suggest the potential
      that psychedelics cause reductions in problematic substance use, and support
      additional clinical research on psychedelic-assisted treatment for SUD.

TI  - Optogenetic Activation of β-Endorphin Terminals in the Medial Preoptic Nucleus
      Regulates Female Sexual Receptivity.
LID - ENEURO.0315-19.2019
AB  - Estrogen and progesterone (P4) act in neural circuits to elicit lordosis, the
      stereotypical female sexual receptivity behavior. Estradiol acts through membrane
      receptors to rapidly activate a limbic-hypothalamic circuit consisting of the
      arcuate (ARH), medial preoptic (MPN), and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei of the
      hypothalamus. This initial activation results in a transient but necessary
      inhibition of lordosis, which appears to be a result of the release of
      β-endorphin (β-End) from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) terminals onto cells
      containing the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) in the MPN. To functionally examine the
      role of the MOR in the hypothalamic lordosis circuit, we transfected a
      channelrhodopsin (ChR2) adeno-associated virus into POMC cell bodies in the ARH
      and photostimulated POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN in sexually receptive
      female Pomc-cre mice. Following estrogen and P4 priming, sexual receptivity was
      assessed by measuring the lordosis quotient (LQ). Following an initial trial for 
      sexual receptivity, mice were photostimulated during behavioral testing, and
      brains were processed for MOR immunohistochemistry (IHC). Photostimulation
      decreased the LQ only in ChR2-expressing Pomc-cre mice. Furthermore,
      photostimulation of ChR2 in POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN resulted in the 
      internalization of MOR, indicating activation of the receptor. Our results
      suggest that the activation of the MOR in the MPN is sufficient to attenuate
      lordosis behavior in a hormone-primed, sexually receptive female mouse. These
      data support a central role of MOR in female sexual behavior, and provide further
      insight into the hypothalamus control of sexual receptivity.

TI  - Intrinsic sensory disinhibition contributes to intrusive re-experiencing in
      combat veterans.
LID - 936
AB  - Intrusive re-experiencing of traumatic events is a hallmark symptom of
      posttraumatic stress disorder, characterized by rich and vivid sensory details as
      reported in “flashbacks”. While prevailing models of trauma intrusions focus on
      dysregulated emotional processes, we hypothesize that a deficiency in intrinsic
      sensory inhibition could drive overactivation of sensory representations of
      trauma memories, precipitating sensory-rich intrusions. In a sample of combat
      veterans, we examined resting-state alpha (8–12 Hz) oscillatory activity (in both
      power and posterior→frontal connectivity), given its role in sensory cortical
      inhibition, in association with intrusive re-experiencing symptoms. Veterans
      further participated in an odor task (including both combat and non-combat odors)
      to assess olfactory trauma memory and emotional response. We observed an
      association between intrusive re-experiencing symptoms and attenuated
      resting-state posterior→frontal alpha connectivity, which were both correlated
      with olfactory trauma memory. Importantly, olfactory trauma memory was identified
      as a mediator of the relationship between alpha connectivity and intrusive
      re-experiencing, suggesting that deficits in intrinsic sensory inhibition
      contributed to intrusive re-experiencing of trauma via heightened trauma memory. 
      Therefore, by permitting unfiltered sensory cues to enter information processing 
      and activate sensory representations of trauma, sensory disinhibition can
      constitute a sensory mechanism of intrusive re-experiencing in trauma-exposed
      individuals.

AB  - So far, opioids have been successfully used to reduce cancer pain in patients in 
      order to improve their quality of life. However, the use of opioids leads to
      numerous side effects such as constipation, drowsiness, nausea, itching,
      increased sweating and hormonal changes. In this review, we described the action 
      of opioids in several molecular pathways significant for maintenance of the
      intestinal homeostasis including the impact on the intestinal epithelium
      integrity, changes in microbiome composition, modulation of the immune system or 
      induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. We summed up the role of
      individual opioids in the processes involved in the growth and development of
      cancer and elucidated if targeting opioid receptors may constitute novel
      therapeutic option in colon cancer.

TI  - Therapeutic Use of LSD in Psychiatry: A Systematic Review of
      Randomized-Controlled Clinical Trials.
LID - 943
AB  - Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was studied from the 1950s to the 1970s to
      evaluate behavioral and personality changes, as well as remission of psychiatric 
      symptoms in various disorders. LSD was used in the treatment of anxiety,
      depression, psychosomatic diseases and addiction. However, most of the studies
      were not performed under contemporary standards, and it has taken several decades
      for a resurgence of interest in LSD research and its therapeutic potential for
      psychiatry. The aim of this review is to identify controlled and randomized
      clinical trials that assess the potential use of LSD in psychiatry. PRISMA
      guidelines for systematic review were followed. A literature search of PubMed and
      Psychedelic bibliography from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic
      Studies (MAPS) databases was performed as well as a manual search of references
      from evaluated studies. Only randomized-controlled clinical trials were included.
      Study quality was systematically calculated by using the Cochrane Collaboration
      Tool for assessing risk of bias. A final selection of 11 articles was made after 
      considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. LSD was administered to 567
      patients in a dose ranging from 20 to 800 mcg. Despite the design heterogeneity
      of clinical trials, positive results were observed, thus revealing the
      therapeutic potential of LSD to reduce psychiatric symptomatology, mainly in
      alcoholism. The vast majority of authors describe significant and positive
      short-term changes in patients, despite the fact that in some studies an
      important homogenization was observed between the LSD treatment group and control
      group at long-term follow-up. Multiple variables regarding LSD treatment
      therapeutic approach and quality of experience were revealed and related to
      therapeutic outcomes. LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in
      psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment
      of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing proper double blind clinical
      trials with this substance, new studies that conform to modern standards are
      necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge on its use and open new doors in
      the future.

TI  - Safety, Tolerability, and Effect on Opioid Use of Meloxicam IV Following
      Orthopedic Surgery.
PG  - 221-9
AB  - Objective: A Phase 3 randomized multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial (NCT02720692) compared once-daily intravenous (IV) meloxicam 30 mg to
      placebo, when added to the standard of care pain management regimens, in adults
      with moderate-to-severe pain following major elective surgery and concluded that 
      meloxicam IV had a safety profile similar to placebo and reduced opioid
      consumption. Methods: In this post hoc subgroup analysis of orthopedic surgery
      subjects, 379 subjects received meloxicam IV 30 mg or IV-administered placebo
      every 24 hrs for ≤7 doses. Safety was assessed via AEs, laboratory tests, vital
      signs, and ECG, with an emphasis on specific AEs, including injection site
      reactions, bleeding, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, thrombotic, and wound
      healing events. Daily opioid consumption was assessed during treatment. Results: 
      Among meloxicam IV-treated subjects, 64.7% experienced ≥1 AE versus 68.8% of
      placebo-treated subjects. Investigators assessed most AEs to be mild or moderate 
      in intensity and unrelated to treatment. Total opioid consumption (36.8 mg versus
      50.3 mg IV morphine equivalent dose; P=0.0081) and opioid consumption during time
      points 0‒24, 24‒48, 0‒48, and 0‒72 hrs were statistically significantly lower in 
      the meloxicam IV group. Conclusion: Meloxicam IV demonstrated no significant
      differences in the number and frequency of AEs versus placebo in subjects
      following orthopedic surgery. Opioid consumption was reduced in the meloxicam IV 
      group versus placebo. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier:
      NCT02720692).

TI  - Prostanoid receptor genes confer poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma via epigenetic inactivation.
LID - 31
AB  - Background: Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC) and other diseases. Prostanoid receptors are clearly involved
      in the development of many types of cancer. However, their role is not simple and
      is poorly understood in HNSCC. Methods: Methylation profiles of prostanoid
      receptor family genes were generated for tumour samples obtained from 274
      patients with HNSCC, including 69 hypopharynx, 51 larynx, 79 oral cavity, and 75 
      oropharynx tumour samples, by quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Promoter
      methylation was then evaluated with respect to various clinical characteristics
      and patient survival. Results: The mean number of methylated genes per sample was
      2.05 ± 2.59 (range 0 to 9). Promoters of PTGDR1, PTGDR2, PTGER1, PTGER2, PTGER3, 
      PTGER4, PTGFR, PTGIR, and TBXA2R were methylated in 43.8%, 18.2%, 25.5%, 17.5%,
      41.2%, 8.0%, 19.3%, 20.4%, and 11.3% of the samples, respectively. Methylation
      indices for prostanoid receptor family genes tended to be higher as the number of
      TET methylation events increased. Patients with 5–9 methylated genes had a
      significantly lower survival rate than that of patients with 0–4 methylated genes
      (log-rank test, P= 0.007). In multivariate analyses, PTGDR1 methylation was most 
      highly correlated with recurrence in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer
      (P = 0.014). A similar correlation was observed for PTGER4 in patients with
      laryngeal cancer (P = 0.046). Methylation of the PTGIR and TBXA2R promoters was
      positively correlated with recurrence in oropharyngeal cancer (P = 0.028 and
      P = 0.006, respectively). Moreover, Patients with 5–9 methylated genes were
      extremely lower of 5hmC levels (P = 0.035) and was correlated with increasing
      expression of DNMT3A and DNMT3B (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively).
      Conclusion: We characterised the relationship between the methylation status of
      prostanoid receptor genes and recurrence in HNSCC. These results provide new
      perspectives for the development of molecular targeted treatment approaches.

TI  - A retrospective analysis of NIH-funded digital health research using social media
      platforms.
LID - 2055207619901085
AB  - Objective: Social network platforms are increasingly used in digital health
      research. Our study aimed to 1. qualify and quantify the use of social media
      platforms in health research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
      and document changes occurring between 2011 and 2017 and 2. examine whether
      institutions hosting these studies provided public-facing guidelines on how to
      conduct ethical social media health research. Methods: The NIH RePORTER (Research
      Portfolio Online Reporting Tools) database was searched to identify research
      utilizing Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, or Twitter. Studies included used
      social media for observational research, recruitment, intervention delivery or to
      assess social media as an effective research tool. Abstracts were qualitatively
      analyzed to describe the population and health topic by year. Websites of
      organizations receiving funding for this research were searched to identify
      whether guidance or policy existed. Results: Studies (n = 105) were organized by 
      population targeted and health focus. Main “Health” themes were labeled: 1.
      substance use, 2. disease/diagnosis, 3. psychiatry/mental health, and 4. weight
      and physical activity. The populations most involved included adolescents and
      young adults, and men who have sex with men. The number of research studies using
      social media increased approximately 590% between 2011 and 2017. Studies were
      linked to 56 organizations of which 21% (n = 12) provided some accessible
      guidance with 79% (n = 44) offering no guidance specific to social media health
      research. Conclusions: Social media research is conducted with vulnerable
      populations that are traditionally difficult to reach. There is a compelling need
      for resources designed to support ethical and responsible social media-enabled
      research to enable this research to be carried out safely.

TI  - Interventions for incarcerated adults with opioid use disorder in the United
      States: A systematic review with a focus on social determinants of health.
LID - e0227968
AB  - Incarceration poses significant health risks for people involved in the criminal 
      justice system. As the world’s leader in incarceration, the United States
      incarcerated population is at higher risk for infectious diseases, mental
      illness, and substance use disorder. Previous studies indicate that the mortality
      rate for people coming out of prison is almost 13 times higher than that of the
      general population; opioids contribute to nearly 1 in 8 post-release fatalities
      overall, and almost half of all overdose deaths. Given the hazardous intersection
      of incarceration, opioid use disorder, and social determinants of health, we
      systematically reviewed recent evidence on interventions for opioid use disorder 
      (OUD) implemented as part of United States criminal justice system involvement,
      with an emphasis on social determinants of health (SDOH). We searched academic
      literature to identify eligible studies of an intervention for OUD that was
      implemented in the context of criminal justice system involvement (e.g.,
      incarceration or parole/probation) for adults ages 19 and older. From 6,604
      citations, 13 publications were included in final synthesis. Most interventions
      were implemented in prisons (n = 6 interventions), used medication interventions 
      (n = 10), and did not include SDOH as part of the study design (n = 8).
      Interventions that initiated medication treatment early and throughout
      incarceration had significant, positive effects on opioid use outcomes. Evidence 
      supports medication treatment administered throughout the period of criminal
      justice involvement as an effective method of improving post-release outcomes in 
      individuals with criminal justice involvement. While few studies included SDOH
      components, many investigators recognized SDOH needs as competing priorities
      among justice-involved individuals. This review suggests an evidence gap;
      evidence-based interventions that address OUD and SDOH in the context of criminal
      justice involvement are urgently needed.

TI  - The Role of Peripheral Opioid Receptors in Triggering Heroin-induced Brain
      Hypoxia.
LID - 833
AB  - While it is known that opioid receptors (ORs) are densely expressed in both the
      brain and periphery, it is widely accepted that hypoxic effects of opioids result
      solely from their direct action in the CNS. To examine the role of peripheral ORs
      in triggering brain hypoxia, we used oxygen sensors in freely moving rats to
      examine how naloxone-HCl and naloxone-methiodide, the latter which is commonly
      believed to be peripherally restricted, affect brain oxygen responses induced by 
      intravenous heroin at low, human-relevant doses. Similar to naloxone-HCl,
      naloxone-methiodide at a relatively low dose (2 mg/kg) fully blocked
      heroin-induced decreases in brain oxygen levels. As measured by mass
      spectrometry, naloxone-methiodide was found to be ~40-fold less permeable than
      naloxone-HCl across the blood-brain barrier, thus acting as a selective blocker
      of peripheral ORs. Despite this selectivity, a low but detectable amount of
      naloxone was found in brain tissue after naloxone-methiodide administration,
      potentially influencing our results. Therefore, we examined the effects of
      naloxone-methiodide at a very low dose (0.2 mg/kg; at which naloxone was
      undetectable in brain tissue) and found that this drug still powerfully
      attenuates heroin-induced brain oxygen responses. These data demonstrate the role
      of peripheral ORs in triggering heroin-induced respiratory depression and
      subsequent brain hypoxia.

TI  - Epidemiology of knee osteoarthritis in general practice: a registry-based study.
LID - e031734
AB  - Objectives: The present study investigated (1) trends in the prevalence and
      incidence of knee osteoarthritis over a 20-year period (1996–2015); (2) trends in
      multimorbidity and (3) trends in drug prescriptions. Design: Registry-based
      study. Setting: Primary healthcare, Flanders, Belgium. Participants: Data were
      collected from Intego, a general practice-based morbidity registration network.
      In the study period between 1996 and 2015, data from 440 140 unique patients were
      available. Outcome measures: Trends in prevalence and incidence rate of knee
      osteoarthritis were computed using joinpoint regression analysis. The mean
      disease count was calculated to assess trends in multimorbidity. In addition, the
      number of drug prescriptions was identified by the Anatomical Therapeutic
      Chemical Classification code and trends were equally recorded with joinpoint
      regression. Results: The total age-standardised prevalence of knee osteoarthritis
      increased from 2.0% in 1996 to 3.6% in 2015. An upward trend was observed with an
      average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 2.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 2.9). In 2015, the 
      prevalence rates in the 10 year age groups from the 45–54 years age group onwards
      were 3.1%, 5.6%, 9.0% and 13.9%, to reach 15.0% in people aged 85 years and
      older. The incidence remained stable with 3.75‰ in 2015 (AAPC=−0.5, 95% CI −1.4
      to 0.5). The mean disease count significantly increased from 1.63 to 2.34
      (p<0.001) for incident cases with knee osteoarthritis. Finally, we observed a
      significantly positive trend in the overall prescription of acetaminophen
      (AAPC=6.7, 95% CI 5.6 to 7.7), weak opioids (AAPC=4.0, 95% CI 0.9 to 7.3) and
      glucosamine (AAPC=8.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 15.1). Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs were most prescribed, with a prevalence rate of 29.8% in 2015, but remained
      stable during the study period (AAPC=0.0, 95% CI −1.1 to 1.1). Conclusions:
      Increased prevalence, multimorbidity, and number of drug prescriptions confirm an
      increased burden of knee osteoarthritis. In future, these trends can be used to
      prioritise initiatives for improvement in care.

TI  - Allosteric Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1) Ligands Reduce Ocular Pain and
      Inflammation.
LID - 417
AB  - Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) activation has been reported to reduce transient
      receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1)-induced
      inflammatory responses and is anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory in corneal
      injury. We examined whether allosteric ligands, can modulate CB1 signaling to
      reduce pain and inflammation in corneal hyperalgesia. Corneal hyperalgesia was
      generated by chemical cauterization of cornea in wildtype and CB2 knockout
      (CB2−/−) mice. The novel racemic CB1 allosteric ligand GAT211 and its enantiomers
      GAT228 and GAT229 were examined alone or in combination with the orthosteric CB1 
      agonist Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8-THC). Pain responses were assessed following 
      capsaicin (1 µM) stimulation of injured corneas at 6 h post-cauterization.
      Corneal neutrophil infiltration was also analyzed. GAT228, but not GAT229 or
      GAT211, reduced pain scores in response to capsaicin stimulation. Combination
      treatments of 0.5% GAT229 or 1% GAT211 with subthreshold Δ8-THC (0.4%)
      significantly reduced pain scores following capsaicin stimulation. The
      anti-nociceptive effects of both GAT229 and GAT228 were blocked with CB1
      antagonist AM251, but remained unaffected in CB2−/− mice. Two percent GAT228, or 
      the combination of 0.2% Δ8-THC with 0.5% GAT229 also significantly reduced
      corneal inflammation. CB1 allosteric ligands could offer a novel approach for
      treating corneal pain and inflammation.

TI  - New drugs are not enough-drug repositioning in oncology: An update.
PG  - 651-84
AB  - Drug repositioning refers to the concept of discovering novel clinical benefits
      of drugs that are already known for use treating other diseases. The advantages
      of this are that several important drug characteristics are already established
      (including efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity), making the
      process of research for a putative drug quicker and less costly. Drug
      repositioning in oncology has received extensive focus. The present review
      summarizes the most prominent examples of drug repositioning for the treatment of
      cancer, taking into consideration their primary use, proposed anticancer
      mechanisms and current development status.

TI  - Immersive virtual reality as analgesia for women during hysterosalpingography:
      study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 102
AB  - Background: Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is an accepted radiologic diagnostic
      modality for initial infertility workup, and is generally considered
      uncomfortable and painful. However, the management of pain related to HSG remains
      inefficient. As an emerging nonpharmacologic and noninvasive pain control
      strategy, virtual reality (VR) distraction has been successfully used in areas
      such as burns, blunt force trauma, hospital-based needle procedures,
      dental/periodontal procedures, and urological endoscopy patients. This study aims
      to evaluate the analgesic effect of VR during HSG. Methods/design: A
      single-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial will be carried out in
      the Radiology Department of Yinchuan Women and Children Healthcare Hospital,
      Yinchuan. A total of 200 participants who are scheduled for HSG will be enrolled 
      in this study. The participants will be randomized (1:1) into two groups: a VR
      group and a blank control group. The VR group will receive routine care plus
      immersive VR intervention and the blank control group will receive routine care. 
      Outcomes will be monitored at baseline, immediately after HSG and 15 min after
      HSG for each group. The primary outcome is the worst pain score during HSG by a
      visual analog scale (VAS). The secondary outcomes include: affective pain,
      cognitive pain, and anxiety during the HSG procedure; worst pain within 15 min
      after HSG; patient satisfaction and acceptance with pain management;
      physiological parameters; adverse effects; HSG results; and immersion perception 
      score of the VR system (for the VR condition only). Discussion: This study will
      focus on exploring a simply operated, noninvasive and low-cost analgesia during
      the HSG procedure. The results of this trial will provide data on the feasibility
      and safety of VR distraction therapy during HSG. Trial registration: Chinese
      Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR1900021342. Registered on 16 February 2019.

TI  - Routes of non-traditional entry into buprenorphine treatment programs.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: Excessive prescribing, increased potency of opioids, and increased
      availability of illicit heroin and synthetic analogs such as fentanyl has
      resulted in an increase of overdose fatalities. Medications for opioid use
      disorder (MOUD) significantly reduces the risk of overdose when compared with no 
      treatment. Although the use of buprenorphine as an agonist treatment for opioid
      use disorder (OUD) is growing significantly, barriers remain which can prevent or
      delay treatment. In this study we examine non-traditional routes which could
      facilitate entry into buprenorphine treatment programs. Methods: Relevant,
      original research publications addressing entry into buprenorphine treatment
      published during the years 1989–2019 were identified through PubMed, PsychInfo,
      PsychArticles, and Medline databases. We operationalized key terms based on three
      non-traditional paths: persons that entered treatment via the criminal justice
      system, following emergencies, and through community outreach. Results: Of 462
      screened articles, twenty studies met the inclusion criteria for full review.
      Most studies were from the last several years, and most (65%) were from the
      Northeastern region of the United States. Twelve (60%) were studies suggesting
      that the criminal justice system could be a potentially viable entry route, both 
      pre-release or post-incarceration. The emergency department was also found to be 
      a cost-effective and viable route for screening and identifying individuals with 
      OUD and linking them to buprenorphine treatment. Fewer studies have documented
      community outreach initiatives involving buprenorphine. Most studies were small
      sample size (mean = < 200) and 40% were randomized trials. Conclusions: Despite
      research suggesting that increasing the number of Drug Addiction Treatment Act
      (DATA) waived physicians who prescribe buprenorphine would help with the opioid
      treatment gap, little research has been conducted on routes to increase
      utilization of treatment. In this study, we found evidence that engaging
      individuals through criminal justice, emergency departments, and community
      outreach can serve as non-traditional treatment entry points for certain
      populations. Alternative routes could engage a greater number of people to
      initiate MOUD treatment.

TI  - Morphine plasmatic concentration in a pregnant mare and its foal after long term 
      epidural administration.
LID - 19
AB  - Background: Epidural administration of morphine has been shown to be an effective
      analgesic strategy in horses; however, the possible occurrence of side effects
      limits its usage. In order to decrease their frequency, it is important to target
      the minimal effective plasma concentration and avoid overdosing. As to date
      species-specific pharmacokinetics data are not available for epidural morphine,
      the dosing regimen is usually established on the basis of clinical reports and
      personal experience. In certain physiological conditions, like gestation, the
      outcome of an empirical dosing scheme can be unpredictable. The aim of this case 
      report is to describe the pharmacological profile of morphine and its metabolites
      after prolonged epidural administration in a pregnant mare and her foal. Case
      presentation: A 20 years old pregnant mare was presented to our hospital because 
      of severe lameness, 2 months before delivery. Following an ineffective systemic
      pain treatment, an epidural catheter was inserted and morphine administered
      (initial dose 0.1 mg/kg every 8 h). Due to its efficacy in controlling pain, it
      was continued until end of gestation. Plasmatic concentration of morphine and its
      metabolites were assessed in the mare 6 weeks after starting the treatment, and
      in both the mare and foal during the first days after delivery. Plasmatic values 
      similar to those previously reported in the literature following morphine short
      term administration through various routes and not accompanied by side effects
      were found in the mare, except during an excitatory period. Moreover, no evidence
      of dangerous drug accumulation or significant milk passage was noticed in the
      foal. Mild reduction of feces production with no signs of colic and two
      self-limiting episodes of excitement occurred during treatment in the mare. No
      side effects occurred during gestation and first phases of life in the foal.
      Conclusion: Prolonged epidural administration of morphine in a pregnant mare
      allowed good pain control in absence of clinically relevant side effects, in both
      the mare and her foal. Sudden increase in morphine plasmatic concentration can
      occur and side effects appear; careful treatment to the lowest effective dose and
      continuous monitoring of the clinical condition of the treated horse should be
      performed.

TI  - Re-prioritizing traffic stops to reduce motor vehicle crash outcomes and racial
      disparities.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: Law enforcement traffic stops are one of the most common entryways to
      the US justice system. Conventional frameworks suggest traffic stops promote
      public safety by reducing dangerous driving practices and non-vehicular crime.
      Law enforcement agencies have wide latitude in enforcement, including
      prioritization of stop types: (1) safety (e.g. moving violation) stops, (2)
      investigatory stops, or (3) economic (regulatory and equipment) stops. In order
      to prevent traffic crash fatalities and reduce racial disparities, the police
      department of Fayetteville, North Carolina significantly re-prioritized safety
      stops. Methods: Annual traffic stop, motor vehicle crash, and crime data from
      2002 to 2016 were combined to examine intervention (2013–2016) effects.
      Fayetteville was compared against synthetic control agencies built from 8 similar
      North Carolina agencies by weighted matching on pre-intervention period trends
      and comparison against post-intervention trends. Results: On average over the
      intervention period as compared to synthetic controls, Fayetteville increased
      both the number of safety stops + 121% (95% confidence interval + 17%, + 318%)
      and the relative proportion of safety stops (+ 47%). Traffic crash and injury
      outcomes were reduced, including traffic fatalities − 28% (− 64%, + 43%),
      injurious crashes − 23% (− 49%, + 16%), and total crashes − 13% (− 48%, + 21%).
      Disparity measures were reduced, including Black percent of traffic stops − 7%
      (− 9%, − 5%) and Black vs. White traffic stop rate ratio − 21% (− 29%, − 13%). In
      contrast to the Ferguson Effect hypothesis, the relative de-prioritization of
      investigatory stops was not associated with an increase in non-traffic crime
      outcomes, which were reduced or unchanged, including index crimes − 10% (− 25%,
      + 8%) and violent crimes − 2% (− 33%, + 43%). Confidence intervals were estimated
      using a different technique and, given small samples, may be asymmetrical.
      Conclusions: The re-prioritization of traffic stop types by law enforcement
      agencies may have positive public health consequences both for motor vehicle
      injury and racial disparity outcomes while having little impact on non-traffic
      crime.

TI  - The Role of CYP450 Drug Metabolism in Precision Cardio-Oncology.
LID - 604
AB  - As many novel cancer therapies continue to emerge, the field of Cardio-Oncology
      (or onco-cardiology) has become crucial to prevent, monitor and treat cancer
      therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity. Furthermore, given the narrow
      therapeutic window of most cancer therapies, drug-drug interactions are prevalent
      in the cancer population. Consequently, there is an increased risk of affecting
      drug efficacy or predisposing individual patients to adverse side effects. Here
      we review the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in the field of
      Cardio-Oncology. We highlight the importance of cardiac medications in preventive
      Cardio-Oncology for high-risk patients or in the management of cardiotoxicities
      during or following cancer treatment. Common interactions between Oncology and
      Cardiology drugs are catalogued, emphasizing the impact of differential
      metabolism of each substrate drug on unpredictable drug bioavailability and
      consequent inter-individual variability in treatment response or development of
      cardiovascular toxicity. This inter-individual variability in bioavailability and
      subsequent response can be further enhanced by genomic variants in CYP450, or by 
      modifications of CYP450 gene, RNA or protein expression or function in various
      ‘omics’ related to precision medicine. Thus, we advocate for an individualized
      approach to each patient by a multidisciplinary team with clinical pharmacists
      evaluating a treatment plan tailored to a practice of precision Cardio-Oncology. 
      This review may increase awareness of these key concepts in the rapidly evolving 
      field of Cardio-Oncology.

TI  - New Perspective in Diabetic Neuropathy: From the Periphery to the Brain, a Call
      for Early Detection, and Precision Medicine.
LID - 929
AB  - Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes
      mellitus. It leads to distressing and expensive clinical sequelae such as foot
      ulceration, leg amputation, and neuropathic pain (painful-DPN). Unfortunately,
      DPN is often diagnosed late when irreversible nerve injury has occurred and its
      first presentation may be with a diabetic foot ulcer. Several novel diagnostic
      techniques are available which may supplement clinical assessment and aid the
      early detection of DPN. Moreover, treatments for DPN and painful-DPN are limited.
      Only tight glucose control in type 1 diabetes has robust evidence in reducing the
      risk of developing DPN. However, neither glucose control nor pathogenetic
      treatments are effective in painful-DPN and symptomatic treatments are often
      inadequate. It has recently been hypothesized that using various patient
      characteristics it may be possible to stratify individuals and assign them
      targeted therapies to produce better pain relief. We review the diagnostic
      techniques which may aid the early detection of DPN in the clinical and research 
      environment, and recent advances in precision medicine techniques for the
      treatment of painful-DPN.

TI  - Socioeconomic risk factors for fatal opioid overdoses in the United States:
      Findings from the Mortality Disparities in American Communities Study (MDAC).
LID - e0227966
AB  - Background: Understanding relationships between individual-level demographic,
      socioeconomic status (SES) and U.S. opioid fatalities can inform interventions in
      response to this crisis. Methods: The Mortality Disparities in American Community
      Study (MDAC) links nearly 4 million 2008 American Community Survey responses to
      the 2008–2015 National Death Index. Univariate and multivariable models were used
      to estimate opioid overdose fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). Results: Opioid overdose was an overrepresented cause of death
      among people 10 to 59 years of age. In multivariable analysis, compared to
      Hispanics, Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives had elevated risk (HR =
      2.52, CI:2.21–2.88) and (HR = 1.88, CI:1.35–2.62), respectively. Compared to
      women, men were at-risk (HR = 1.61, CI:1.50–1.72). People who were disabled were 
      at higher risk than those who were not (HR = 2.80, CI:2.59–3.03). Risk was higher
      among widowed than married (HR = 2.44, CI:2.03–2.95) and unemployed than employed
      individuals (HR = 2.46, CI:2.17–2.79). Compared to adults with graduate degrees, 
      those with high school only were at-risk (HR = 2.48, CI:2.00–3.06). Citizens were
      more likely than noncitizens to die from this cause (HR = 4.62, CI:3.48–6.14).
      Compared to people who owned homes with mortgages, those who rented had higher
      HRs (HR = 1.36, CI:1.25–1.48). Non-rural residents had higher risk than rural
      residents (HR = 1.46, CI:1.34, 1.59). Compared to respective referent groups,
      people without health insurance (HR = 1.30, CI:1.20–1.41) and people who were
      incarcerated were more likely to die from opioid overdoses (HR = 2.70,
      CI:1.91–3.81). Compared to people living in households at least five-times above 
      the poverty line, people who lived in poverty were more likely to die from this
      cause (HR = 1.36, CI:1.20–1.54). Compared to people living in West North Central 
      states, HRs were highest among those in South Atlantic (HR = 1.29, CI:1.11, 1.50)
      and Mountain states (HR = 1.58, CI:1.33, 1.88). Discussion: Opioid fatality was
      associated with indicators of low SES. The findings may help to target
      prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts to vulnerable groups.

TI  - Feasibility and Acceptability of an mHealth-Based Approach as an HIV Prevention
      Strategy Among People Who Use Drugs on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis.
PG  - 107-18
AB  - Introduction: There has been increasing interest in the use of mHealth technology
      in health care. To our knowledge, however, there is a lack of empirical evidence 
      on the utilization of text messaging services (short message service; SMS) for
      HIV prevention among opioid-dependent people who use drugs (PWUD). As part of our
      formative work, we conducted an in-depth feasibility and acceptability study on
      the use of SMS reminders for HIV prevention in this risk group. Methods: Forty
      HIV-negative, opioid-dependent PWUD who are currently taking pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) were enrolled in the study. Participants received daily PrEP
      text reminders and weekly HIV risk reduction-related messages, which were
      developed using a user-centered approach. Participants were assessed at baseline 
      and immediately post-intervention. Following the post-intervention assessment,
      participants completed an in-depth qualitative interview. Results: Feasibility of
      text messaging service was high, as assessed by participants’ willingness to
      receive text messages (100%), retention (95%), and successful delivery of text
      messages (97%). Results further showed that participants were satisfied and
      perceived the use of daily PrEP reminder text messages as valuable and acceptable
      [mean: 75.0 (range 0–100)]. Whereas, acceptability for the weekly text messages
      on HIV risk reduction was 60.3 (±15.6), with 58.3% recommending them for future
      use. Thematic data exploration revealed important information for understanding
      and refining SMS content as well as logistical preferences. Conclusion: Our
      findings provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and acceptability of a
      text messaging-based approach as a potential tool for primary HIV prevention to
      improve PrEP adherence and HIV risk reduction among this underserved population. 
      HIV risk reduction text messages need further modifications to become more
      appealing, with participant feedback taken into consideration.

TI  - Fluoroscopy-Guided Percutaneous Sacroplasty for Painful Metastases at the Sacral 
      Ala.
PG  - 151-6
AB  - Objective: Percutaneous sacroplasty (PSP) is widely used in the clinic for
      osteoporotic sacral insufficiency fractures; however, few reports have described 
      the safety and effectiveness of PSP for painful sacral metastases at the sacral
      ala under fluoroscopy alone. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      fluoroscopy-guided PSP for painful metastases at the sacral ala. Patients and
      Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients (median age, 60.74 ± 12.74 years), with
      a total of 41 metastatic lesions at the sacral ala, were treated with PSP. The
      patients were followed up for periods ranging from 1 month to 30 months (average,
      8.23 ± 6.75 months). The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index
      (ODI), and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) were used to evaluate pain,
      mobility, and quality of life before the procedure and at 3 days and 1, 3, 6, 12,
      and 18 months after the procedure. Results: Technical success was achieved in all
      patients. The minimum follow-up duration was 1 month. The mean VAS scores
      declined significantly from 7.20 ± 0.93 before the procedure to 3.43 ± 1.38 by
      day 3 after the procedure, and was 3.13 ± 1.07 at 1 month, 3.17 ± 1.15 at 3
      months, 2.91± 1.38 at 6 months, and 2.57 ± 1.51 at 12 months after the procedure 
      (P < 0.001). After PSP, analgesic drug administration had been discontinued in 31
      of 35 patients (88.57%). The ODI and KPS also changed after PSP, with significant
      differences between the baseline scores and those at each follow-up examination
      (P < 0.001). Extraosseous cement leakage occurred in 12 cases without any major
      clinical complications. Conclusion: PSP is a safe and effective technique for the
      palliative treatment of painful metastases involving the sacral ala under
      fluoroscopic guidance alone. It can relieve pain, reduce disability, and improve 
      function, and is associated with minimal complications.

TI  - Incidence of Opioid Overdose Among Patients Using ER/LA Opioid Analgesics Before 
      and After Implementation of the Class-Wide Opioid Risk Evaluation and Mitigation 
      Strategy.
PG  - 157-69
AB  - Introduction: The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required 
      a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and
      long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics on 09 July 2012. Methods: This study
      compared the incidence of opioid overdose before (July 2010-June 2012) and after 
      (July 2013-September 2016) the initiation of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
      Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics.
      We identified patients with ≥1 ER/LA opioid dispensing in either time period in
      national data from the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and in
      United States (US) Medicaid claims data from four states. We described each
      population, calculated the incidence rate (IR) of opioid overdose, and assessed
      crude and propensity score adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing the
      overdose rate after vs before implementation of the REMS. Results: A total of
      121,229 commercially insured and 11,488 Medicaid patients were included in the
      analysis. Rates of overdose were substantially higher in Medicaid patients than
      in the commercially insured patients (IR 192.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      162.60–225.18 versus 102.60, 95% CI 93.0–112.93 in the active period). The IRRs
      for opioid overdose were 1.01 (95% CI 0.87–1.17) in the commercially insured
      population and 0.70 (95% CI 0.52–0.93) in Medicaid. Conclusion: This leveling off
      of overdose rates among commercially insured patients and decline among Medicaid 
      patients is encouraging, but it is difficult to disentangle the specific impact
      of the REMS from many other ongoing initiatives with similar goals.

TI  - Medicinal cannabis for psychiatric disorders: a clinically-focused systematic
      review.
LID - 24
AB  - Background: Medicinal cannabis has received increased research attention over
      recent years due to loosening global regulatory changes. Medicinal cannabis has
      been reported to have potential efficacy in reducing pain, muscle spasticity,
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and intractable childhood epilepsy. Yet
      its potential application in the field of psychiatry is lesser known. Methods:
      The first clinically-focused systematic review on the emerging medical
      application of cannabis across all major psychiatric disorders was conducted.
      Current evidence regarding whole plant formulations and plant-derived cannabinoid
      isolates in mood, anxiety, sleep, psychotic disorders and attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is discussed; while also detailing clinical
      prescription considerations (including pharmacogenomics), occupational and public
      health elements, and future research recommendations. The systematic review of
      the literature was conducted during 2019, assessing the data from all case
      studies and clinical trials involving medicinal cannabis or plant-derived
      isolates for all major psychiatric disorders (neurological conditions and pain
      were omitted). Results: The present evidence in the emerging field of cannabinoid
      therapeutics in psychiatry is nascent, and thereby it is currently premature to
      recommend cannabinoid-based interventions. Isolated positive studies have,
      however, revealed tentative support for cannabinoids (namely cannabidiol; CBD)
      for reducing social anxiety; with mixed (mainly positive) evidence for adjunctive
      use in schizophrenia. Case studies suggest that medicinal cannabis may be
      beneficial for improving sleep and post-traumatic stress disorder, however
      evidence is currently weak. Preliminary research findings indicate no benefit for
      depression from high delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) therapeutics, or for CBD 
      in mania. One isolated study indicates some potential efficacy for an oral
      cannabinoid/terpene combination in ADHD. Clinical prescriptive consideration
      involves caution in the use of high-THC formulations (avoidance in youth, and in 
      people with anxiety or psychotic disorders), gradual titration, regular
      assessment, and caution in cardiovascular and respiratory disorders, pregnancy
      and breast-feeding. Conclusions: There is currently encouraging, albeit
      embryonic, evidence for medicinal cannabis in the treatment of a range of
      psychiatric disorders. Supportive findings are emerging for some key isolates,
      however, clinicians need to be mindful of a range of prescriptive and
      occupational safety considerations, especially if initiating higher dose THC
      formulas.

TI  - Developing a clinical decision support for opioid use disorders: a NIDA center
      for the clinical trials network working group report.
LID - 4
AB  - There is an urgent need for strategies to address the US epidemic of prescription
      opioid, heroin and fentanyl-related overdoses, misuse, addiction, and diversion. 
      Evidence-based treatment such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are
      available but lack numbers of providers offering these services to meet the
      demands. Availability of electronic health record (EHR) systems has greatly
      increased and led to innovative quality improvement initiatives but this has not 
      yet been optimized to address the opioid epidemic or to treat opioid use disorder
      (OUD). This report from a clinical decision support (CDS) working group convened 
      by the NIDA Center for the Clinical Trials Network aims to converge electronic
      technology in the EHR with the urgent need to improve screening, identification, 
      and treatment of OUD in primary care settings through the development of a CDS
      algorithm that could be implemented as a tool in the EHR. This aim is consistent 
      with federal, state and local government and private sector efforts to improve
      access and quality of MOUD treatment for OUD, existing clinical quality and HEDIS
      measures for OUD or drug and alcohol use disorders, and with a recent draft grade
      B recommendation from the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) for
      screening for illicit drug use in adults when appropriate diagnosis, treatment
      and care services can be offered or referred. Through a face-to-face expert panel
      meeting and multiple follow-up conference calls, the working group drafted CDS
      algorithms for clinical care felt to be essential for screening, diagnosis, and
      management of OUD in primary care. The CDS algorithm was reviewed by addiction
      specialists and primary care providers and revised based on their input. A
      clinical decision support tool for OUD screening, assessment, and treatment
      within primary care systems may help improve healthcare delivery to help address 
      the current epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose that has outpaced the capacity
      of specialized treatment settings. A semi-structured outline of clinical decision
      support for OUD was developed to facilitate implementation within the EHR.
      Further work for adaptation at specific sites and for testing is needed.

TI  - The effectiveness of substance use interventions for homeless and vulnerably
      housed persons:  A systematic review of systematic reviews on supervised
      consumption facilities, managed alcohol programs, and pharmacological agents for 
      opioid use disorder.
LID - e0227298
AB  - Background: Substance use is disproportionately high among people who are
      homeless or vulnerably housed. We performed a systematic overview of reviews
      examining the effects of selected harm reduction and pharmacological
      interventions on the health and social well-being of people who use substances,
      with a focus on homeless populations. Methods and findings: We searched MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, PsycINFO, Joanna Briggs Institute EBP, Cochrane Database of Systematic
      Reviews and DARE for systematic reviews from inception to August 2019. We
      conducted a grey literature search and hand searched reference lists. We selected
      reviews that synthesized evidence on supervised consumption facilities, managed
      alcohol programs and pharmacological interventions for opioid use disorders. We
      abstracted data specific to homeless or vulnerably housed populations. We
      assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Our search identified
      483 citations and 30 systematic reviews met all inclusion criteria, capturing the
      results from 442 primary studies. This included three reviews on supervised
      consumption facilities, 24 on pharmacological interventions, and three on managed
      alcohol programs. Supervised consumption facilities decreased lethal overdoses
      and other high risk behaviours without any significant harm, and improved access 
      to care. Pharmaceutical interventions reduced mortality, morbidity, and substance
      use, but the impact on retention in treatment, mental illness and access to care 
      was variable. Managed alcohol programs reduced or stabilized alcohol consumption.
      Few studies on managed alcohol programs reported deaths. Conclusions: Substance
      use is a common chronic condition impacting homeless populations. Supervised
      consumption facilities reduce overdose and improve access to care, while
      pharmacological interventions may play a role in reducing harms and addressing
      other morbidity. High quality evidence on managed alcohol programs is limited.

TI  - A meta-ethnography to understand the experience of living with urinary
      incontinence: ‘is it just part and parcel of life?’.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) is highly prevalent and affects the lives
      of many men and women. We aimed to conduct a qualitative evidence synthesis (QES)
      to explore the experience of living with UI and to develop a conceptual model
      that can help us to understand this experience, and the potential barriers to
      appropriate healthcare. Methods: We used the methods of meta-ethnography
      developed by Noblit and Hare and recently refined for larger studies.
      Meta-ethnography involves identifying concepts from the studies and abstracting
      these concepts into a line of argument. We searched for studies that explored the
      experience of adults with UI. We used the GRADE-CERQual framework to assess
      confidence in review findings. Results: We screened 2307 titles, 429 abstracts,
      107 full texts and included 41 studies (36 unique samples) in the synthesis. We
      organised the concepts into 26 conceptual categories, which we further abstracted
      into 6 themes: (1) Am I ill or is this normal? (2) It effects who I am and how I 
      feel; (3) I feel stigmatised, ashamed and guilty; (4) talking can be difficult
      but it can help; (5) keeping incontinence under control; (6) have I got to the
      point that I need help? Our model conceptualises living with UI as navigating
      antagonists: Is UI normal or am I ill? Do I need help or am I managing? Do I keep
      UI to myself (and manage alone) or do I tell other people (and get the support
      that I need)? Do I use control strategies that focus on concealing (avoid risky
      situations, wear pads) versus, I use strategies that focus on improving the
      bodily function to improve continence. Our model highlights the experience of
      stigma, shame and guilt which exert a pull towards concealment. Conclusions: The 
      culture of secrecy and profound sense of shame is barrier to seeking help. An
      environment which reduces the shame and stigma of UI may help people to switch
      the focus to strategies that will improve continence, rather than conceal
      incontinence.

TI  - Toxicology studies of aqueous-alcohol extracts of Harpagophytum procumbens subsp.
      procumbens (Burch.) DC.Ex Meisn. (Pedaliaceae) in female and male rats.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: A variety of medicinal products prepared from secondary tubers of
      Harpagophytum procumbens subsp. procumbens (Burch.) DC.ex Meisn. (Devil’s Claw)
      and H. zeyheri are marketed in Africa, Europe, the United States, South America
      and elsewhere, where they are used for inflammatory and musculoskeletal
      conditions such as arthritis, lower back pain, rheumatism and neuralgia, etc.
      While clinical studies conducted over the last twenty years support the general
      safety of such products, infrequent gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhea,
      nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), headache, vertigo and hypersensitivity
      (allergic) reactions (rash, hives and face swelling) have been documented.
      Sex-related differences occur in the health conditions for which Devil’s Claw
      products are used, so it is likely that usage is similarly sex-related and so
      might be side effects and potential toxicities. However toxicologic studies of
      Devil’s Claw products have been conducted primarily with male animals. To address
      this deficit, we report toxicological studies in female and male rats of several 
      H. procumbens (HP) aqueous-alcohol extracts chemically analyzed by UPLC-MS.
      Methods: Female and male Sprague Dawley rats were studied for one and three
      months in groups differing by consumption of diets without and with HP extracts
      at a 7–10-fold human equivalent dose (HED). Sera were analyzed for blood
      chemistry, and heart, liver, lung, kidney, stomach, and small and large intestine
      tissues were examined for histopathology. Treatment group differences for blood
      chemistry were analyzed by ANOVA with Dunnett’s test and significant group
      differences for endpoints with marginal distributional properties were verified
      using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Group differences for histopathology were tested
      using Chi Square analysis. Results: Significant group by sex-related differences 
      in blood chemistry were detected in both studies. Additionally, several
      sex-related differences occurred between the studies. However, significant
      histopathology effects associated with the consumption of the extracts were not
      detected. Conclusion: Toxicologic analysis of Devil’s Claw extracts cause
      significant sex-related effects in blood chemistry. However, in our judgement,
      none of the observed effects suggest serious toxicity at these doses and
      durations. Subsequent toxicologic and clinical studies of H. procumbens and other
      medicines with similar properties should explore in greater detail the basis and 
      consequences of potential sex-related effects.

TI  - Therapeutic use of cannabis and cannabinoids: an evidence mapping and appraisal
      of systematic reviews.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: Although cannabis and cannabinoids are widely used with therapeutic
      purposes, their claimed efficacy is highly controversial. For this reason,
      medical cannabis use is a broad field of research that is rapidly expanding. Our 
      objectives are to identify, characterize, appraise, and organize the current
      available evidence surrounding therapeutic use of cannabis and cannabinoids,
      using evidence maps. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library
      and CINAHL, to identify systematic reviews (SRs) published from their inception
      up to December 2017. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data
      independently. We assessed methodological quality of the included SRs using the
      AMSTAR tool. To illustrate the extent of use of medical cannabis, we organized
      the results according to identified PICO questions using bubble plots
      corresponding to different clinical scenarios. Results: A total of 44 SRs
      published between 2001 and 2017 were included in this evidence mapping with data 
      from 158 individual studies. We extracted 96 PICO questions in the following
      medical conditions: multiple sclerosis, movement disorders (e.g. Tourette
      Syndrome, Parkinson Disease), psychiatry conditions, Alzheimer disease, epilepsy,
      acute and chronic pain, cancer, neuropathic pain, symptoms related to cancer
      (e.g. emesis and anorexia related with chemotherapy), rheumatic disorders,
      HIV-related symptoms, glaucoma, and COPD. The evidence about these conditions is 
      heterogeneous regarding the conclusions and the quality of the individual primary
      studies. The quality of the SRs was moderate to high according to AMSTAR scores. 
      Conclusions: Evidence on medical uses of cannabis is broad. However, due to
      methodological limitations, conclusions were weak in most of the assessed
      comparisons. Evidence mapping methodology is useful to perform an overview of
      available research, since it is possible to systematically describe the extent
      and distribution of evidence, and to organize scattered data.

      (TKR) plus non-surgical treatment compared with non-surgical treatment with the
      option of later TKR if needed. Methods: 100 adults with moderate-to-severe knee
      osteoarthritis found eligible for TKR by an orthopaedic surgeon in secondary care
      were randomised to TKR plus 12 weeks of supervised non-surgical treatment
      (exercise, education, diet, insoles and pain medication) or to supervised
      non-surgical treatment alone. Including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) data 
      from baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, effectiveness was measured as change at 24
      months. Healthcare costs and transfer payments were derived from national
      registries. Incremental healthcare costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness
      ratios (ICERs) were calculated. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was
      conducted and the probability of cost-effectiveness was estimated at the 22 665
      Euros/QALY threshold defined by the National Institute for Health and Care
      Excellence. Results: TKR plus non-surgical treatment was more expensive (mean of 
      23 076 vs 14 514 Euros) but also more effective than non-surgical treatment (mean
      24-month improvement in QALY of 0.195 vs 0.056). While cost-effective in the
      unadjusted scenario (ICER of 18 497 Euros/QALY), TKR plus non-surgical treatment 
      was not cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of
      later TKR if needed in the adjusted (age, sex and baseline values), base-case
      scenario (ICER of 32 611 Euros/QALY) with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 
      23.2%. Including deaths, TKR plus non-surgical treatment was still not
      cost-effective (ICERs of 46 277 to 64 208 Euros/QALY). Conclusions: From a
      24-month perspective, TKR plus non-surgical treatment does not appear to be
      cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of later TKR 
      if needed in patients with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis and moderate
      intensity pain in secondary care in Denmark. Results were sensitive to changes,
      highlighting the need for further confirmatory research also assessing the
      long-term cost-effectiveness of TKR. Trial registration number:
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01410409).

TI  - Healthcare Resource Use and Cost: The Impact of Adopting an Abuse-Deterrent
      Formulation of Extended Release Morphine.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - Background: Development of abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs) of prescription
      opioids (RxO) is an important step toward reducing misuse and abuse.
      Morphine-ARER (MorphaBond™ ER) is an extended-release (ER) morphine sulfate
      tablet formulated to deter misuse/abuse via intravenous (IV) and intranasal (IN) 
      routes of administration. Objective: A model was developed to estimate the budget
      impact to a hypothetical commercial health plan of 10 million members 2 years
      after adding morphine-ARER to drug formulary. Methods: We analyzed incremental
      health care resource use (HCRU) associated with RxO misuse/abuse based on a
      health plan’s RxO formulary coverage and patterns of misuse/abuse. Misuse/abuse
      rates, incremental HCRU and associated costs were based on the 2015 National
      Survey on Drug Use and Health, an analysis of claims from OptumHealth Care
      Solutions, Inc. (2013–2015) and published literature. RxO formulary shares were
      based on 2016–2017 Symphony Retail Prescription data. Morphine-ARER was assumed
      to capture 20 and 30 percent from branded and 0.3 and 0.6 percent from generic
      non-ADF ER morphine, in the first and second years, respectively. Proportions of 
      misuse/abuse deterred by physical/chemical properties of morphine-ARER were
      assumed to be 90 percent via IV and 60 percent via IN administration, with
      further IN deterrence based on results from morphine-ARER’s human abuse liability
      study. Results: Adding morphine-ARER to formulary resulted in a potential
      decrease in abuse-related healthcare costs by $557,321 (−$0.00232 per-member
      per-month [PMPM]), offsetting a pharmacy cost increase of $217,045 (+$0.00090
      PMPM), resulting in net cost-savings of $0.00142 PMPM over 2 years, based on
      certain model assumptions. Conclusion: Placing morphine-ARER on a health plan’s
      drug formulary may result in reduced misuse/abuse and overall cost savings.

TI  - Rediscovery of Ceruletide, a CCK Agonist, as an Analgesic Drug.
PG  - 123-30
AB  - Ceruletide (CRL) is a decapeptide, originating from the skin of a tropical frog, 
      and is many times more potent that cholecystokinin (CCK) in a number of assays.
      The compound was first isolated and characterized around 50 years ago, and its
      analgesic properties were subsequently identified. Since the 1980s it has been
      available in the clinic as a parenteral solution and is used as a diagnostic tool
      to characterize pancreas and gall bladder malfunctions. Its analgesic properties 
      were evaluated in a number of indications: cancer pain, burns, colic pains and
      migraine. Preclinically, CRL reduces pain in low microgram dose range and
      promotes clear and long-lasting analgesic activity in nanograms when applied
      centrally. CCK is amongst the most widely expressed neuropeptides in the brain.
      CCK-induced analgesic effects in response to persistent and inflammatory pain
      have recently been associated with CCK2 receptor signaling. CRL, a potent CCK
      agonist, might be worthwhile to rediscover as a putative analgesic drug and could
      represent a potential analgesic intrathecal strategy to patients with
      cancer-related pain.

TI  - Association of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants use and
      falls in trauma patients: Conditional effect of age.
LID - e0227696
AB  - Introduction: The relationship between benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic
      antidepressants and trauma is of great importance because of increased
      consumption and the growing evidence of a positive association among older
      adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effect size of the
      association between the consumption of psychotropic medications /opioids and
      falls in patients who have suffered trauma by studying the role of other
      variables in this relationship. Method: From 2011 to 2016, the presence of
      benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and other drugs in 1060
      patients admitted for trauma at a level I trauma hospital was analysed.
      Multivariate models were used to measure the adjusted effect size of the
      association between consumption of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic
      antidepressants and falls, and the effect of age on this association was studied.
      Results: A total of 192 patients tested positive for benzodiazepines, opioids and
      tricyclic antidepressants, with same-level falls being the most frequent
      mechanism of injury in this group (40.1%), with an odds ratio of 1.96
      (1.40–2.75), p < 0.001. Once other covariates were introduced, this association
      was not observed, leaving only age, gender (woman) and, to a lesser extent,
      sensory conditions as variables associated with falls. Age acted as an effect
      modifier between benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and
      falls, with significant effect sizes starting at 51.9 years of age. Conclusions: 
      The association between the consumption of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic
      antidepressants and falls in patients admitted for trauma is conditioned by other
      confounding variables, with age being the most influential confounding variable.

TI  - Estimating the impact of drug use on US mortality, 1999-2016.
LID - e0226732
AB  - The impact of rising drug use on US mortality may extend beyond deaths coded as
      drug-related to include excess mortality from other causes affected by drug use. 
      Here, we estimate the full extent of drug-associated mortality. We use annual
      death rates for 1999–2016 by state, sex, five-year age group, and cause of death 
      to model the relationship between drug-coded mortality—which serves as an
      indicator of the population-level prevalence of drug use—and mortality from other
      causes. Among residents aged 15–64 living in the 50 US states, the estimated
      number of drug-associated deaths in 2016 (141,695) was 2.2 times the number of
      drug-coded deaths (63,000). Adverse trends since 2010 in midlife mortality are
      largely attributable to drug-associated mortality. In the absence of drug use, we
      estimate that the probability of dying between ages 15 and 65 would have
      continued to decline after 2010 among men (to 15% in 2016) and would have
      remained at a low level (10%) among women. Our results suggest that an additional
      3.9% of men and 1.8% of women died between ages 15 and 65 in 2016 because of drug
      use. In terms of life expectancy beyond age 15, we estimate that drug use cost
      men 1.4 years and women 0.7 years, on average. In the hardest-hit state (West
      Virginia), drug use cost men 3.6 and women 1.9 life years. Recent declines in US 
      life expectancy have been blamed largely on the drug epidemic. Consistent with
      that inference, our results imply that, in the absence of drug use, life
      expectancy at age 15 would have increased slightly between 2014 and 2016.
      Drug-associated mortality in the US is roughly double that implied by drug-coded 
      deaths alone. The drug epidemic is exacting a heavy cost to American lives, not
      only from overdoses but from a variety of causes.

TI  - High-frequency spinal cord stimulation at 10 kHz for the treatment of painful
      diabetic neuropathy: design of a multicenter, randomized controlled trial
      (SENZA-PDN).
LID - 87
AB  - Background: Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), a debilitating and progressive
      chronic pain condition that significantly impacts quality of life, is one of the 
      common complications seen with long-standing diabetes mellitus. Neither
      pharmacological treatments nor low-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has
      provided significant and long-term pain relief for patients with PDN. This study 
      aims to document the value of 10-kHz SCS in addition to conventional medical
      management (CMM) compared with CMM alone in patients with refractory PDN.
      Methods: In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (SENZA-PDN), 
      216 subjects with PDN will be assigned 1:1 to receive 10-kHz SCS combined with
      CMM or CMM alone after appropriate institutional review board approvals and
      followed for 24 months. Key inclusion criteria include (1) symptoms of PDN for at
      least 12 months, (2) average pain intensity of at least 5 cm—on a 0- to 10-cm
      visual analog scale (VAS)—in the lower limbs, and (3) an appropriate candidate
      for SCS. Key exclusion criteria include (1) large or gangrenous ulcers or (2)
      average pain intensity of at least 3 cm on VAS in the upper limbs or both. Along 
      with pain VAS, neurological assessments, health-related quality of life, sleep
      quality, and patient satisfaction will be captured. The primary endpoint
      comparing responder rates (≥50% pain relief) and safety rates between the
      treatment groups will be assessed at 3 months. Several secondary endpoints will
      also be reported on. Discussion: Enrollment commenced in 2017 and was completed
      in 2019. This study will help to determine whether 10-kHz SCS improves clinical
      outcomes and health-related quality of life and is a cost-effective treatment for
      PDN that is refractory to CMM. Trial registration: ClincalTrials.gov identifier: 
      NCT03228420 (registered 24 July 2017).

TI  - De novo variants in exomes of congenital heart disease patients identify risk
      genes and pathways.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects ~ 1% of live births and is the
      most common birth defect. Although the genetic contribution to the CHD has been
      long suspected, it has only been well established recently. De novo variants are 
      estimated to contribute to approximately 8% of sporadic CHD. Methods: CHD is
      genetically heterogeneous, making pathway enrichment analysis an effective
      approach to explore and statistically validate CHD-associated genes. In this
      study, we performed novel gene and pathway enrichment analyses of high-impact de 
      novo variants in the recently published whole-exome sequencing (WES) data
      generated from a cohort of CHD 2645 parent-offspring trios to identify new
      CHD-causing candidate genes and mutations. We performed rigorous variant- and
      gene-level filtrations to identify potentially damaging variants, followed by
      enrichment analyses and gene prioritization. Results: Our analyses revealed 23
      novel genes that are likely to cause CHD, including HSP90AA1, ROCK2, IQGAP1, and 
      CHD4, and sharing biological functions, pathways, molecular interactions, and
      properties with known CHD-causing genes. Conclusions: Ultimately, these findings 
      suggest novel genes that are likely to be contributing to CHD pathogenesis.

LID - 001406
AB  - Chemotherapy usually causes complications affecting several tissues such as oral 
      mucosa. In this case report, a soft palate oral ulcer caused by chemotherapy was 
      treated by ozone gas. This kind of treatment is known for its antimicrobial,
      regenerative and analgesic proprieties. The results show a complete resolution of
      the lesion within 2 weeks of treatment. Ozone therapy demonstrates greater
      effectiveness with respect to this kind of oral lesion compared to traditional
      therapy. Considering this evidence, ozone therapy should be considered as a
      useful tool for the adjuvant therapy of oral complications in oncologic
      patients.LEARNING POINTS: Intensive chemotherapy can have side effects,
      particularly affecting tissue with higher turnover. Therefore, there is a
      clinical need to prevent or to treat such complications.Ozone therapy could
      improve oral mucosa healing and have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
      antibacterial effects to prevent suprainfections. To date, there are no reported 
      cases of oral ulcers in oncologic patients being completely resolved using ozone 
      in the literature.Medical and dental doctors should collaborate with regards to
      complex patients to prevent such types of complications, discovering these
      clinical cases that are unknown in the literature and treating patients in a more
      comprehensive way.

TI  - Hepatitis C Virus Prevalence in 50 U.S. States and D.C. by Sex, Birth Cohort, and
      Race: 2013‐2016.
PG  - 355-70
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver‐related morbidity
      and mortality, and more than 2 million adults in the United States are estimated 
      to be currently infected. Reducing HCV burden will require an understanding of
      demographic disparities and targeted efforts to reduce prevalence in populations 
      with disproportionate disease rates. We modeled state‐level estimates of
      hepatitis C prevalence among U.S. adults by sex, birth cohort, and race during
      2013‐2016. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data were used in
      combination with state‐level HCV‐related and narcotic overdose–related mortality 
      data from the National Vital Statistics System and estimates from external
      literature review on populations not sampled in the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey. Nationally, estimated hepatitis C prevalence was 1.3% among
      males and 0.6% among females (prevalence ratio [PR] = 2.3). Among persons born
      during 1945 to 1969, prevalence was 1.6% compared with 0.5% among persons born
      after 1969 (PR = 3.2). Among persons born during 1945 to 1969, prevalence ranged 
      from 0.7% in North Dakota to 3.6% in Oklahoma and 6.8% in the District of
      Columbia. Among persons born after 1969, prevalence was more than twice as high
      in Kentucky, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and West Virginia compared with the national
      average. Hepatitis C prevalence was 1.8% among non‐Hispanic black persons and
      0.8% among persons of other races (PR = 2.2), and the magnitude of this disparity
      varied widely across jurisdictions (PR range: 1.3‐7.8). Overall, 23% of prevalent
      HCV infections occurred among non‐Hispanic black persons, whereas 12% of the
      population was represented by this racial group. These estimates provide
      information on prevalent HCV infections that jurisdictions can use for
      understanding and monitoring local disease patterns and racial disparities in
      burden of disease.

TI  - Effect of Inflammation on Female Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Neurons:
      Mechanisms and Consequences.
LID - 529
AB  - Inflammation has a well-known suppressive effect on fertility. The function of
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, the central regulator of fertility
      is substantially altered during inflammation in females. In our review we discuss
      the latest results on how the function of GnRH neurons is modified by
      inflammation in females. We first address the various effects of inflammation on 
      GnRH neurons and their functional consequences. Second, we survey the possible
      mechanisms underlying the inflammation-induced actions on GnRH neurons. The role 
      of several factors will be discerned in transmitting inflammatory signals to the 
      GnRH neurons: cytokines, kisspeptin, RFamide-related peptides, estradiol and the 
      anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway. Since aging and obesity are both
      characterized by reproductive decline our review also focuses on the mechanisms
      and pathophysiological consequences of the impact of inflammation on GnRH neurons
      in aging and obesity.

TI  - Understanding the Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Pathogenesis of Arthritis
      Pain Using Animal Models.
LID - 533
AB  - Arthritis, including osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is the
      leading cause of years lived with disability (YLD) worldwide. Although pain is
      the cardinal symptom of arthritis, which is directly related to function and
      quality of life, the elucidation of the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of 
      pain in arthritis has lagged behind other areas, such as inflammation control and
      regulation of autoimmunity. The lack of therapeutics for optimal pain management 
      is partially responsible for the current epidemic of opioid and narcotic abuse.
      Recent advances in animal experimentation and molecular biology have led to
      significant progress in our understanding of arthritis pain. Despite the inherent
      problems in the extrapolation of data gained from animal pain studies to
      arthritis in human patients, the critical assessment of molecular mediators and
      translational studies would help to define the relevance of novel therapeutic
      targets for the treatment of arthritis pain. This review discusses biological and
      molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of arthritis pain determined in 
      animal models of OA and RA, along with the methodologies used.

TI  - Predicting high-risk opioid prescriptions before they are given.
PG  - 1917-23
AB  - We describe a hypothetical preventative policy solution to address the opioid
      crisis using an integrated administrative database developed in collaboration
      with the State of Rhode Island. Machine learning algorithms trained on
      observations of past opioid prescription accurately predict adverse
      opioid-related outcomes among Medicaid recipients even before their initial
      opioid prescription is written. Although these models are limited to individuals 
      who have been selected for opioid prescription, they suggest a feasible path
      forward for using administrative data to inform prescription risk. Under the
      assumption that the cost of diverting individuals from opioid therapy to an
      alternative therapy is homogenous across individuals, we simulate a hypothetical 
      policy for restricting opioid prescriptions based on risk that is likely
      net-beneficial given current cost estimates.

      retrospective cohort study.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Pain is a common and burdensome complication in patients with acute
      stroke. We assessed the impact of impaired communication in stroke patients on
      pain assessment and treatment. Methods: We included 909 (507 male, mean age
      71.8 years) patients admitted to our stroke unit from 01/2015 to 12/2015 in the
      analysis. Patients were assigned to four groups: able to communicate (AC), not
      able to communicate prior to index stroke (P-NAC), due to focal symptoms of index
      stroke (S-NAC), due to a reduced level of consciousness (C-NAC). Pain prevalence,
      documentation of pain and use of analgesics were evaluated. C-NAC patients were
      excluded from analyses regarding analgesic treatment due to relevant differences 
      in patient characteristics. Results: 746 patients (82.1%) were classified as AC, 
      25 (2.8%) as P-NAC, 90 (9.9%) as S-NAC and 48 (5.3%) as C-NAC. Pain was
      documented on the Numeric Rating Scale and in form of free text by nurses and
      physicians. Nurses documented pain more frequently than physicians (p < 0.001).
      Pain prevalence was 47.0% (n.s. between groups). The use of analgesic medication 
      increased from 48.7% in the AC group, to 76.0% in the P-NAC group, and 77.8% in
      the S-NAC group (p < 0.001). Opioid use was significantly more frequent in NAC
      patients (p < 0.001). The response to the treatment was poorly documented with
      significantly lowest rates in S-NAC patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study 
      suggests that post-stroke pain in patients with inability to communicate is not
      attended enough, not systematically assessed and therefore not sufficiently
      treated.

TI  - The Value Proposition for Pathologists: A Population Health Approach.
LID - 2374289519898857
AB  - The transition to a value-based payment system offers pathologists the
      opportunity to play an increased role in population health by improving outcomes 
      and safety as well as reducing costs. Although laboratory testing itself accounts
      for a small portion of health-care spending, laboratory data have significant
      downstream effects in patient management as well as diagnosis. Pathologists
      currently are heavily engaged in precision medicine, use of laboratory and
      pathology test results (including autopsy data) to reduce diagnostic errors, and 
      play leading roles in diagnostic management teams. Additionally, pathologists can
      use aggregate laboratory data to monitor the health of populations and improve
      health-care outcomes for both individual patients and populations. For the
      profession to thrive, pathologists will need to focus on extending their roles
      outside the laboratory beyond the traditional role in the analytic phase of
      testing. This should include leadership in ensuring correct ordering and
      interpretation of laboratory testing and leadership in population health
      programs. Pathologists in training will need to learn key concepts in informatics
      and data analytics, health-care economics, public health, implementation science,
      and health systems science. While these changes may reduce reimbursement for the 
      traditional activities of pathologists, new opportunities arise for value
      creation and new compensation models. This report reviews these opportunities for
      pathologist leadership in utilization management, precision medicine, reducing
      diagnostic errors, and improving health-care outcomes.

TI  - COPD and asthma in patients with opioid dependency: a cross-sectional study in
      primary care.
LID - 4
AB  - Patients treated for drug addiction have high asthma and COPD prevalence rates.
      The relative contributions of cigarette smoking, smoking intensity and possible
      smoking of other substances has not been described. We aimed to describe the
      prevalence and determinants of asthma and COPD in patients prescribed methadone
      as opioid substitution therapy (OST). In a cross-sectional study of an anonymised
      patient-level primary care dataset of UK inner-city general practices (n = 46),
      321,395 patients aged ≥18 years were identified. A total of 676 (0.21%) had a
      record of a methadone ever issued in primary care. The association between
      respiratory disease and methadone prescribing was examined using logistic
      regression. Models were adjusted for potential effects of clustering by practice.
      A total of 97.3% of patients prescribed methadone were cigarette smokers, either 
      current (81.2%) or ex-smokers (16.1%). The prevalences of asthma and COPD were
      higher in methadone patients (14.2% and 12.4%, respectively) compared to
      non-methadone patients (4.4% and 1.1%, respectively). Methadone was an
      independent determinant of asthma, adjusting for smoking status (OR 3.21; 95% CI:
      2.52, 4.10) or for smoking intensity (3.08; 2.27, 4.19), and of COPD, adjusting
      for smoking status (6.00; 4.61, 7.80) or for smoking intensity (5.80; 4.12,
      8.17). COPD and asthma prevalence were substantially higher in those prescribed
      methadone compared to those never prescribed methadone. Prescription of methadone
      was an independent predictor for both COPD and asthma, even after adjustment for 
      smoking status and smoking intensity. Possible explanations include confounding
      by association with smoking of heroin or crack cocaine, both of which may have a 
      causal association with COPD and asthma.

TI  - Phase I and registry study of autologous bone marrow concentrate evaluated in
      PDE5 inhibitor refractory erectile dysfunction.
LID - 24
AB  - Background: Bone marrow mononuclear cells have been successfully utilized for
      numerous regenerative purposes. In the current study, patients suffering from
      erectile dysfunction (ED) unresponsive to phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors were
      administered autologous bone marrow concentrate delivered intracavernously
      utilizing a point of care FDA cleared medical device. Methods: A total of 40
      patients were treated in the primary trial and 100 in the clinical registry, with
      the longest follow up of 12 months. Results: Minimal treatment associated adverse
      effects where observed related to short term bruising at the site of harvest or
      injection. No long-term adverse events were noted related to the intervention.
      Mean improvements in IIEF-5 score were 2 in the Caverstem 1.0 low dose group, 3
      in the high dose Caverstem 1.0 group and 9 in the Caverstem 2.0 group.
      Furthermore, improvements peaked by 3 months and maintained at 6 months
      follow-up. Conclusion: These data support the safety and efficacy of point of
      care, minimally to non-manipulated, non-expanded bone marrow concentrate for the 
      treatment of ED.Trial registration Funded by Creative Medical Health, Inc.;

TI  - Long-Term Efficacy of Safinamide on Symptoms Severity and Quality of Life in
      Fluctuating Parkinson’s Disease Patients.
PG  - 89-97
AB  - Background:: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by a wide range of motor
      and non-motor symptoms. Levodopa is still the most effective drug; however, its
      long-term use is associated with motor complications which may deteriorate
      patient’s quality of life. Safinamide is a unique treatment modulating both
      dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. Previous results from two six months,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled studies demonstrated that safinamide has
      positive effects on both motor functions and quality of life in PD patients.
      Objective:: To investigate the effects of safinamide 100 mg/day over two-year
      treatment on PD symptoms severity and quality of life, using data from the study 
      018. Methods:: Data from 352 patients were analyzed to evaluate the effects of
      safinamide on OFF time and ON time (with no or non-troublesome dyskinesia) in the
      overall population and in subgroups of patients (receiving levodopa monotherapy
      or with other anti-Parkinson therapies), and the effects of safinamide on motor
      symptoms/clinical fluctuations (by means of UPDRS III and IV) and on
      health-related quality of life (using UPDRS II and PDQ-39 summary index score).
      Results:: Safinamide, administered as add-on to standard therapy in fluctuating
      PD patients, significantly improved motor symptoms and clinical fluctuations in
      the overall population and in some subgroups of patients. Additionally,
      safinamide improved quality of life and activities of daily living, maintaining
      the efficacy in the long-term. Conclusions:: The findings of these analyses
      suggest that safinamide may be considered an appropriate adjunct therapy in
      patient not sufficiently controlled. Further investigations are desirable to
      confirm these results in usual care setting.

TI  - Avocado–Soybean Unsaponifiables: A Panoply of Potentialities to Be Exploited.
LID - 130
AB  - Avocado and soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) constitute vegetable extracts made from
      fruits and seeds of avocado and soybean oil. Characterized by its potent
      anti-inflammatory effects, this ASU mixture is recommended to act as an adjuvant 
      treatment for osteoarthritic pain and slow-acting symptomatic treatment of hip
      and knee osteoarthritis; autoimmune diseases; diffuse scleroderma and
      scleroderma-like states (e.g., morphea, sclerodactyly, scleroderma in bands).
      Besides, it was reported that it can improve the mood and quality of life of
      postmenopausal women in reducing menopause-related symptoms. This article aims to
      summarize the studies on biological effects of the avocado–soybean
      unsaponifiable, its chemical composition, pharmacotherapy as well as applications
      in autoimmune, osteoarticular and menopausal disorders. Finally, we will also
      discuss on its safety, toxicological and regulatory practices.

TI  - Continuous Fentanyl Background Infusion Regimen Optimised by Patient-Controlled
      Analgesia for Acute Postoperative Pain Management: A Randomised Controlled Trial.
LID - 211
AB  - Owing to a lack of studies investigating the effect of adjustments in fentanyl
      background infusion (BI) with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) on postoperative
      analgesia, we evaluated three BI regimens with fentanyl PCA for acute
      postoperative pain management. This randomised controlled trial enrolled 105
      patients, who were assigned to three parallel groups: constant rate BI of 2 mL/h 
      (CRBI group); time-scheduled decremental BI of 6, 2 and 1 mL/h (TDBI group); and 
      BI rates optimised to the demand of PCA (POBI group). The incidence of
      insufficient analgesia, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score and side effects
      were evaluated. The incidence of insufficient analgesia in the post-anaesthesia
      care unit was lower in the TDBI and POBI groups than the CRBI group. Incidence of
      insufficient analgesia in the ward was lower in the POBI group than the CRBI
      group. Postoperative VAS scores were significantly lower in the TDBI and POBI
      groups for up to 4 h and 24 h, respectively, compared with the CRBI group. Side
      effects and infused fentanyl dose were highest in the CRBI group. Adjusting BI
      rate based on time or patient demands could improve postoperative analgesia and
      reduce side effects. Compared to a constant BI rate, PCA-optimised BI achieved
      higher patient satisfaction.

TI  - Design of a randomized controlled trial to Link Infectious and Narcology Care
      (LINC-II) in St. Petersburg, Russia.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: If Russia is to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 HIV targets, better
      approaches to engage, effectively treat, and retain patients in care are needed. 
      This paper describes the protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing 
      the effectiveness of LINC-II, a strength-based case management program for
      HIV-positive people who inject drugs (PWID) to increase rates of HIV viral
      suppression, ART initiation, and opioid abstinence. Methods: This RCT will enroll
      and randomize 240 participants, recruited from a narcology (addiction care)
      hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia. Participants are randomized to the
      intervention or control arms. Those in the intervention arm receive: (1)
      strengths-based HIV case management supporting coordinated care; (2) rapid ART
      initiation; and (3) pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder. We will evaluate the
      intervention’s effectiveness compared to standard of care on the following
      outcomes: (1) undetectable HIV viral load at 12 months (primary); (2) initiation 
      of ART within 28 days of randomization; (3) change in CD4 count from baseline to 
      12 months; (4) retention in HIV care (i.e., ≥ 1 visit to medical care in 2
      consecutive 6 month periods); (5) undetectable HIV viral load at 6 months; and
      (6) past 30-day opioid abstinence (at 6 and at 12 months). Discussion: This RCT
      will assess the LINC-II intervention in an urban Russian setting. If effective,
      it will offer a new approach for increasing the uptake of both HIV and opioid use
      disorder treatment and coordination of these modalities in standard Eastern
      European clinical settings.Trial registration This study was registered with

TI  - Factors predicting one-year post-surgical mortality amongst older Asian patients 
      undergoing moderate to major non-cardiac surgery – a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 11
AB  - Background: While short-term perioperative outcomes have been well studied in
      Western surgical populations, the aim of this study is to look at the one-year
      perioperative mortality and its associated factors in an Asian surgical
      population after non-cardiac surgery. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of
      2163 patients aged above 45 undergoing non-cardiac surgery in a
      university-affiliated tertiary hospital from January to July 2015 was performed. 
      Relevant demographic, clinical and surgical data were analysed to elicit their
      relationship to mortality at one year after surgery. A univariate analysis was
      first performed to identify significant variables with p-values ≤ 0.2, which were
      then analysed using Firth multiple logistic regression to calculate the adjusted 
      odds ratio. Results: The one-year mortality in our surgical population was 5.9%. 
      The significant factors that increased one-year mortality include smoking
      (adjusted OR 2.17 (1.02–4.45), p = 0.044), anaemia (adjusted OR 1.32 (1.16–1.47),
      p < 0.001, for every 1 g/dL drop in haemoglobin level), lower BMI (adjusted OR
      0.93 (0.87–0.98), p = 0.005, for every 1 point increase in BMI), Malay and Indian
      ethnicity (adjusted OR 2.68 (1.53–4.65), p = 0.001), peripheral vascular disease 
      (adjusted OR 4.21 (1.62–10.38), p = 0.004), advanced age (adjusted OR 1.04
      (1.01–1.06), p = 0.004, for every one year increase in age), emergency surgery
      (adjusted OR 2.26 (1.29–3.15), p = 0.005) and malignancy (adjusted OR 3.20
      (1.85–5.52), p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study shows that modifiable risk
      factors such as malnutrition, anaemia and smoking which affect short term
      mortality extend beyond the immediate perioperative period into longer term
      outcomes. Identification and optimization of this subset of patients are
      therefore vital. Further similar large studies should be done to develop a risk
      scoring system for post-operative long-term outcomes. This would aid clinicians
      in risk stratification, counselling and surgical planning, which will help in
      patients’ decision making and care planning.

TI  - Associations of Patient Mood, Modulators of Quality of Life, and Pharmaceuticals 
      with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Survival Duration.
LID - 33
AB  - Associations of modulators of quality of life (QoL) and survival duration are
      assessed in the fatal motor neuron disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Major 
      categories include clinical impression of mood (CIM); physical health; patient
      social support; and usage of interventions, pharmaceuticals, and supplements.
      Associations were assessed at p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 significance thresholds
      using applicable methods (Chi-square, t-test, ANOVA, logistical regression,
      random forests, Fisher’s exact test) within a retrospective cohort of 1585
      patients. Factors significantly correlated with positive (happy or normal) mood
      included family support and usage of bi-level positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP)
      and/or cough assist. Decline in physical factors like presence of dysphagia,
      drooling, general pain, and decrease in ALSFRS-R total score or forced vital
      capacity (FVC) significantly correlated with negative (depressed or anxious) mood
      (p < 0.05). Use of antidepressants or pain medications had no association with
      ALS patient mood (p > 0.05), but were significantly associated with increased
      survival (p < 0.05). Positive patient mood, Bi-PAP, cough assist, percutaneous
      endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and accompaniment to clinic visits associated with 
      increased survival duration (p < 0.001). Of the 47 most prevalent pharmaceutical 
      and supplement categories, 17 associated with significant survival duration
      increases ranging +4.5 to +16.5 months. Tricyclic antidepressants, non-opioids,
      muscle relaxants, and vitamin E had the highest associative increases in survival
      duration (p < 0.05). Random forests, which examined complex interactions,
      identified the following pharmaceuticals and supplements as most predictive to
      survival duration: Vitamin A, multivitamin, PEG supplements, alternative herbs,
      antihistamines, muscle relaxants, stimulant laxatives, and antispastics. Statins,
      metformin, and thiazide diuretics had insignificant associations with decreased
      survival.

TI  - Low Testosterone in Adolescents & Young Adults.
LID - 916
AB  - Male hypogonadism, the clinical syndrome with variable symptoms associated with
      gonadal dysfunction, can affect men of all ages. In older males, physiologic
      changes of the aging testis, account for the majority of decreased testosterone
      levels in this population. For younger males and adolescents, the etiology of
      hypogonadism is commonly due to congenital or acquired conditions that disrupt
      the testis production of testosterone or signaling from the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Diagnosis of hypogonadism in younger males
      can be a challenge, as symptoms such as decreased libido or erectile dysfunction,
      common in the older men, are not usually present, and young men instead commonly 
      complain of low energy. While an underlying congenital cause should always be
      considered in young men with hypogonadism, acquired conditions such as obesity,
      diabetes, anabolic steroid or illicit drug use have all been associated with low 
      testosterone levels. Outside of modifying identifiable risk factors for
      hypogonadism, pharmacologic testosterone therapy can also lead to therapeutic
      dilemmas in young men who desire paternity. Topical or injectable administration 
      of testosterone, through negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, can
      decrease spermatogenesis, posing an infertility risk. Other agents that can
      replace testosterone or increase the body's natural production of testosterone
      without decreasing spermatogenesis are preferred, such as intranasal
      testosterone, selective estrogen modulators, aromatase inhibitors or
      human-chorionic gonadotrophin, often used in combination. Clinicians must
      maintain a high level of suspicion to properly diagnose young men with
      hypogonadism and tailor treatment based on both the underlying etiology and
      fertility goals.

TI  - Behavioral and Neuroanatomical Account of Impulsivity in Parkinson's Disease.
LID - 1338
AB  - Impulse control disorder (ICD) is a major non-motor complication of Parkinson's
      disease (PD) with often devastating consequences for patients' quality of life.
      In this study, we aimed to characterize the phenotype of impulsivity in PD and
      its neuroanatomical correlates.Methods: Thirty-seven PD patients (15 patients
      with ICD, 22 patients without ICD) and 36 healthy controls underwent a
      neuropsychological battery. The test battery consisted of anxiety and depression 
      scales, self-report measures of impulsivity (Barratt scale and UPPS-P),
      behavioral measures of impulsive action (Go/No-Go task, Stop signal task) and
      impulsive choice (Delay discounting, Iowa gambling task), and measures of
      cognitive abilities (working memory, attention, executive function). Patients and
      controls underwent structural MRI scanning.Results: Patients with ICD had
      significantly higher levels of self-reported impulsivity (Barratt scale and Lack 
      of perseverance from UPPS-P) in comparison with healthy controls and
      non-impulsive PD patients, but they performed similarly in behavioral tasks,
      except for the Iowa gambling task. In this task, patients with ICD made
      significantly less risky decisions than patients without ICD and healthy
      controls. Patients without ICD did not differ from healthy controls in
      self-reported impulsivity or behavioral measurements. Both patient groups were
      more anxious and depressive than healthy controls. MRI scanning revealed
      structural differences in cortical areas related to impulse control in both
      patient groups. Patients without ICD had lower volumes and cortical thickness of 
      bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Patients with ICD had higher volumes of right
      caudal anterior cingulate and rostral middle frontal cortex.Conclusions: Despite 
      the presence of ICD as confirmed by both clinical follow-up and self-reported
      impulsivity scales and supported by structural differences in various neural
      nodes related to inhibitory control and reward processing, patients with ICD
      performed no worse than healthy controls in various behavioral tasks previously
      hypothesized as robust impulsivity measures. These results call for caution
      against impetuous interpretation of behavioral tests, since various factors may
      and will influence the ultimate outcomes, be it the lack of sensitivity in
      specific, limited ICD subtypes, excessive caution of ICD patients during testing 
      due to previous negative experience rendering simplistic tasks insufficient, or
      other, as of now unknown aspects, calling for further research.

TI  - Improving the organization and interactivity of metabolic pathfinding with
      precomputed pathways.
LID - 13
AB  - Background: The rapid growth of available knowledge on metabolic processes across
      thousands of species continues to expand the possibilities of producing chemicals
      by combining pathways found in different species. Several computational search
      algorithms have been developed for automating the identification of possible
      heterologous pathways; however, these searches may return thousands of pathway
      results. Although the large number of results are in part due to the large number
      of possible compounds and reactions, a subset of core reaction modules is
      repeatedly observed in pathway results across multiple searches, suggesting that 
      some subpaths between common compounds were more consistently explored than
      others.To reduce the resources spent on searching the same metabolic space, a new
      meta-algorithm for metabolic pathfinding, Hub Pathway search with Atom Tracking
      (HPAT), was developed to take advantage of a precomputed network of subpath
      modules. To investigate the efficacy of this method, we created a table
      describing a network of common hub metabolites and how they are biochemically
      connected and only offloaded searches to and from this hub network onto an
      interactive webserver capable of visualizing the resulting pathways. Results: A
      test set of nineteen known pathways taken from literature and metabolic databases
      were used to evaluate if HPAT was capable of identifying known pathways. HPAT
      found the exact pathway for eleven of the nineteen test cases using a diverse set
      of precomputed subpaths, whereas a comparable pathfinding search algorithm that
      does not use precomputed subpaths found only seven of the nineteen test cases.
      The capability of HPAT to find novel pathways was demonstrated by its ability to 
      identify novel 3-hydroxypropanoate (3-HP) synthesis pathways. As for pathway
      visualization, the new interactive pathway filters enable a reduction of the
      number of displayed pathways from hundreds down to less than ten pathways in
      several test cases, illustrating their utility in reducing the amount of
      presented information while retaining pathways of interest. Conclusions: This
      work presents the first step in incorporating a precomputed subpath network into 
      metabolic pathfinding and demonstrates how this leads to a concise, interactive
      visualization of pathway results. The modular nature of metabolic pathways is
      exploited to facilitate efficient discovery of alternate pathways.

TI  - ABC efflux transporters at blood-central nervous system barriers and their
      implications for treating spinal cord disorders.
PG  - 1235-42
AB  - The barriers present in the interfaces between the blood and the central nervous 
      system form a major hurdle for the pharmacological treatment of central nervous
      system injuries and diseases. The family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporters has been widely studied regarding efflux of medications at
      blood-central nervous system barriers. These efflux transporters include
      P-glycoprotein (abcb1), ‘breast cancer resistance protein’ (abcg2) and the
      various ‘multidrug resistance-associated proteins’ (abccs). Understanding which
      efflux transporters are present at the blood-spinal cord, blood-cerebrospinal
      fluid and cerebrospinal fluid-spinal cord barriers is necessary to determine
      their involvement in limiting drug transfer from blood to the spinal cord tissue.
      Recent developments in the blood-brain barrier field have shown that barrier
      systems are dynamic and the profile of barrier defenses can alter due to
      conditions such as age, disease and environmental challenge. This means that a
      true understanding of ABC efflux transporter expression and localization should
      not be one static value but instead a range that represents the complex patient
      subpopulations that exist. In the present review, the blood-central nervous
      system barrier literature is discussed with a focus on the impact of ABC efflux
      transporters on: (i) protecting the spinal cord from adverse effects of
      systemically directed drugs, and (ii) limiting centrally directed drugs from
      accessing their active sites within the spinal cord.

TI  - Challenges and Opportunities in Preclinical Research of Synthetic Cannabinoids
      for Pain Therapy.
LID - 24
AB  - Cannabis has been used in pain management since 2900 BC. In the 20th century,
      synthetic cannabinoids began to emerge, thus opening the way for improved
      efficacy. The search for new forms of synthetic cannabinoids continues and, as
      such, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive tool for the research 
      and development of this promising class of drugs. Methods for the in vitro
      assessment of cytotoxic, mutagenic or developmental effects are presented,
      followed by the main in vivo pain models used in cannabis research and the
      results yielded by different types of administration (systemic versus intrathecal
      versus inhalation). Animal models designed for assessing side-effects and
      long-term uses are also discussed. In the second part of this review,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of synthetic cannabinoid
      biodistribution, together with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometric
      identification of synthetic cannabinoids in biological fluids from rodents to
      humans are presented. Last, but not least, different strategies for improving the
      solubility and physicochemical stability of synthetic cannabinoids and their
      potential impact on pain management are discussed. In conclusion, synthetic
      cannabinoids are one of the most promising classes of drugs in pain medicine, and
      preclinical research should focus on identifying new and improved alternatives
      for a better clinical and preclinical outcome.

TI  - Current Pharmacological Treatment of Painful Diabetic Neuropathy: A Narrative
      Review.
LID - 25
AB  - Background and Objectives: Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) is one of the
      most common chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. Although it is usually
      characterized by progressive sensory loss, some patients may develop chronic
      pain. Assessment of DSPN is not difficult, but the biggest challenge is making
      the correct diagnosis and choosing the right treatment. The treatment of DSPN has
      three primary objectives: glycemic control, pathogenic mechanisms, and pain
      management. The aim of this brief narrative review is to summarize the current
      pharmacological treatment of painful DSPN. It also summarizes knowledge on
      pathogenesis-oriented therapy, which is generally overlooked in many publications
      and guidelines. Materials and Methods: The present review reports the relevant
      information available on DSPN treatment. The search was performed on PubMed,
      Cochrane, Semantic Scholar, Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases,
      including among others the terms “distal symmetrical polyneuropathy”,
      “neuropathic pain treatment”, “diabetic neuropathy”, “diabetes complications”,
      ”glycaemic control”, “antidepressants”, “opioids”, and “anticonvulsants”.
      Results: First-line drugs include antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) and pregabalin. Second- and third-line 
      drugs include opioids and topical analgesics. While potentially effective in the 
      treatment of neuropathic pain, opioids are not considered to be the first choice 
      because of adverse reactions and addiction concerns. Conclusions: DSPN is a
      common complication in patients with diabetes, and severely affects the quality
      of life of these patients. Although multiple therapies are available, the
      guidelines and recommendations regarding the treatment of diabetic neuropathy
      have failed to offer a unitary consensus, which often hinders the therapeutic
      options in clinical practice.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Opioid Cessation.
LID - 180
AB  - The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) and
      overdose-related deaths. However, the genetic basis for the ability to
      discontinue opioid use has not been investigated. We performed a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) of opioid cessation (defined as abstinence from illicit 
      opioids for >1 year or <6 months before the interview date) in 1130 African
      American (AA) and 2919 European ancestry (EA) participants recruited for genetic 
      studies of substance use disorders and who met lifetime Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for OUD.
      Association tests performed separately within each ethnic group were combined by 
      meta-analysis with results obtained from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study.
      Although there were no genome-wide significant associations, we found suggestive 
      associations with nine independent loci, including three which are biologically
      relevant: rs4740988 in PTPRD (pAA + EA = 2.24 × 10−6), rs36098404 in MYOM2 (pEA =
      2.24 × 10−6), and rs592026 in SNAP25-AS1 (pEA = 6.53 × 10−6). Significant
      pathways identified in persons of European ancestry (EA) are related to vitamin D
      metabolism (p = 3.79 × 10−2) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (p =
      2.39 × 10−2). UK Biobank traits including smoking and drinking cessation and
      chronic back pain were significantly associated with opioid cessation using
      GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores. These results provide evidence for genetic
      influences on opioid cessation, suggest genetic overlap with other relevant
      traits, and may indicate potential novel therapeutic targets for OUD.

TI  - Physical Activity in Eating Disorders: A Systematic Review.
LID - 183
AB  - Abnormally high levels of physical activity have been documented throughout the
      literature in patients with eating disorders (ED), especially those diagnosed
      with anorexia nervosa (AN). Yet no clear definition, conceptualization, or
      treatment of the problematic use of physical activity (PPA) in ED patients
      exists. The aim of this review is to propose a new classification of PPA, report 
      the prevalence, triggers, predictors, maintainers and other related factors of
      PPA in ED patients, in addition to proposing a comprehensive model of the
      development of PPA in AN. A total of 47 articles, retrieved from Medline and Web 
      of Science, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. As a
      result, the new approach of PPA was divided into two groups (group 1 and group 2)
      according to the dimension (quantitative vs qualitative approach) of physical
      activity that was evaluated. The prevalence of PPA in ED was reported in 20 out
      of 47 studies, the comparison of PPA between ED versus controls in 21 articles,
      and the links between PPA and psychological factors in ED in 26 articles,
      including depression (16/26), anxiety (13/26), obsessive–compulsiveness (9/26),
      self-esteem (4/26), addictiveness (1/26), regulation and verbal expression of
      emotions (1/26) and anhedonia (1/26). The links between PPA and ED
      symptomatology, PPA and weight, body mass index (BMI) and body composition in ED,
      PPA and age, onset, illness duration and lifetime activity status in ED, PPA and 
      ED treatment outcome were reported in 18, 15, 7, 5 articles, respectively. All of
      the factors have been systematically clustered into group 1 and group 2. Results 
      focused more on AN rather than BN due to the limited studies on the latter.
      Additionally, a model for the development of PPA in AN patients was proposed,
      encompassing five periods evolving into three clinical stages. Thus, two very
      opposite components of PPA in AN were suggested: voluntarily PPA increased in AN 
      was viewed as a conscious strategy to maximize weight loss, while involuntarily
      PPA increased proportionally with weight-loss, indicating that exercise might be 
      under the control of a subconscious biological drive and involuntary cognition.

      Aortic Stenosis: A Case Report.
LID - 305
AB  - A 66-year-old patient with aortic stenosis was scheduled for an aortic valve
      replacement and coronary artery bypass surgery. Anesthesia was induced by
      intravenous injection of midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol. After administration 
      of rocuronium, he developed anaphylactic shock, which was diagnosed by clinical
      signs, vital parameters, and unresponsiveness to the usual vasopressors. After 30
      min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient survived without any
      neurological deficits. This case is a reminder that early recognition and
      treatment of intraoperative hypersensitivity reactions are imperative.
      Anesthetists should also receive simulation training to achieve an adequate
      experience in a safe environment. With a well-trained team, it is possible to
      save the life of patients with aortic stenosis.

TI  - Escalated Oxycodone Self-Administration and Punishment: Differential Expression
      of Opioid Receptors and Immediate Early Genes in the Rat Dorsal Striatum and
      Prefrontal Cortex.
LID - 1392
AB  - Opioid use disorder (OUD) is characterized by compulsive drug taking despite
      adverse life consequences. Here, we sought to identify neurobiological
      consequences associated with the behavioral effects of contingent footshocks
      administered after escalation of oxycodone self-administration. To reach these
      goals, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer oxycodone for 4 weeks 
      and were then exposed to contingent electric footshocks. This paradigm helped to 
      dichotomize rats into two distinct behavioral phenotypes: (1) those that reduce
      lever pressing (shock-sensitive) and (2) others that continue lever pressing
      (shock-resistant) for oxycodone during contingent punishment. The rats were
      euthanized at 2-h after the last oxycodone plus footshock session. The dorsal
      striata and prefrontal cortices were dissected for use in western blot and
      RT-qPCR analyses. All oxycodone self-administration rats showed significant
      decreased expression of Mu and Kappa opioid receptor proteins only in the dorsal 
      striatum. However, expression of Delta opioid receptor protein was decreased in
      both brain regions. RT-qPCR analyses documented significant decreases in the
      expression of c-fos, fosB, fra2, junB, egr1, and egr2 mRNAs in the dorsal
      striatum (but not in PFC) of the shock-sensitive rats. In the PFC, junD
      expression was reduced in both phenotypes. However, egr3 mRNA expression was
      increased in the PFC of only shock-resistant rats. These results reveal that,
      similar to psychostimulants and alcohol, footshocks can dichotomize rats that
      escalated their intake of oxycodone into two distinct behavioral phenotypes.
      These animals also show significant differences in the mRNA expression of
      immediate early genes, mainly, in the dorsal striatum. The increases in PFC egr3 
      expression in the shock-resistant rats suggest that Egr3 might be involved in the
      persistence of oxycodone-associated memory under aversive conditions. This
      punishment-driven model may help to identify neurobiological substrates of
      persistent oxycodone taking and abstinence in the presence of adverse
      consequences.

TI  - Women’s Perspectives On Provider Education Regarding Opioid Use.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - Objective: To elucidate women’s experiences with opioid medications and their
      perspectives on provider education regarding opioid use, risks and safety.
      Methods: Women with a self-reported history of pain who had been prescribed
      opioids were recruited in 2016 using a convenience sampling approach that
      included an online social media campaign. Participants (N=154) completed online
      surveys and open-ended questions regarding their experiences with pain and
      opioids, and their perspectives on the quality of education they received from
      their providers. Results: Participants reported receiving insufficient education 
      about opioid-related side effects, as reflected in both ratings for the quantity 
      and quality of education they received from their providers. Non-white
      participants reported lower quantity and poorer quality of provider education
      (p<0.05). Themes identified from the qualitative data included frustrations with 
      pain management options, fear of opioids, stigma associated with opioid use, and 
      the need for improved provider education and patient-provider communication.
      Conclusion: Findings suggest that from a patient’s perspective, there is a need
      for enhanced patient-provider communication and education regarding pain
      management and potential opioid-related side effects. Improved physician
      communication and education could promote shared decision-making and result in
      enhanced satisfaction with care and health outcomes.

TI  - Transient Osteoporosis of the Hip: Risk and Therapy.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of occupation in
      patients with transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH). The study also compares
      two different types of management for this condition: conservative treatment and 
      surgical drilling. Methods: This was a retrospective case series study. The
      medical records for patients diagnosed with TOH at our institution within the
      period 2012–2017 were retrieved. General demographic data, clinical features, and
      diagnostic modalities were obtained. In addition, management procedures and their
      associated prognostic factors were acquired. The effectiveness of these
      procedures was assessed by the number of days of sick leave, the time needed for 
      full recovery and the number of recurrences of TOH. Also, pain responses at 24
      hrs, 48 hrs, and at 1 week were estimated subjectively through a “pain score” out
      of 10, and objectively through the degree of improvement in daily activity. The
      patients had a regular follow-up at 4- to 6-week intervals. Results: In total, 15
      cases of TOH, 14 men and one woman, were enrolled in the study. The mean age of
      the patients was 41 years (range 26–59 years). Out of the 15 cases, nine were
      healthcare professionals (eight physicians and one nurse). Ten patients underwent
      hip drilling for core decompression and five patients were treated
      conservatively. The time needed for full recovery was 5.8 weeks for those who
      underwent drilling, and 48.3 weeks for three patients receiving conservative
      treatment. The other two patients who were treated conservatively had not
      achieved full or near-full recovery at the time of reporting this study.
      Conclusion: Physicians may be at increased risk of developing TOH. Further
      studies should be conducted to examine the role of this occupation as a risk
      factor. In addition, hip drilling should be considered as an effective treatment 
      modality, especially in those patients who seek a faster recovery.

TI  - Bowel movement frequency and risks of major vascular and non-vascular diseases: a
      population-based cohort study among Chinese adults.
LID - e031028
AB  - Objective: The application of bowel movement frequency (BMF) in primary care is
      limited by the lack of solid evidence about the associations of BMF with health
      outcomes apart from Parkinson’s disease and colorectal cancer. We examined the
      prospective associations of BMF with major vascular and non-vascular diseases
      outside the digestive system. Design: Population-based prospective cohort study. 
      Setting: The China Kadoorie Biobank in which participants from 10 geographically 
      diverse areas across China were enrolled between 2004 and 2008. Participants: 487
      198 participants aged 30 to 79 years without cancer, heart disease or stroke at
      baseline were included and followed up for a median of 10 years. The usual BMF
      was self-reported once at baseline. Primary and secondary outcome measures:
      Incident events of predefined major vascular and non-vascular diseases. Results: 
      In multivariable-adjusted analyses, participants having bowel movements ‘more
      than once a day’ had higher risks of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), heart
      failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared with the reference group (‘once a
      day’). The respective HRs (95% CIs) were 1.12 (1.09 to 1.16), 1.33 (1.22 to
      1.46), 1.28 (1.22 to 1.36), 1.20 (1.15 to 1.26) and 1.15 (1.07 to 1.24). The
      lowest BMF (‘less than three times a week’) was also associated with higher risks
      of IHD, major coronary events, ischaemic stroke and CKD. The respective HRs were 
      1.07 (1.02 to 1.12), 1.22 (1.10 to 1.36), 1.11 (1.05 to 1.16) and 1.20 (1.07 to
      1.35). Conclusion: BMF was associated with future risks of multiple vascular and 
      non-vascular diseases. The integration of BMF assessment and health counselling
      into primary care should be considered.

TI  - Postoperative intravenous parecoxib sodium followed by oral celecoxib post total 
      knee arthroplasty in osteoarthritis patients (PIPFORCE): a multicentre,
      double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
LID - e030501
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the morphine-sparing effects of the sequential treatment 
      versus placebo in subjects undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the effects 
      on pain relief, inflammation control and functional rehabilitation after TKA and 
      safety. Design: Double-blind, pragmatic, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.
      Setting: Four tertiary hospitals in China. Participants: 246 consecutive patients
      who underwent elective unilateral TKA because of osteoarthritis (OA).
      Interventions: Patients were randomised 1:1 to the parecoxib/celecoxib group or
      the control group. The patients in the parecoxib/celecoxib group were supplied
      sequential treatment with intravenous parecoxib 40 mg (every 12 hours) for the
      first 3 days after surgery, followed by oral celecoxib 200 mg (every 12 hours)
      for up to 6 weeks. The patients in the control group were supplied with the
      corresponding placebo under the same instructions. Primary and secondary outcome 
      measures: The primary endpoint was the cumulative opioid consumption at 2 weeks
      post operation (intention-to-treat analysis). Secondary endpoints included the
      Knee Society Score, patient-reported outcomes and the cumulative opioid
      consumption. Results: The cumulative opioid consumption at 2 weeks was
      significantly smaller in the parecoxib/celecoxib group than in the control group 
      (median difference, 57.31 (95% CI 34.66 to 110.33)). The parecoxib/celecoxib
      group achieving superior Knee Society Scores and EQ-5D scores and greater Visual 
      Analogue Scale score reduction during 6 weeks. Interleukin 6, erythrocyte
      sedation rate and C-reactive protein levels were reduced at 72 hours, 2 weeks and
      4 weeks and prostaglandin E2 levels were reduced at 48 hours and 72 hours in the 
      parecoxib/celecoxib group compared with the placebo group. The occurrence of
      adverse events (AEs) was significantly lower in the parecoxib/celecoxib group.
      Conclusions: The sequential intravenous parecoxib followed by oral celecoxib
      regimen reduces morphine consumption, achieves better pain control and functional
      recovery and leads to less AEs than placebo after TKA for OA. Trial registration 
      number: ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT02198924).

TI  - Investigating opioid-related fatalities in southern Sweden: contact with
      care-providing authorities and comparison of substances.
LID - 5
AB  - Background: Opioid-related deaths have increased in Western countries over recent
      decades. Despite numerous studies investigating opioid-related mortality, only a 
      few have focused on the lives of the deceased individuals prior to their deaths, 
      specifically regarding contact with care-providing authorities such as health,
      social and correctional services. Furthermore, a change has been noted in the
      last two decades as to which opioids cause most deaths, from heroin to
      prescription opioids. However, studies comparing fatalities caused by different
      substances are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate contact with
      care-providing authorities during the year prior to death among individuals who
      died as a result of opioid intoxication and to analyse differences relating to
      which opioids caused their deaths. Methods: The study is based on retrospective
      register data and includes 180 individuals with a history of illicit drug use,
      who died from opioid intoxication in Skåne, Sweden, between 1 January 2012 to 31 
      December 2013 and 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. Intoxications caused by heroin,
      methadone, buprenorphine and fentanyl were included. Data were collected from the
      National Board of Forensic Medicine, regional health care services, municipal
      social services and the Prison and Probation Service. Statistical testing was
      performed using Pearson’s chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test and the
      Mann-Whitney U test to analyse group differences. Results: A total of 89% of the 
      deceased individuals had been in contact with one or more of the care-providing
      authorities during the year prior to death; 75% had been in contact with health
      care, 69% with the social services, 28% with the Prison and Probation Service,
      and 23% had been enrolled in opioid substitution treatment at some point during
      their final year of life. Few differences appeared between the substance groups
      with regard to which opioid contributed to the death. In addition to opioids,
      sedatives were present in more than 80% of the cases. Individuals whose deaths
      were buprenorphine-related had been in contact with the social services to a
      significantly lesser extent during the year prior to death. Conclusions: The
      studied population is characterised by extensive contact with care-providing
      authorities, thus providing numerous opportunities for authorities to reach this 
      group with preventive and other interventions. Few differences emerged between
      groups with regard to which opioid had contributed to the death.

TI  - The effect of gestational diabetes mellitus on sufentanil consumption after
      cesarean section: a prospective cohort study.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown that patients with long-term diabetes
      require more opioids after surgery than patients without diabetes. Gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) normally only lasts for a brief period; nevertheless, its
      effect on sufentanil consumption after cesarean section is unknown. Methods: This
      prospective cohort study included two groups: a GDM group (n = 32) and a matched 
      non-GDM (NGDM) group (n = 32). All patients underwent routine combined
      spinal-epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Sufentanil consumption through 
      an intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, the frequency of PCA
      requests, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores 6 and 24 h after surgery were
      compared between groups. Results: Sufentanil consumption (μg) 6 h after surgery
      was higher in the GDM group than in the NGDM group (24.0 ± 6.6 vs 20.1 ± 5.7,
      P = 0.023). PCA was used more frequently 6 and 24 h after surgery by the GDM
      group than by the NGDM group (1[0–2] vs 0[0–1], P = 0.001; 6 [1–5] vs 3 [1, 2,
      6–8], P = 0.001, respectively). The VAS score during activity 24 h after surgery 
      was higher in the GDM group than in the NGDM group (5 [2, 3] vs 5 [1, 2],
      respectively, P = 0.03). Conclusion: Pregnant women with GDM require more opioids
      during the immediate postoperative period after cesarean section than those
      without GDM. Clinical trials registration: No. ChiCTR1800016014, ChenYang, May

TI  - Technical and clinical evaluation of a closed loop TIVA system with SEDLineTM
      spectral density monitoring: Multicentric prospective cohort study.
LID - 1
AB  - Introduction: Closed loop total intravenous anesthesia is a technique in which
      the patient’s hemodynamic and anesthetic depth variables are monitored, and based
      on this information, a computer controls the infusion rate of drugs to keep them 
      within pre-established clinical parameters. Objective: To describe the technical 
      and clinical performance of a closed loop system for total intravenous anesthesia
      with propofol and remifentanil, using the SEDLineTM monitor Design: Multicentric 
      prospective cohort study Setting: Surgery room Patients: ASA I-II undergoing
      elective surgery Measurements: The authors designed a closed loop system that
      implements a control algorithm based on anesthetic depth monitoring and the
      Patient State Index (PSITM) of the SEDLine monitor for propofol, and on
      hemodynamic variables for remifentanil. The measurement of clinical performance
      was made based on the percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the range 20–50.
      Precision analysis was evaluated by measuring median performance error (MDPE) can
      be defined as the median difference between actual and desired values, which
      refers to the degree of precision in which the controller is able to maintain the
      control variable within the objective set by the anesthesiologist; it represents 
      the direction (over-prediction or under-prediction) of performance error (PE)
      rather than size of errors, which is represented by MDAPE, median absolute
      percentage error, Wobble index, which is used for measuring the intrasubject
      variability in performance error. Results: Data were obtained from 93 patients in
      three healthcare centers. The percentage of PSITM maintenance time in the 20–50
      range was 92% (80.7–97.0). MDPE was 10.7 (− 11.0–18.0), MDAPE 21.0 (14.2–26.8)
      and wobble 10.7 (7.0–16.9). No adverse surgical or anesthetic events were found. 
      Conclusions: The closed loop total intravenous anesthesia system with SEDLine
      developed by the authors was used without major complication and appear to be
      feasible its use in clinical performance.

TI  - Mortality in a cohort of 3.1 million children, adolescents and young adults.
PG  - 260-8
AB  - Background: Many youth deaths occur in the first year of life, from prematurity
      and anomalies. Detailing mortality after age 1 year may differentially guide
      preventive strategies in children, adolescents and young adults. Methods: A
      cohort study in Ontario, Canada comprised 3 139 698 children born from 1990 to
      2016. Adjusted HR (aHR) for death between 1 and 24 years were generated,
      comparing demographic variables and parity. Results: After a median of 13.7 years
      of follow-up, 6930 deaths occurred between ages 1 and 24 years (incidence rate
      17.0 per 100 000 person-years), peaking at age 23 years (43.7 per 100 000). The
      aHR for death was higher among males than females (1.44, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.51),
      rural versus urban areas (1.48, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.58), lowest versus highest
      income areas (1.39, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51) and at parity 1 (1.16, 95% CI 1.10 to
      1.23), parity 2 (1.34, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.45), parity 3+ (1.96, 95% CI 1.74 to
      2.21), each relative to a child without an older sibling. Among males, the
      proportion of deaths due to injury jumped from 30% before age 15 years to 65%
      thereafter, and in females, from 28% to 51%. Intentional self-harm/assault
      explained 11% of injury-related deaths among males before age 15 years, and 20%
      thereafter, with respective figures of 18% and 17% for females. Deaths outside of
      hospital increased with age, from 35% at age 1 year, to 66% at age 22 years.
      Conclusion: There is a heightened susceptibility of dying starting at age 15
      years, especially among males, from injury, and arising outside of hospital.

TI  - Comparison of the Analgesic Effect of Ropivacaine with Fentanyl and Ropivacaine
      Alone in Continuous Epidural Infusion for Acute Herpes Zoster Management: A
      Retrospective Study.
LID - 22
AB  - Background and Objectives: Currently, few studies have reported the effects of
      opioids during continuous epidural infusion (CEI) to control pain owing to herpes
      zoster (HZ). This study aimed to retrospectively compare the effectiveness of
      epidural opioids in the treatment of acute HZ pain. Materials and Methods: We
      reviewed medical records of 105 patients who were divided into two groups: R
      group (CEI with ropivacaine) and RF group (CEI with ropivacaine and fentanyl).
      Clinical efficacy was evaluated using the numeric rating scale (NRS) score for 6 
      months after the procedures. We compared the percentage of patients with complete
      remission in each group. We investigated the complication rates during CEI.
      Results: No significant differences in the NRS scores were observed between the
      two groups in the 6-month period. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for patients
      included in the complete remission was 0.6 times lower in the RF group than in
      the R group (95% confidence interval: 0.22–1.71, p = 0.35). The OR for
      complications during CEI was higher in the RF group than in the R group. However,
      the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: No difference was 
      observed in the management of HZ pain and the prevention of postherpetic
      neuralgia between the two groups. The incidence of complications tended to be
      higher in the RF group than in the R group.

TI  - Sensor Technologies to Manage the Physiological Traits of Chronic Pain: A Review.
LID - 365
AB  - Non-oncologic chronic pain is a common high-morbidity impairment worldwide and
      acknowledged as a condition with significant incidence on quality of life. Pain
      intensity is largely perceived as a subjective experience, what makes challenging
      its objective measurement. However, the physiological traces of pain make
      possible its correlation with vital signs, such as heart rate variability, skin
      conductance, electromyogram, etc., or health performance metrics derived from
      daily activity monitoring or facial expressions, which can be acquired with
      diverse sensor technologies and multisensory approaches. As the assessment and
      management of pain are essential issues for a wide range of clinical disorders
      and treatments, this paper reviews different sensor-based approaches applied to
      the objective evaluation of non-oncological chronic pain. The space of available 
      technologies and resources aimed at pain assessment represent a diversified set
      of alternatives that can be exploited to address the multidimensional nature of
      pain.

TI  - Long‐Term Safety Evaluation of Ubrogepant for the Acute Treatment of Migraine:
      Phase 3, Randomized, 52‐Week Extension Trial.
PG  - 141-52
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the long‐term safety and tolerability of ubrogepant for
      the acute treatment of migraine. Background: Ubrogepant is an oral, calcitonin
      gene–related receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of
      migraine. The efficacy of ubrogepant was demonstrated in 2 phase 3 trials in
      which a significant improvement was observed in migraine headache pain,
      migraine‐associated symptoms, and ability to function. Methods: This was a phase 
      3, multicenter, randomized, open‐label, 52‐week extension trial. Adults with
      migraine with or without aura entered the trial after completing one of 2 phase 3
      lead‐in trials and were re‐randomized 1:1:1 to usual care, ubrogepant 50 mg, or
      ubrogepant 100 mg. Randomization to ubrogepant dose was blinded. Those randomized
      to usual care continued to treat migraine attacks with their own medication. The 
      usual care arm was included in this trial to capture background rates of hepatic 
      laboratory parameters and contextualize hepatic safety assessments. Safety and
      tolerability were the primary outcome measures. The safety population for the
      ubrogepant arms included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose
      of treatment. All cases of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST) elevations of ≥3 times the upper limit of normal were
      adjudicated by an independent panel of liver experts who were blinded to dose.
      Results: The safety population included 1230 participants (404 in the ubrogepant 
      50‐mg group, 409 in the ubrogepant 100‐mg group, and 417 in the usual care
      group). Participants were on average 42 years of age, 90% (1106/1230) female and 
      85% (1043/1230) white, with an average BMI of 30 kg/m2. Throughout the trial,
      21,454 migraine attacks were treated with 31,968 doses of ubrogepant.
      Treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 268/404 (66%)
      participants receiving ubrogepant 50 mg and 297/409 (73%) receiving ubrogepant
      100 mg. The most commonly reported TEAE was upper respiratory tract infection
      (<12%); findings were similar across dose groups. Treatment‐related TEAEs were
      reported by 42/404 (10%) participants in the ubrogepant 50‐mg group and 43/409
      (11%) in the ubrogepant 100‐mg group. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported
      by 9/404 (2%) participants in the ubrogepant 50‐mg group and 12/409 (3%)
      participants in the ubrogepant 100‐mg group. Twenty cases of ALT/AST levels of ≥3
      times the upper limit of normal were reported and reviewed by an independent
      clinical adjudication committee of liver experts. There were no cases of Hy’s
      Law. Conclusions: Long‐term intermittent use of ubrogepant 50 and 100 mg given as
      1 or 2 doses per attack for the acute treatment of migraine was safe and well
      tolerated, as indicated by a low incidence of treatment‐related TEAEs and SAEs
      and discontinuations due to adverse events in this 1‐year trial.

TI  - Non-Operating Room Anesthesia: Patient Selection and Special Considerations.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Non-operating room anesthesia (NORA) represents a growing field of medicine with 
      an increasing trend in the number of cases performed over the previous decade. As
      a result, anesthesia providers will need to enhance their familiarity with the
      resources, personnel, and environment outside of the operating room. Anesthesia
      delivery in NORA settings should be held with the same high-quality standards as 
      that within the operating room. This review looks at special considerations in
      patient selection and the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative
      periods. In addition, there is a discussion on the unique aspects of specific
      NORA areas and the considerations that come with them.

TI  - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for Primary Dysmenorrhea: An
      Overview.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Primary dysmenorrhea is a chronic health condition that affects primarily young
      women. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been suggested as
      an effective pain reduction modality in primary dysmenorrhea. TENS is a
      noninvasive, inexpensive, portable method with minimal risks and a few
      contraindications. When necessary, it can be self-administered on a daily basis
      during everyday activities. Several studies have investigated the effectiveness
      of TENS in reducing pain, decreasing the use of analgesics, and improving the
      quality of life in primary dysmenorrhea patients. These studies have some
      limitations in methodological quality and therapeutic validation. However, the
      overall positive effects of TENS in primary dysmenorrhea encountered in all prior
      studies indicated its potential value. This review presents the clinical
      recommendations for TENS parameters for treating primary dysmenorrhea symptoms
      based on previously published studies.

TI  - The INSPIRE Comparative Cost Study: 12-Month Health Economic and Clinical
      Outcomes Associated with Hysterectomy, Myomectomy, and Treatment with the Sonata 
      System.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Purpose: The INSPIRE study compared perioperative and 12-month health economic
      and clinical outcomes associated with hysterectomy, myomectomy, and
      sonography-guided transcervical fibroid ablation (TFA) using the Sonata® system. 
      Patients and Methods: Cost and health care resource utilization (HCRU) data for
      TFA were obtained from a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial.
      Data for hysterectomy and myomectomy arms were derived from the Truven Health
      MarketScan commercial payer claims database. The Truven data was used to
      determine health economic outcomes and costs for the hysterectomy and myomectomy 
      arms. For each arm, payer perspective costs were estimated from the available
      charge and HCRU data. Results: TFA with Sonata had significantly lower mean
      length of stay (LOS) of 5 hrs versus hysterectomy (73 hrs) or myomectomy (79 hrs;
      all p< 0.001). The average payer cost for TFA treatment, including the associated
      postoperative HCRU was $8,941. This was significantly lower compared to
      hysterectomy ($24,156) and myomectomy ($22,784; all p< 0.001). In the TFA arm,
      there were no device- or procedure-related costs associated with complications
      during the peri- or postoperative time frame. TFA subjects had significantly
      lower costs associated with complications, prescription medications, and
      radiology. Conclusion: Compared to hysterectomy and myomectomy, TFA treatment
      with the Sonata system was associated with significantly lower index procedure
      cost, complication cost, and LOS, contributing to a lower total payer cost
      through 12 months.

TI  - A multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial of rifampin to reduce pedal
      amputations for osteomyelitis in veterans with diabetes (VA INTREPID).
LID - 23
AB  - Background: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus continues to inexorably rise in
      the United States and throughout the world. Lower limb amputations are a
      devastating comorbid complication of diabetes mellitus. Osteomyelitis increases
      the risk of amputation fourfold and commonly presages death.Antimicrobial therapy
      for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) varies greatly, indicating that high
      quality data are needed to inform clinical decision making. Several small trials 
      have indicated that the addition of rifampin to backbone antimicrobial regimens
      for osteomyelitis outside the setting of the diabetic foot results in 28 to 42%
      higher cure rates. Methods/design: This is a prospective, randomized,
      double-blind investigation of the addition of 6 weeks of rifampin, 600 mg daily, 
      vs. matched placebo (riboflavin) to standard-of-care, backbone antimicrobial
      therapy for DFO. The study population are patients enrolled in Veteran Health
      Administration (VHA), ages ≥18 and ≤ 89 years with diabetes mellitus and definite
      or probable osteomyelitis of the foot for whom an extended course of oral or
      intravenous antibiotics is planned. The primary endpoint is amputation-free
      survival. The primary hypothesis is that using rifampin as adjunctive therapy
      will lower the hazard rate compared with the group that does not use rifampin as 
      adjunctive therapy. The primary hypothesis will be tested by means of a two-sided
      log-rank test with a 5% significance level. The test has 90% power to detect a
      hazard ratio of 0.67 or lower with a total of 880 study participants followed on 
      average for 1.8 years. Discussion: VA INTREPID will test if a rifampin-adjunctive
      antibiotic regimen increases amputation-free survival in patients seeking care in
      the VHA with DFO. A positive finding and its adoption by clinicians would reduce 
      lower extremity amputations and their associated physical and emotional impact
      and reduce mortality for Veterans and for the general population with diabetic
      foot osteomyelitis. Given that rifampin-adjunctive regimens are currently
      employed for therapy for the majority of DFO cases in Europe, and only in a small
      minority of cases in the United States, the trial results will impact therapeutic
      decisions, even if the null hypothesis is not rejected. Trial registration:
      Registered January 6, 2017 at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03012529.

TI  - Digital pills: a scoping review of the empirical literature and analysis of the
      ethical aspects.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: Digital Pills (DP) are an innovative drug-device technology that
      permits to combine traditional medications with a monitoring system that
      automatically records data about medication adherence as well as patients’
      physiological data. Although DP are a promising innovation in the field of
      digital medicine, their use has also raised a number of ethical concerns. These
      ethical concerns, however, have been expressed principally from a theoretical
      perspective, whereas an ethical analysis with a more empirically oriented
      approach is lacking. There is also a lack of clarity about the empirical evidence
      available concerning the application of this innovative digital medicine.
      Methods: To map the studies where DP have been tested on patients and discuss the
      ethically relevant issues evident therein, we performed a scoping review of the
      empirical literature concerning DP. Results: Our search allowed us to identify 18
      papers reporting on studies where DP were tested on patients. These included
      studies with different designs and involving patients with a variety of
      conditions. In the empirical literature, a number of issues with ethical
      relevance were evident. At the patient level, the ethical issues include users’
      interaction with DP, personal sphere, health-related risks and patients’
      benefits. At the provider level, ethically relevant issues touch upon the
      doctor-patient relationship and the question of data access. At the societal
      level, they concern the benefits to society, the quality of evidence and the
      dichotomy device-medicine. Conclusions: We conclude that evidence concerning DP
      is not robust and that more research should be performed and study results made
      available to evaluate this digital medicine. Moreover, our analysis of the
      ethically relevant aspects within empirical literature underscores that there are
      concrete and specific open questions that should be tackled in the ethical
      discussion about this new technological solution.

TI  - Comparison of effects and safety in providing controlled hypotension during
      surgery between dexmedetomidine and magnesium sulphate: A meta-analysis of
      randomized controlled trials.
LID - e0227410
AB  - Background: Effectiveness of controlled hypotension has been proven in
      alleviating intraoperative bleeding. Many recent studies emphasized the efficacy 
      of dexmedetomidine and magnesium in providing controlled hypotension during
      various surgeries. The present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs) was performed to evaluate comprehensively the effects and safety of these 
      two medications. Methods: Literature search was performed in four databases from 
      inception to April 2019. All RCTs that used dexmedetomidine and magnesium as
      hypotensive agents were enrolled. The outcomes contained bleeding condition of
      surgical site, hemodynamic parameters, duration of surgeries, number of patients 
      requiring opioid/analgesia administration, recovery period, and adverse events
      emerged during surgeries. Results: Ten studies with 663 patients met with our
      inclusion criteria. The results indicated that both bleeding score and values of 
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were significantly lower in
      patients receiving dexmedetomidine (SMD 1.65 with 95% CI [0.90,2.41], P<0.00001) 
      compared to the patients receiving magnesium. The effect in decreasing the
      necessity of using opioid/analgesia was affirmative in dexmedetomidine group
      (29.13% with magnesium vs 10.78% with dexmedetomidine), and the condition was
      more favorable in magnesium group in reducing recovery period (SMD -1.98 with 95%
      CI [-4.27,0.30], P = 0.09). Compared with magnesium, using of dexmedetomidine was
      associated with higher incidence of bradycardia but lower incidence of nausea and
      vomiting. Conclusion: Compared with magnesium, dexmedetomidine is more effective 
      to provide promising surgical field condition, favorable controlled hypotension, 
      and less necessity of opioid or analgesia administration. But long recovery
      period and high-probability bradycardia should be deliberated.

TI  - Anaphylaxis-Induced Atrial Fibrillation and Anesthesia: Pathophysiologic and
      Therapeutic Considerations.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in western society
      affecting more than 35 million individuals worldwide annually. It is a common
      postoperative complication and may also occur spontaneously during general and
      local anesthesia administration. Aging, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
      cardiovascular diseases including cardiomyopathies, congenital cardiac anomalies,
      heart failure, myocardial ischemia, pericarditis, previous cardiac surgery,
      vascular disease, and valvular heart disease are some correlated factors. Beyond 
      age, increased incidence of atrial fibrillation has been correlated to autoimmune
      system activation as it is the underlying mechanism of persistent atrial
      fibrillation development. Current research supports an association between the
      complement system activation and lymphocyte-pro-inflammatory cytokines release
      with the cardiac conduction system and atrial fibrosis. The loss of CD28 antigen 
      from CD4+ CD28+ T lymphocytes seems to play a major role in atrial fibrillation
      development and prognosis. Except atrial fibrillation, a variety of additional
      electrocardiographic changes, resembling those with digitalis intoxication may
      accompany anaphylaxis and particularly Kounis syndrome. Histamine is one
      well-known mediator in allergic and inflammatory conditions as physiologically
      regulates several cardiovascular and endothelial functions with arrhythmogenic
      potential. The increased oxidative stress, measured by the redox potentials of
      glutathione, has been correlated with atrial fibrillation incidence and
      prevalence. The use of antazoline, a first-generation antihistamine agent used
      for rapid conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with
      preserved left ventricular function and for rapid atrial fibrillation termination
      during accessory pathway ablation denotes that anaphylaxis-induced histamine
      production could be the cause of atrial fibrillation at least in some instances. 
      The anaphylaxis diagnosis in anesthesia can be challenging owing to the absence
      of cutaneous manifestetions such as flushing, urticaria, or angioedema.
      Anticoagulation for stroke prevention, rate and rhythm control medications,
      invasive methods such as radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation of pulmonary
      veins as well surgical ablation constitute the treatment basis of atrial
      fibrillation. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of atrial fibrillation by
      cardiologists, anesthesiologists and surgeons, as well as potential treatments,
      to optimize care is of paramount importance.

TI  - Enhanced Recovery and Early Extubation after Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Using
      Single-Dose Intravenous Methadone.
PG  - 70-4
AB  - Background/Aims:: Methadone may offer advantages in facilitating early extubation
      after cardiac surgery, but very few data are available in the pediatric
      population. Setting/Design:: Community tertiary children's hospital,
      retrospective case series. Materials and Methods:: We performed a retrospective
      analysis of all pediatric cardiac surgical patients for whom early extubation was
      intended. A multimodal analgesic regimen was used for all patients, consisting of
      methadone (0.2–0.3 mg/kg), ketamine (0.5 mg/kg plus 0.25 mg/kg/h), lidocaine (1
      mg/kg plus 1.5 mg/kg/h), acetaminophen (15 mg/kg), and parasternal ropivacaine
      (0.5 mL/kg of 0.2%). Outcome variables were collected with descriptive
      statistics. Results:: A total of 24 children [median = 7 (interquartile range =
      3.75–13.75) years old, 23.7 (14.8–53.4) kg] were included in the study; 22 (92%) 
      had procedures performed on bypass and 11 (46%) involved a reentry sternotomy.
      Methadone dosing was 0.26 (0.23–0.29) mg/kg. None of the children required
      intraoperative supplemental opioids; 23 (96%) were extubated in the operating
      room. The first paCO2 on pediatric intensive care unit admission was 51 (45–58)
      mmHg. Time to first supplemental opioid administration was 5.1 (3.5–9.5) h.
      Cumulative total supplemental opioids (in intravenous morphine equivalents) at 24
      and 72 h were 0.2 (0.09–0.32) and 0.42 (0.27–0.68) mg/kg. One child required
      postoperative bilevel positive airway pressure support, but none required
      reintubation. None had pruritus; three (13%) experienced nausea. Conclusion:: A
      methadone-based multimodal regimen facilitated early extubation without
      appreciable adverse events. Further investigations are needed to confirm efficacy
      of this regimen and to assess whether the excellent safety profile seen here
      holds in the hands of multiple providers caring for a larger, more heterogeneous 
      population.

TI  - Long-Term Trends in Postoperative Opioid Prescribing, 1994 to 2014.
LID - e19.00171
AB  - Opioids are routinely prescribed to manage acute postoperative pain, but changes 
      in postoperative opioid prescribing associated with the marketing of long-acting 
      opioids such as OxyContin have not been described in the surgical
      cohort.Methods:: Using a large commercial claims data set, we studied
      postoperative opioid prescribing after selected common surgical procedures
      between 1994 and 2014. For each procedure and year, we calculated the mean
      postoperative morphine milligram equivalents (MME) filled on the index
      prescription and assessed the proportion of patients who filled a high-dose
      prescription (≥350 MME). We reported changes in postoperative opioid prescribing 
      over time and identified predictors of filling a high-dose postoperative opioid
      prescription. Results:: We identified 1,321,264 adult patients undergoing
      selected common surgical procedures between 1994 and 2014, of whom 80.3% filled a
      postoperative opioid prescription. One in five surgery patients filled a
      high-dose postoperative opioid prescription. Between 1994 and 2014, the mean MME 
      filled increased by 145%, 84%, and 85% for lumbar laminectomy/laminotomy, total
      knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty, respectively. The procedures most 
      likely to be associated with a high-dose opioid fill were all orthopaedic
      procedures (AOR 5.20 to 7.55, P < 0.001 for all). Patients whose postoperative
      opioid prescription included a long-acting formulation had the highest odds of
      filling a prescription that exceeded 350 MME (AOR 32.01, 95% CI, 30.23–33.90).
      Discussion:: After the US introduction of long-acting opioids such as OxyContin, 
      postoperative opioid prescribing in commercially insured patients increased in
      parallel with broader US opioid-prescribing trends, most notably among patients
      undergoing orthopaedic surgical procedures. The increase in the mean annual MME
      filled starting in the late 1990s was driven in part by the higher proportion of 
      long-acting opioid formulations on the index postoperative opioid prescription
      filled by orthopaedic surgery patients.

TI  - A Case of Kratom-induced Seizures.
LID - e6588
AB  - Kratom or Mitragna speciosa is a tropical tree that is indigenous to Southeast
      Asia, where it has been used for various medicinal reasons. In the West, it is
      used in the self-treatment of opioid withdrawal, pain, and a variety of mood and 
      anxiety states. Two active ingredients in kratom are mitragynine and
      7-hydroxymitragynine, which have affinity at the mu-opioid receptor among others.
      Kratom is easily available over the Internet and its use is increasing in the
      United States. It is currently listed by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a
      drug of concern. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration started issuing a
      series of warnings about kratom, and by early 2018, it released a statement
      identifying 44 deaths related to kratom use. The Centers for Disease Control and 
      Prevention has also reported 91 deaths directly linked to kratom use in 2019.
      Although its safety profile needs additional research for clarification, there
      have been reports of kratom-induced or kratom-related respiratory depression,
      hypothyroidism, secondary hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, psychosis, and
      seizures. We report a case of kratom-induced tonic-clonic seizures in a
      27-year-old Caucasian male with a psychiatric history of anxiety,
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine use disorder, and opioid
      use disorder. He was hospitalized after a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure. There
      was no significant metabolic abnormality on laboratory testing. Spinal cord and
      brain imaging were unremarkable, whereas his urine toxicology was positive for
      opioids only, which was likely a false-positive result due to cross-reactivity
      with his sleeping aids. He was evaluated by the Consultation-Liaison
      Psychiatry team for psychotic symptoms. On evaluation, the patient’s psychosis
      had resolved, but he endorsed racing thoughts, significant anxiety, and insomnia.
      He admitted to drinking three to four 8-mL bottles of Kratom daily for
      one-and-a-half years to self-medicate his anxiety after losing his health
      insurance. In the hospital, he was treated with anxiolytics, counseled to abstain
      from Kratom use, and was referred for substance use disorder treatment. This case
      highlights the life-threatening complications of Kratom that is easily available 
      online.

TI  - Respiratory Rate Monitoring in Clinical Environments with a Contactless
      Ultra-Wideband Impulse Radar-based Sensor System.
PG  - 3366-75
AB  - Respiratory rate is an extremely important but poorly monitored vital sign for
      medical conditions. Current modalities for respiratory monitoring are suboptimal.
      This paper presents a proof of concept of a new algorithm using a contactless
      ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radar-based sensor to detect respiratory rate in
      both a laboratory setting and in a two-subject case study in the Emergency
      Department. This novel approach has shown correlation with manual respiratory
      rate in the laboratory setting and shows promise in Emergency Department
      subjects. In order to improve respiratory rate monitoring, the UWB technology is 
      also able to localize subject movement throughout the room. This technology has
      potential for utilization both in and out of the hospital environments to improve
      monitoring and to prevent morbidity and mortality from a variety of medical
      conditions associated with changes in respiratory rate.

TI  - No Differences in the Prevalence and Intensity of Chronic Postsurgical Pain
      Between Laparoscopic Hysterectomy and Abdominal Hysterectomy: A Prospective
      Study.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Objective: To compare the prevalence and characteristics of chronic postsurgical 
      pain (CPSP) between laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) and abdominal hysterectomy
      (AH) groups 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, and to assess the impact of pain
      on the activities of daily living (ADL) of patients. Methods: The demographic
      characteristics, intraoperative clinical factors, and postoperative pain score
      were collected prospectively in patients scheduled for elective LH or AH for
      benign disease at our institution from July 2014 to June 2015. Patients were
      interviewed by telephone and followed up for pain assessment 3, 6, and 12 months 
      after surgery. The prevalence, intensity, and specific locations of pain, as well
      as analgesic administration and impact on the ADL, were included in the
      questionnaire. Results: The results from 406 patients (225 patients in the LH
      group and 181 patients in the AH group) were obtained. Three months after
      surgery, the prevalence of CPSP was 20.9% in the LH group and 20.4% in the AH
      group. At 6 months, the prevalence of pain declined to 11.6% in the LH group and 
      9.4% in the AH group. At 12 months after surgery, only 13 (5.8%) patients in the 
      LH group and 11 (6.1%) patients in the AH group complained about persistent pain.
      The prevalence of CPSP, as well as the average numerical rating scale pain scores
      at rest and during movement, during 12 months after surgery were not
      significantly different between the groups. CPSP after hysterectomy exhibited a
      negative impact on the ADL. Conclusion: The prevalence and intensity of CPSP were
      not significantly different between patients undergoing LH or AH within 12 months
      after surgery. A tendency towards a reduction in chronic pain over time was
      documented. Chronic post-hysterectomy pain exhibited a negative impact on the
      ADL.

TI  - EEG alpha activity increased in response to transcutaneous electrical nervous
      stimulation in young healthy subjects but not in the healthy elderly.
LID - e8330
AB  - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is used not only in the
      treatment of pain but also in the examination of sensory functions. With aging,
      there is decreased sensitivity to somatosensory stimuli. It is essential to
      examine the effect of TENS application on the sensory functions in the brain by
      recording the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and the effect of
      aging on the sensory functions of the brain during the application. The present
      study aimed to investigate the effect of the application of TENS on the brain’s
      electrical activity and the effect of aging on the sensory functions of the brain
      during application of TENS. A total of 15 young (24.2 ± 3.59) and 14 elderly
      (65.64 ± 4.92) subjects were included in the study. Spontaneous EEG was recorded 
      from 32 channels during TENS application. Power spectrum analysis was performed
      by Fast Fourier Transform in the alpha frequency band (8–13 Hz) for all subjects.
      Repeated measures of analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis (p < 
      0.05). Young subjects had increased alpha power during the TENS application and
      had gradually increased alpha power by increasing the current intensity of TENS
      (p = 0.035). Young subjects had higher alpha power than elderly subjects in the
      occipital and parietal locations (p = 0.073). We can, therefore, conclude that
      TENS indicated increased alpha activity in young subjects. Young subjects had
      higher alpha activity than elderly subjects in the occipital and somatosensory
      areas. To our knowledge, the present study is one of the first studies examining 
      the effect of TENS on spontaneous EEG in healthy subjects. Based on the results
      of the present study, TENS may be used as an objective method for the examination
      of sensory impairments, and in the evaluative efficiency of the treatment of pain
      conditions.

TI  - Toward precision adjuvants: optimizing science and safety.
PG  - 125-38
AB  - Purpose of review: The gradual replacement of inactivated whole cell and live
      attenuated vaccines with subunit vaccines has generally reduced reactogenicity
      but in many cases also immunogenicity. Although only used when necessary,
      adjuvants can be key to vaccine dose/antigen-sparing, broadening immune responses
      to variable antigens, and enhancing immunogenicity in vulnerable populations with
      distinct immunity. Licensed vaccines contain an increasing variety of adjuvants, 
      with a growing pipeline of adjuvanted vaccines under development. Recent
      findings: Most adjuvants, including Alum, Toll-like receptor agonists and
      oil-in-water emulsions, activate innate immunity thereby altering the quantity
      and quality of an adaptive immune response. Adjuvants activate leukocytes, and
      induce mediators (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandin-E2) some of
      which are biomarkers for reactogenicity, that is, induction of local/systemic
      side effects. Although there have been safety concerns regarding a hypothetical
      risk of adjuvants inducing auto-immunity, such associations have not been
      established. As immune responses vary by population (e.g., age and sex), adjuvant
      research now incorporates principles of precision medicine. Innovations in
      adjuvant research include use of human in vitro models, immuno-engineering, novel
      delivery systems, and systems biology to identify biomarkers of safety and
      adjuvanticity. Summary: Adjuvants enhance vaccine immunogenicity and can be
      associated with reactogenicity. Novel multidisciplinary approaches hold promise
      to accelerate and de-risk targeted adjuvant discovery and development. Video

TI  - Review of adjuvants to local anesthetics in peripheral nerve blocks: Current and 
      future trends.
PG  - 77-84
AB  - In recent anesthetic practice, peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) are used
      extensively for surgical anesthesia and nonsurgical analgesia. PNBs offer many
      benefits over other anesthetic techniques in a certain population of patients,
      and in some specific clinical setting, that may contribute to faster and safer
      pain relief, increased patient satisfaction, reduced hospital stay, and decreased
      overall healthcare cost. The technique involves the injection of the anesthetic
      in the vicinity of a specific nerve or bundle of nerves to block the sensation of
      pain transmitting to a specific portion of the body. However, the length of
      analgesia when a single anesthetic is used for PNB may not last long. Therefore, 
      the practice of adding an additional agent called adjuvant has been evolved to
      prolong the analgesic effect. There are many such adjuvants available that are
      clinically being used for this purpose imparting great efficacy and safety to the
      anesthetic process. The adjuvants molecules are generally classified as opioids, 
      alpha-2 agonist, steroids, etc. Most of them are safe to use and show little or
      no adverse event related to neurotoxicity and tissue damage. Although there is
      extensive use of such adjuvants in the clinical field, none of the molecules is
      approved by the FDA and is used as an off-label drug. The risk to benefit ratio
      must be assessed while using such an agent. This review will try to delineate the
      basic need of adjuvant in peripheral nerve block and will discuss the advantages 
      and limitations of using different adjuvants and will discuss the future prospect
      of such application.

TI  - Efficacy of single-shot ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block for
      postoperative analgesia after mastectomy: A randomized controlled study.
PG  - 22-7
AB  - Background:: The aim of this study is to understand the effect of ultrasound (US)
      guided erector spinae plane block (ESPB) in improving the intraoperative and
      postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing mastectomies, decreasing the use
      of opioids and in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting. Methods:: After
      local ethics committee approval, 100 patients were divided randomly into two
      groups. Group A with 50 patients received US guided ESPB with 30 ml of 0.25% of
      bupivacaine under US guidance. Group B with 50 patients received no block. Visual
      analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess pain postoperatively. All patients
      received 1 g intravenous intravenous paracetamol 8th hourly and morphine was used
      as rescue analgesia if VAS score is more than 4. Patients were monitored for VAS 
      scores, postoperative nausea/ vomiting and total morphine consumption for a
      24-hour period in a high dependency unit. Results:: Postoperative morphine
      consumption was found to be significantly less in patients who received US-guided
      ESPB compared to control group (0.12 mg ± 0.59 mg in ESPB group compared to 1.70 
      ± 2.29 mg which was statistically significant, p=0.000). Only 3 patients in ESP
      group received rescue analgesia in the form of morphine whereas 22 patients in
      the control group received morphine. There was no difference in PONV score in
      either groups. There were no complications like vascular puncture, pneumothorax, 
      or respiratory depression in both groups. Conclusion:: US guided ESPB is quite
      effective in reducing perioperative pain in patients undergoing mastectomy. The
      trial was registered prospectively with CTRI with registration number:
      CTRI/2018/09/015668.

TI  - Circadian disruption of core body temperature in trauma patients: a single-center
      retrospective observational study.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: Circadian clock alterations were poorly reported in trauma patients, 
      although they have a critical role in human physiology. Core body temperature is 
      a clinical variable regulated by the circadian clock. Our objective was to
      identify the circadian temperature disruption in trauma patients and to determine
      whether these disruptions were associated with the 28-day mortality rate.
      Methods: A retrospective and observational single-center cohort study was
      conducted. All adult severe trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit
      of Aix Marseille University, North Hospital, from November 2013 to February 2018,
      were evaluated. The variations of core body temperature for each patient were
      analyzed between days 2 and 3 after intensive care unit admission. Core body
      temperature variations were defined by three parameters: mesor, amplitude, and
      period. A logistic regression model was used to determine the variables
      influencing these three parameters. A survival analysis was performed assessing
      the association between core body temperature rhythm disruption and 28-day
      mortality rate. A post hoc subgroup analysis focused on the patients with head
      trauma. Results: Among the 1584 screened patients, 248 were included in this
      study. The period differed from 24 h in 177 (71%) patients. The mesor value (°C) 
      was associated with body mass index and ketamine use. Amplitude (°C) was
      associated with ketamine use only. The 28-day mortality rate was 18%. For all
      trauma patients, age, body mass index, intracranial hypertension, and amplitude
      were independent risk factors. The patients with a mesor value < 36.9 °C
      (p < 0.001) and an amplitude > 0.6 °C (p < 0.001) had a higher 28-day mortality
      rate. Among the patients with head trauma, mesor and amplitude were identified as
      independent risk factors (HR = 0.40, 95% CI [0.23–0.70], p = 0.001 and HR = 4.73,
      95% CI [1.38–16.22], p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our results highlight an association
      between core body temperature circadian alteration and 28-day mortality rate.
      This association was more pronounced in the head trauma patients than in the
      non-head trauma patients. Further studies are needed to show a causal link and
      consider possible interventions.

TI  - Pharmacological conditioning in the treatment of recent-onset rheumatoid
      arthritis: a randomized controlled trial study protocol.
LID - 15
AB  - Background: In pharmacological conditioning associations are formed between the
      effects of medication and contextual factors related to the medication.
      Pharmacological conditioning with placebo medication can result in comparable
      treatment effects and reduced side effects compared to regular treatment in
      various clinical populations, and may be applied to achieve enhanced drug
      effects. In the current study protocol, pharmacological conditioning is applied
      to achieve enhanced treatment effects in patients with recent-onset rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). The results from this study broaden the knowledge on the
      potential of pharmacological conditioning and provide a potential innovative
      treatment option to optimize long-term pharmacological treatment effectiveness
      for patients with inflammatory conditions, such as recent-onset RA. Methods: A
      multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial is conducted in patients with
      recent-onset RA. Participants start on standardized pharmacological treatment for
      16 weeks, which consists of methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg/week and a tapered schedule 
      of prednisone 60 mg or 30 mg. After 4 months, participants in clinical remission 
      (based on the rheumatologist’s opinion and a targeted score below 1.6 on a
      44-joint disease activity score (DAS44)) are randomized to 1 of 2 groups: (1) the
      control group (C), which continues with a standardized treatment schedule of MTX 
      15 mg/week or (2) the pharmacological conditioning group (PC), which receives an 
      MTX treatment schedule in alternating high and low dosages. In the case of
      persistent clinical remission after 8 months, treatment is tapered and
      discontinued linearly in the C group and variably in the PC group. Both groups
      receive the same cumulative amount of MTX during each period. Logistic regression
      analysis is used to compare the proportion of participants with drug-free
      clinical remission after 12 months between the C group and the PC group.
      Secondary outcome measures include clinical functioning, laboratory assessments, 
      and self-reported measures after each 4-month period up to 18 months after study 
      start. Discussion: The results from this study broaden the knowledge on the
      potential of pharmacological conditioning and provide a potential innovative
      treatment option to optimize long-term pharmacological treatment effectiveness in
      patients with inflammatory conditions, such as recent-onset RA. Trial

TI  - Potential of animal models for advancing the understanding and treatment of pain 
      in Parkinson’s disease.
LID - 1
AB  - Pain is a commonly occurring non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD).
      Treatment of pain in PD remains less than optimal and a better understanding of
      the underlying mechanisms would facilitate discovery of improved analgesics.
      Animal models of PD have already proven helpful for furthering the understanding 
      and treatment of motor symptoms of PD, but could these models offer insight into 
      pain in PD? This review addresses the current position regarding pain in
      preclinical models of PD, covering the face and predictive validity of existing
      models and their use so far in advancing understanding of the mechanisms
      contributing to pain in PD. While pain itself is not usually measured in animals,
      nociception in the form of thermal, mechanical or chemical nociceptive thresholds
      offers a useful readout, given reduced nociceptive thresholds are commonly seen
      in PD patients. Animal models of PD including the reserpine-treated rat and
      neurodegenerative models such as the MPTP-treated mouse and 6-hydroxydopamine
      (6-OHDA)-treated rat each exhibit reduced nociceptive thresholds, supporting face
      validity of these models. Furthermore, some interventions known clinically to
      relieve pain in PD, such as dopaminergic therapies and deep brain stimulation of 
      the subthalamic nucleus, restore nociceptive thresholds in one or more models,
      supporting their predictive validity. Mechanistic insight gained already includes
      involvement of central and spinal dopamine and opioid systems. Moving forward,
      these preclinical models should advance understanding of the cellular and
      molecular mechanisms underlying pain in PD and provide test beds for examining
      the efficacy of novel analgesics to better treat this debilitating non-motor
      symptom.

TI  - A cross sectional study to determine the prevalence of cough and its impact in
      patients with lung cancer: a patient unmet need.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: There is absence of literature related to cough prevalence and its
      characteristics in lung cancer patients, with information deriving only from
      broader symptoms occurrence studies. The aims of this study were to provide a
      snapshot of the prevalence of all-cause-cough in lung cancer patients and to
      characterise cough in terms of its impact and severity. Methods: A
      cross-sectional study recruiting consecutive lung cancer patients over a
      pre-defined period of time and using cough-specific validated tools in a tertiary
      referral centre in the UK, including a cough severity VAS and the Manchester
      Cough in Lung Cancer scale (MCLCS). Results: Data was collected from 202
      patients. All-cause cough prevalence was 57% (through VAS) both in the screened
      (N = 223) and research (N = 202) population or 67% (through the MCLCS), and cough
      severity was moderate at a mean of 32 mm (in a 100 mm VAS). Age, sex, smoking
      status, lung cancer histology, stage and comorbidities were not associated with
      cough prevalence. The only variable associated with lower cough reports was being
      ‘on anticancer treatment’; fewer patients on treatment reported a cough (40%)
      compared to those off treatment (54%) (p = 0.04). The impact of cough (as
      measured by MCLCS) was also significant (mean score = 22). About 18% of patients 
      felt moderate/severe distress from their cough and about 15% often or always
      reported disturbed sleep due to coughing. Half the patients felt their cough
      warranted treatment. Conclusions: Cough is a common symptom in lung cancer with
      considerable impact on patients’ lives. Cough presence and severity should
      regularly be assessed in clinical practice. There is an urgent need to focus on
      developing more potent antitussive treatments and improve the management of this 
      complex and distressing symptom.

TI  - Opioid use is associated with incomplete capsule endoscopy examinations: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 5
AB  - Background: Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive imaging modality designed to
      evaluate various small bowel pathologies. Failure to reach the cecum within the
      battery lifespan, termed incomplete examination, may result in inadequate testing
      and possibly delayed therapy. Several studies have attempted to evaluate the
      association between CE completion and opioid use. However, their results are
      conflicting. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the previously
      published literature on the association between opioid use and CE completion.
      Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, PubMed
      Central, Embase, and ScienceDirect databases from inception through June 1, 2018,
      to identify all studies that evaluated the association between CE completion and 
      opioid use. We included studies that presented an odds ratio (OR) with a 95%
      confidence interval (CI) or presented the data sufficient to calculate the OR
      with a 95% CI. Statistical analysis was performed using the comprehensive
      meta-analysis (CMA), version 3 software. Results: Five studies with a total of
      1,614 patients undergoing CE in the inpatient (IP) and outpatient (OP) setting
      were included in this study, 349 of which had an incomplete CE (21.6%). The
      pooled OR for CE completion is 0.50 (95% CI: 0.38–0.66, I2=36.9%) in opioid users
      compared to non-users. No publication bias was found using Egger’s regression
      test. Conclusions: Our results indicate that patients on opioids are
      significantly less likely to have a complete CE examination compared to
      non-users. To our knowledge, this study represents the first meta-analysis to
      assess this association.

TI  - Botulinum Neurotoxins and Cancer—A Review of the Literature.
LID - 32
AB  - Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) possess an analgesic effect through several
      mechanisms including an inhibition of acetylcholine release from the
      neuromuscular junction as well as an inhibition of specific pain transmitters and
      mediators. Animal studies have shown that a peripheral injection of BoNTs impairs
      the release of major pain transmitters such as substance P, calcitonin gene
      related peptide (CGRP) and glutamate from peripheral nerve endings as well as
      peripheral and central neurons (dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord). These
      effects lead to pain relief via the reduction of peripheral and central
      sensitization both of which reflect important mechanisms of pain chronicity. This
      review provides updated information about the effect of botulinum toxin injection
      on local pain caused by cancer, painful muscle spasms from a remote cancer, and
      pain at the site of cancer surgery and radiation. The data from the literature
      suggests that the local injection of BoNTs improves muscle spasms caused by
      cancerous mass lesions and alleviates the post-operative neuropathic pain at the 
      site of surgery and radiation. It also helps repair the parotid damage (fistula, 
      sialocele) caused by facial surgery and radiation and improves post-parotidectomy
      gustatory hyperhidrosis. The limited literature that suggests adding botulinum
      toxins to cell culture slows/halts the growth of certain cancer cells is also
      reviewed and discussed.

TI  - Mu Opioid Receptor 1 (MOR-1) Expression in Colorectal Cancer and Oncological
      Long-Term Outcomes: A Five-Year Retrospective Longitudinal Cohort Study.
LID - 134
AB  - Preclinical evidence has shown increased expression of mu opioid receptor 1
      (MOR-1) in colorectal cancer although its association with disease-free and
      overall survival (DFS and OS) has not been investigated. We hypothesized that
      MOR-1 was overexpressed in tumor samples compared to normal tissue and this was
      associated with decreased DFS and OS. We carried out a retrospective study
      assessing the association of MOR-1 tumor expression with long-term outcomes by
      immunohistochemistry in normal and tumor samples from 174 colorectal cancer
      patients. The primary endpoint was five years of DFS. Secondary endpoints were
      five years of OS, the difference in MOR-1 expression between normal and tumor
      tissue and the occurrence of postoperative complications. Multivariable Cox
      regression showed no significant association between MOR-1 expression and DFS (HR
      0.791, 95% CI 0.603–1.039, p = 0.092). MOR-1 expression was higher in tumor
      tissue compared to non-tumor tissue. No associations were found between MOR-1
      expression and OS or postoperative complications. These findings suggest that
      although MOR-1 is over-expressed in colorectal cancer samples there is no
      association to increased risk of recurrence or mortality. Future studies are
      warranted to elucidate the role of cancer stage, genetic polymorphism, and
      quantitative assessment of MOR-1 over-expression on long-term outcomes in
      colorectal cancer.

TI  - The association between genome‐wide polymorphisms and chronic postoperative pain:
      a prospective observational study.
PG  - e111-20
AB  - Chronic postoperative pain is common and can have a negative impact on quality of
      life. Recent studies show that genetic risk factors are likely to play a role,
      although only gene‐targeted analysis has been used to date. This is the first
      genome‐wide association study to identify single‐nucleotide polymorphisms
      associated with the development of chronic postoperative pain based on two
      independent cohorts. In a discovery cohort, 330 women scheduled for hysterectomy 
      were genotyped. A case–control association analysis compared patients without
      chronic postoperative pain and the 34 who had severe chronic postoperative pain
      3 months after surgery. No single‐nucleotide polymorphisms reached genome‐wide
      significance, but several showed suggestive associations with chronic
      postoperative pain (p < 1 × 10−5). Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms with
      significance p < 1 × 10−5 were followed up in a replication cohort consisting of 
      203 men and women scheduled for orthopaedic or abdominal surgery. Ten of these
      patients developed severe chronic postoperative pain. A single‐nucleotide
      polymorphism in NAV3 was significantly replicated with chronic postoperative pain
      in the replication cohort (p = 0.009). Meta‐analysis revealed that two loci
      (IQGAP1 and CRTC3) were significantly associated with chronic postoperative pain 
      at 3 months (IQGAP1 p = 3.93 × 10−6 β = 2.3863, CRTC3 p = 2.26 × 10−6,
      β = 2.4209). The present genome‐wide association study provides initial evidence 
      for genetic risk factors of chronic postoperative pain and supports follow‐up
      studies.

TI  - The analgesic efficacy and safety of peri-articular injection versus
      intra-articular injection in one-stage bilateral total knee arthroplasty: a
      randomized controlled trial.
LID - 2
AB  - Background: As an essential component of multimodal analgesia approaches after
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA), local infiltration analgesia (LIA) can be
      classified into peri-articular injection (PAI) and intra-articular injection
      (IAI) according to administration techniques. Currently, there is no definite
      answer to the optimal choice between the two techniques. Our study aims to
      investigate analgesic efficacy and safety of PAI versus IAI in patients receiving
      simultaneous bilateral TKA. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was
      conducted from February 2017 and finished in July 2018. Sixty patients eligible
      for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to
      receive PAI on one side and IAI on another. Primary outcomes included numerical
      rating scale (NRS) pain score at rest or during activity at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h,
      48 h, and 72 h following surgery. Secondary outcomes contained active or passive 
      range of motion (ROM) at 1, 2, and 3 days after surgery, time to perform straight
      leg raise, wound drainage, operation time, and wound complications. Results:
      Patients experienced lower NRS pain scores of the knee receiving PAI compared
      with that with PAI during the first 48 h after surgery. The largest difference of
      NRS pain score at rest occurred at 48 h (PAI: 0.68, 95%CI[0.37, 0.98]; IAI: 2.63,
      95%CI [2.16, 3.09]; P < 0.001); and the largest difference of NRS pain score
      during activity also took place at 48 h (PAI: 2.46, 95%CI [2.07, 2.85]; IAI:
      3.90, 95%CI [3.27, 4.52]; P = 0.001). PAI group had better results of range of
      motion and time to perform straight leg raise when compared with IAI group. There
      were no differences in operation time, wound drainage, and wound complication.
      Conclusion: PAI had the superior performance of pain relief and improvement of
      range of motion to IAI. Therefore, the administration technique of peri-articular
      injection is recommended when performing local infiltration analgesia after total
      knee arthroplasty. Trial registration: The trial was retrospectively registered
      in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry as ChiCTR1800020420 on 29th December,
      2018. Level of evidence: Therapeutic Level I.

TI  - Adenotonsillectomy and postoperative respiratory adverse events: A retrospective 
      study.
PG  - 168-74
AB  - Objectives: Postoperative respiratory adverse events (PRAEs) are known
      complications following adenotonsillectomy (AT). Clinical data at a single
      institution were reviewed to investigate the factors that may contribute to PRAEs
      in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). The relationship between PRAEs in the
      PACU and escalation of care, defined as either an unplanned admission for
      outpatient surgery or unplanned pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission,
      was investigated. Methods: The perioperative records for all patients who
      underwent AT from 2016 to 2018 were reviewed. The surgical procedure was
      performed at both the main campus and the ambulatory surgery center in accordance
      with the institutional obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) guidelines. Patient
      characteristics and intraoperative medications were compared. Categorical
      variables were summarized as counts with percentages and compared using
      chi‐square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Continuous variables were summarized as
      medians with interquartile ranges and compared using rank‐sum tests.
      Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of
      intraoperative dosing with the occurrence of PRAEs. Results: The study cohort
      included 6110 patients. Ninety‐three patients (2%) experienced PRAEs in the PACU.
      Of these 93 patients, 14 (15%) resulted in an escalation of care, nearly all of
      which were unplanned PICU admissions. PRAEs tended to occur in younger patients, 
      non‐Hispanic black patients, and those with a higher American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) status. Conclusions: PRAEs are infrequent after AT at a
      tertiary institution with OSA guidelines in place. However, when PRAEs do occur, 
      escalation of care may be required. Risk factors include age, ethnic background, 
      and ASA physical status. Level of Evidence: III.

      or notable differences between cruciate-retaining and posterior-stabilized total 
      knee designs in terms of clinical outcomes and survivorship. Medial pivot designs
      theoretically recreate more normal knee kinematics compared with
      cruciate-retaining or posterior-stabilized designs, although superiority has not 
      yet been clearly demonstrated and additional long-term data is necessary,
      particularly for survivorship. Conclusions:: By analyzing the results of the
      aforementioned studies, surgeons can implement the most up-to-date evidence-based
      care when doing total knee arthroplasty surgery. However, many of these selected 
      topics continue to have a component of ongoing controversy with no definitive
      conclusions developed in recent literature.

LID - e19.00047
AB  - This review article examines updates to the literature during the past 5 years on
      numerous topics related to total knee arthroplasty which were felt to have
      ongoing controversy. These include the use of peripheral nerve blocks and local
      infiltrative analgesia, intrathecal morphine, patellar resurfacing, and bearing

TI  - Comparison of effectiveness and safety between epidural anesthesia vs local
      anesthesia for percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy: A systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
LID - e18629
AB  - Objectives:: To compare the effectiveness and safety of epidural anesthesia (EA) 
      with those of local anesthesia (LA) for percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic
      discectomy (PTED) and provide reference data for clinical decision-making.
      Methods:: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, Web of Science,
      Medline, ScienceDirect, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure from
      inception to June 2019 in order to identify randomized and nonrandomized
      controlled trials comparing EA and LA for PTED. Studies assessing at least 2 of
      the following indicators were eligible: surgical duration, X-ray exposure time,
      satisfaction rate, visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, Oswestry Disability
      Index (ODI), and complications. Two assessors evaluated the quality of the
      literature using the Cochrane Handbook or Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis
      was conducted using Review Manager 5.3.3 software. Results:: Four randomized
      controlled trials and 4 retrospective cohort studies involving a total of 1000
      patients were included. The LA and EA groups included 473 and 527 patients,
      respectively. Meta-analysis revealed significant intergroup differences in the
      intraoperative (P < .00001) and postoperative (P < .00001) lumbar VAS scores,
      intraoperative (P < .00001) and postoperative (P = .001) leg VAS scores, and
      anesthesia satisfaction rate (P < .00001), with EA being superior to LA in all
      aspects. There were no significant intergroup differences in the surgical
      duration, X-ray exposure time, postoperative ODI, and complication rate.
      Conclusion:: EA is as safe as LA and produces better anesthetic effects than does
      LA in patients undergoing PTED. Therefore, it should be promoted as a reliable
      anesthetic technique for PTED.

TI  - Malfunctioning sufentanil intrathecal pain pump: a case report.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: Sufentanil is a potent opioid uncommonly used to manage pain and is
      rarely administered via an intrathecal pain pump system. Case presentation: This 
      case illustrates the use of intrathecal sufentanil in a 50-year-old Caucasian man
      for the management of chronic pain; however, the intrathecal drug delivery system
      experienced a malfunction which led to 1/100th output of the correct dosage.
      Interesting aspects of this case report include the uncommon choice of sufentanil
      use for an intrathecal drug delivery system, as well as the unusual
      pharmacokinetics of this drug. Specifically, this patient did not experience the 
      major withdrawal that would be expected given significant under dosing of opioid,
      and this may be explained by the lipophilicity and context-sensitive half-times
      of sufentanil. Conclusions: Because of the absence of a clinically significant
      withdrawal in this case report, clinicians must be aware of relevant
      pharmacokinetic properties and unusual intrathecal drug delivery system
      technologies that influence a patient’s response when device malfunction occurs.

TI  - A rapid positive influence of S-ketamine on the anxiety of patients in palliative
      care: a retrospective pilot study.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: Patients in palliative care need rapid-acting pharmacological options
      for psychological distress. N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine is known to 
      have a fast onset of anti-depressant and anxiolytic action. Its S-enantiomer
      S-ketamine (or esketamine) is an analgesic used as a routine treatment for
      refractory pain as an intravenous infusion (0.25 mg/kg over 45 min). This study
      investigates whether S-ketamine pain therapy has a positive impact on
      psychological distress caused by anxiety and depression in palliative care.
      Methods: Patient routine data from a palliative care unit of a tertiary care
      hospital were used in a retrospective analysis after positive ethics approval.
      Eight patients, who received analgesic S-ketamine treatment, were compared to a
      control group matched by gender and age. The main analysis was conducted using
      three-way mixed MANOVA followed by two-way mixed ANOVA. Target variables were the
      values for anxiety and depression in the state-trait anxiety-depression inventory
      STADI. The predictor variables were the time of measurement before (T1) and after
      (T2) S-ketamine application and group membership. Results: Comparison of the
      S-ketamine group (n = 8; 4 male, 4 female; average age 52 years) with the control
      group (n = 8; 3 male, 5 female; average age 55 years) revealed a significant
      multivariate effect on anxiety and depression F(1, 14) = 4.78; p = 0.046;
      r = 0.50. The univariate comparisons showed a significant reduction of the
      anxiety scores from T1 to T2 in the S-ketamine group compared to the control
      group F(1, 14) = 10.14; p = 0.007; r = 0.65. With regard to depression, there was
      no significant reduction from T1 to T2 in the group comparison F(1, 14) = 1.60;
      p = 0.23; r = 0.32. No long-lasting effects on pain were found. Conclusions: Our 
      findings show that psychological distress of patients in palliative care may
      improve after a single administration of S-ketamine, which mainly alleviates
      anxiety in those patients. Limitations of this study arise from
      non-randomization, retrospective analysis and low sample size. Therefore, further
      prospective and ideally randomized studies are necessary.

TI  - Cannabinoids and Opioids in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
LID - e00120
AB  - In traditional medicine, Cannabis sativa has been prescribed for a variety of
      diseases. Today, the plant is largely known for its recreational purpose, but it 
      may find a way back to what it was originally known for: a herbal remedy. Most of
      the plant's ingredients, such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol,
      cannabigerol, and others, have demonstrated beneficial effects in preclinical
      models of intestinal inflammation. Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids)
      have shown a regulatory role in inflammation and mucosal permeability of the
      gastrointestinal tract where they likely interact with the gut microbiome.
      Anecdotal reports suggest that in humans, Cannabis exerts antinociceptive,
      anti-inflammatory, and antidiarrheal properties. Despite these reports, strong
      evidence on beneficial effects of Cannabis in human gastrointestinal diseases is 
      lacking. Clinical trials with Cannabis in patients suffering from inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) have shown improvement in quality of life but failed to
      provide evidence for a reduction of inflammation markers. Within the endogenous
      opioid system, mu opioid receptors may be involved in anti-inflammation of the
      gut. Opioids are frequently used to treat abdominal pain in IBD; however, heavy
      opioid use in IBD is associated with opioid dependency and higher mortality. This
      review highlights latest advances in the potential treatment of IBD using
      Cannabis/cannabinoids or opioids.

TI  - The Evolving Microbiome from Pregnancy to Early Infancy: A Comprehensive Review.
LID - 133
AB  - Pregnancy induces a number of immunological, hormonal, and metabolic changes that
      are necessary for the mother to adapt her body to this new physiological
      situation. The microbiome of the mother, the placenta and the fetus influence the
      fetus growth and undoubtedly plays a major role in the adequate development of
      the newborn infant. Hence, the microbiome modulates the inflammatory mechanisms
      related to physiological and pathological processes that are involved in the
      perinatal progress through different mechanisms. The present review summarizes
      the actual knowledge related to physiological changes in the microbiota occurring
      in the mother, the fetus, and the child, both during neonatal period and beyond. 
      In addition, we approach some specific pathological situations during the
      perinatal periods, as well as the influence of the type of delivery and feeding.

TI  - Potentially inappropriate prescribing in dementia: a state-of-the-art review
      since 2007.
LID - e029172
AB  - Objectives: Dementia frequently occurs alongside comorbidities. Coexisting
      conditions are often managed with multiple medications, leading to increased risk
      of potentially inappropriate medication and adverse drug reactions. We aimed to
      estimate prevalence of, and identify factors reported to be associated with,
      potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) for older individuals diagnosed with 
      dementia. Design: We used a state-of-the-art review approach, selecting papers
      written in English and published from 2007 to January 2018. Publications were
      retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria included a
      formal diagnosis of dementia, a formal classification of PIP and reported
      prevalence of PIP as an outcome. Random effects models were used to provide a
      pooled estimate of prevalence of PIP. The Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional
      Studies (AXIS tool) was used to assess bias in the included studies. Results: The
      bibliographic search yielded 221 citations, with 12 studies meeting the inclusion
      criteria. The estimates of PIP prevalence for people living with dementia ranged 
      from 14% to 64%. Prevalence was 31% (95% CI 9 to 52) in the community, and 42%
      (95% CI 30 to 55) in nursing/care homes. PIP included prescribing likely related 
      to dementia (eg, hypnotics and sedative and cholinesterase inhibitors) and
      prescribing related to treatment of comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular drugs and
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication). Higher levels of comorbidity were
      associated with increased risk of PIP; however, only one study investigated
      associations with specific comorbidities of dementia. Conclusion: PIP remains a
      significant issue in healthcare management for people living with dementia.
      Higher levels of comorbidity are associated with increased prevalence of PIP, but
      the specific conditions driving this increase remain unknown. Further work is
      necessary to investigate PIP related to the presence of common comorbidities in
      patients living with dementia.

TI  - Comparison of ropivacaine combined with sufentanil for epidural anesthesia and
      spinal-epidural anesthesia in labor analgesia.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: To compare the application and efficacy of ropivacaine combined with 
      sufentanil for continuous epidural anesthesia (CEA) and combined spinal-epidural 
      anesthesia (CSEA) in labor analgesia. Methods: Three hundred sixty pregnant women
      requesting labor analgesia from October 2017 to August 2018 were selected
      retrospectively. According to the anesthetic method, subjects were divided into
      CSEA group and CEA group. Ropivacaine combined with sufentanil were used in all
      subjects. The labor time, visual analogue scale (VAS), Apgar score of newborn,
      adverse pregnancy outcomes and adverse drug reactions were observed. Results:
      There was no significant difference in pre-analgesia (T0) VAS scores between the 
      two groups (P > 0.05). VAS scores of first stage of labor (T1), second stage of
      labor (T2) and third stage of labor (T3) in CSEA group were significantly lower
      than CEA group (P < 0.01). The onset time, T1 and total labor time in CSEA group 
      were significantly shorter than CEA group (P < 0.01). There were no significant
      differences between T2 and T3 (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences
      in adverse pregnancy outcomes and Apgar scores at 1, 5 and 10 min after birth
      between the two groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of adverse drug outcomes in CSEA
      group was significantly lower than CEA group (P < 0.01). Maternal satisfaction in
      CSEA group was significantly higher than CEA group (P < 0.01). Conclusion:
      Considering ropivacaine combined with sufentanil for CSEA achieved a shorter
      onset time and labor period, significant analgesic effect, lower adverse drug
      reactions rates and higher subject satisfaction than CEA, it may be worthy of
      clinical promotion and application.

TI  - Clinical outcomes with endoscopic resection of lumbar extradural cysts.
PG  - S133-44
AB  - Background: Lumbar extradural cysts may be associated with sciatica-type back and
      leg pain. The symptoms of clinical pain syndrome from synovial cysts are
      sometimes difficult to differentiate from those of lumbar disc herniation or
      spinal canal stenosis and may be identified to be a pain source when visualized
      endoscopically. The authors analyzed the clinical outcomes with their endoscopic 
      resection to better establish clinical indications and prognosticators of
      favorable results. Methods: Two-year Macnab outcomes, VAS scores, and
      complications were analyzed in a series of 48 patients treated with the
      endoscopic removal of extradural cyst encountered during routine transforaminal
      and interlaminar decompression for foraminal and lateral recess stenosis causing 
      lumbar radiculopathy. Results: There were 26 female and 22 male patients. The
      extradural cysts were most commonly encountered at L4/5 level in 26 patients
      (72.2%) followed by the L5/S1 level in 8 patients (22.2%), and in 2 patients
      (5.6%) at the L3/4 level, respectively. One patient underwent T9/10
      decompression. At minimum 2-year follow-up, all patients were improved. Excellent
      results according to the Macnab criteria were obtained in 19/48 (39.6%) patients,
      good in 18/48 (37.5%), and fair in 11/48 (22.9%), respectively. The average
      preoperative VAS score for leg pain was 8.06±1.57 and reduced at a statistically 
      significant level (P<0.000) postoperatively to 1.92±1.49, and 1.77±1.32 at final 
      follow-up, respectively. The percentage of patients with unlimited walking
      endurance had improved at a statistically significant level (P<0.0001) from 33.3%
      preoperatively (16/48) to 81.3% (39/48) postoperatively. One patient had a
      recurrent disc herniation, and another patient did not improve. Two patients
      underwent fusion during the follow-up period. Patients with Fair outcomes had a
      statistically significant association (P<0.001) with facet instability as
      suggested by axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of
      thickened ligamentum flavum, facet joint hypertrophy, and bright white
      fluid-filled joint gap of >2 mm. Conclusions: Endoscopic resection of extradural 
      spinal cysts during routine decompression for symptomatic foraminal and lateral
      recess stenosis is feasible with favorable clinical outcomes in the majority of
      patients. Fair outcomes were associated with advanced instability of the involved
      lumbar facet joint complex.

TI  - Comparison of Continuous Epidural Infusion of Bupivacaine and Fentanyl Versus
      Patient Controlled Analgesia Techniques for Labor Analgesia: A Randomized
      Controlled Trial (RCT).
PG  - 42-8
AB  - Background:: To diminish labor pain, several techniques have been used in
      developed countries. In the current randomized controlled trial, the use of
      epidural analgesia via PCEA pump with and without background infusion of
      analgesic was studied. Methods:: In this double-blinded controlled trial, 60
      women were enrolled and randomly assigned to study groups for receiving epidural 
      analgesia during labor. All patients received initial bullous dose including 125 
      mg bupivacaine and 3 mg/ml fentanyl, and the first group patient (CI) received
      background infusion of 8 ml/hr and the second group (PCEA) received 10 ml bullous
      dose of 125 mg bupivacaine combined with 100 mcg fentanyl (2 ml) via epidural
      catheter. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of 0–10 was measured 20 min after drug 
      injection. The chi-square and student T-test were used for comparing variables
      between groups, and 0.05 was considered as the level of significance. Results::
      There was no significant difference in terms of demographic variables. Mean
      duration of the second stage of labor was significantly lower in patients
      received continuous infusion (CI) (p<0.0001). However, the total administered
      fentanyl dose was significantly higher in patients who underwent PCEA (p<0.0001).
      Besides, the CI group had a significantly lower rate of patient-controlled
      injection compared to PCEA patients (p<0.0001). However, there was no significant
      difference between patients’ satisfaction and VAS in study groups. Conclusion::
      Epidural analgesia using PCEA combined with continuous infusion did not provide
      higher analgesia or patients’ satisfaction compared to PCEA alone; however, it
      led to a decreased rate of drug injection and total administered dosage.

      regimen, and outcomes reported to prevent or treat delirium in hospitalized
      children. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts
      were searched using the keywords “haloperidol,” “olanzapine,” “quetiapine,”
      “risperidone,” “ziprasidone,” and “delirium.” Articles evaluating the use of
      these agents to manage delirium in hospitalized children that were published
      between 1946 and August 2019 were included. Two authors independently screened
      each article for inclusion. Reports were excluded if they were published
      abstracts or included fewer than 3 patients in the report. RESULTS: Thirteen
      reports that included 370 children receiving haloperidol, quetiapine, olanzapine,
      and/or risperidone for delirium treatment were reviewed. Most children received
      haloperidol (n = 131) or olanzapine (n = 125). Significant variability in dosing 
      was noted. A total of 23 patients (6.2%) had an adverse drug event, including 13 
      (56.5%) who experienced dystonia and 3 (13.0%) with a prolonged corrected QT
      interval. Most reports described improvement in delirium symptoms; however, only 
      5 reports used a validated screening tool for PICU delirium to evaluate
      antipsychotic response. CONCLUSIONS: Most reports noted efficacy with
      antipsychotics, but these reports were limited by sample size and lacked a
      validated PICU delirium tool. Future research is needed to determine the optimal 
      agent and dosage regimen to treat PICU delirium.

PG  - 54-60
AB  - Elderly patients suffering from chronic cardio-pulmonary diseases commonly
      experience acute respiratory failure. As in younger patients, a well-known
      therapeutic approach of noninvasive mechanical ventilation is able to prevent
      orotracheal intubation in a large number of severe scenarios in elderly patients.
      In addition, this type of ventilation is frequently applied in elderly patients
      who refuse intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. The rate of failure of
      noninvasive ventilation may be reduced by means of the integration of new
      technological devices (i.e., high-flow nasal cannula, extracorporeal CO2 removal,
      cough assistance and high-frequency chest wall oscillation, and fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy). Ethical issues with end-of-life decisions and the choice of the
      environment are not clearly defined in the treatment of elderly with acute
      respiratory insufficiency.

TI  - Postoperative pain management for circumcision; Comparison of frequently used
      methods.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - Objective:: To determine the ideal method for postoperative pain management after
      circumcision by comparing the most frequently used different methods like; dorsal
      penile block, caudal epidural block, subcutaneous ring block, intravenous
      paracetamol and intravenous tramadol HCl. Methods:: Between May 1st 2015 to May
      1st 2016, 500 children between 2-10 year old were circumcised at the department
      of pediatric surgery of Istanbul Medipol University Health Care Practice &
      Research Center Sefakoy Hospital. Five groups were formed according to
      postoperative analgesia methods which were planned to be compared; Group-I.
      penile block, Group-II. Caudal epidural block, Group-III. subcutaneous ring
      block, Group-IV as intravenous paracetamol and Group-V as intravenous tramadol
      HCl. In order to evaluate the postoperative pain levels of children, Children’s
      Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) was filled at 30, 60, 120, 180
      minutes after circumcision by a researcher who does not know which method was
      applied. Results:: No significant difference is found between the groups
      (p>0.05). In the statistical analysis, no significant difference was found in the
      effect of analgesia methods on CHEOPS scores between 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes 
      (p>0.05). In parallel with this result, no significant difference was found in
      the effect of heart beat rates and respiration rate averages between 30, 60, 120 
      and 180 minutes (p>0.05). Conclusion:: It has been shown that none of the five
      method has any superiority in reducing pain after circumcision and that all five 
      methods can be used. However, we think that side effects of regional anesthesia
      and systemic analgesic applications should not be ignored.

TI  - Sex Differences Revealed in a Mouse CFA Inflammation Model with Macrophage
      Targeted Nanotheranostics.
PG  - 1694-707
AB  - Monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) infiltrate sites of infection or injury and
      upregulate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme that stimulates prostaglandin-E2
      (PgE2). Nanotheranostics combine therapeutic and diagnostic agents into a single 
      nanosystem. In previous studies, we demonstrated that a nanotheranostic strategy,
      based on theranostic nanoemulsions (NE) loaded with a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib,
      CXB) and equipped with near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) reporters, can
      specifically target circulating monocytes and MDMs. The anti-inflammatory and
      anti-nociceptive effects of such cell-specific COX-2 inhibition lasted several
      days following Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) or nerve injury in male mice. The
      overall goal of this study was to investigate the extended (up to 40 days) impact
      of MDM-targeted COX-2 inhibition and any sex-based differences in treatment
      response; both of which remain unknown. Our study also evaluates the feasibility 
      and efficacy of a preclinical nanotheranostic strategy for mechanistic
      investigation of the impact of such sex differences on clinical outcomes.Methods:
      CFA was administered into the right hind paws of male and female mice. All mice
      received a single intravenous dose of NIRF labeled CXB loaded NE twelve hours
      prior to CFA injection. In vivo whole body NIRF imaging and mechanical
      hypersensitivity assays were performed sequentially and ex vivo NIRF imaging and 
      immunohistopathology of foot pad tissues were performed at the end point of 40
      days.Results: Targeted COX-2 inhibition of MDMs in male and female mice
      successfully improved mechanical hypersensitivity after CFA injury. However, we
      observed distinct sex-specific differences in the intensity or longevity of the
      nociceptive responses. In males, a single dose of CXB-NE administered via tail
      vein injection produced significant improved mechanical hypersensitivity for 32
      days as compared to the drug free NE (DF-NE) (untreated) control group. In
      females, CXB-NE produced similar, though less prominent and shorter-lived
      effects, lasting up to 11 days. NIRF imaging confirmed that CXB-NE can be
      detected up to day 40 in the CFA injected foot pad tissues of both sexes. There
      were distinct signal distribution trends between males and females, suggesting
      differences in macrophage infiltration dynamics between the sexes. This may also 
      relate to differences in macrophage turnover rate between the sexes, a
      possibility that requires further investigation in this model.Conclusions: For
      the first time, this study provides unique insight into MDM dynamics and the
      early as well as longer-term targeted effects and efficacy of a clinically
      translatable nanotheranostic agent on MDM mediated inflammation. Our data
      supports the potential of nanotheranostics as presented in elucidating the
      kinetics, dynamics and sex-based differences in the adaptive or innate immune
      responses to inflammatory triggers. Taken together, our study findings lead us
      closer to true personalized, sex-specific pain nanomedicine for a wide range of
      inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Incarceration and Number of Sexual Partners After Incarceration Among Vulnerable 
      US Women, 2007–2017.
PG  - S100-8
AB  - Objectives. To examine whether women’s incarceration increases numbers of total
      and new sexual partners.Methods. US women with or at risk for HIV in a
      multicenter cohort study answered incarceration and sexual partner questions
      semiannually between 2007 and 2017. We used marginal structural models to compare
      total and new partners at visits not following incarceration with all visits
      following incarceration and visits immediately following incarceration.
      Covariates included demographics, HIV status, sex exchange, drug or alcohol use, 
      and housing instability.Results. Of the 3180 participants, 155 were incarcerated.
      Women reported 2 partners, 3 or more partners, and new partners at 5.2%, 5.2%,
      and 9.3% of visits, respectively. Relative to visits not occurring after
      incarceration, odds ratios were 2.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20, 4.85) 
      for 2 partners, 2.03 (95% CI = 0.97, 4.26) for 3 or more partners, and 3.24 (95% 
      CI = 1.69, 6.22) for new partners at visits immediately after incarceration. Odds
      ratios were similar for all visits following incarceration.Conclusions. Women had
      more total partners and new partners immediately and at all visits following
      incarceration after confounders and loss to follow-up had been taken into
      account.

TI  - Effect of preemptive analgesia with ibuprofen in the control of postoperative
      pain in dental implant surgeries: A randomized, triple-blind controlled clinical 
      trial.
PG  - e71-8
AB  - Background: Preemptive analgesia has as its basic principle the administration of
      analgesics before the onset of painful stimuli, in order to reduce or prevent
      postoperative pain, but this question is little explored in implantology. Thus,
      this study was conducted in order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ibuprofen 
      in pain prevention after unit implant surgery. Material and Methods: For this
      triple-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trial, 54
      insertion surgeries of unitary implants were performed. Two groups have received 
      two different protocols 1 hour before surgery: Ibuprofen group (IBU) 600 mg of
      ibuprofen; and (2) placebo group (maize starch). The intensity of the pain was
      evaluated through the visual analogue scale (VAS) in 6 times (1, 6, 12, 24, 48
      and 72 hours after the surgery). Patients were instructed to take 750 mg of
      paracetamol as rescue medication, if necessary. The occurrence and the intensity 
      of pain were analyzed by means of an analysis of variance ANOVA with repeated
      measurements using the general linear model procedure. Results: The IBU group had
      significantly lower VAS scores overall (IBU = 0.30, ± 0.57; placebo = 1.14, ±
      1.07; p<0.001) and at all times in the intra, intergroup comparisons and
      time/group interaction than the placebo group (p<0.001). The use of rescue
      medication was significantly lower and the postoperative time was longer in the
      IBU group compared to placebo (p = 0.002). Conclusions: The single use of
      ibuprofen was found to be significantly superior in reducing pain after unit
      implant surgery compared to placebo. Key words:Analgesia, dental implants, pain, 
      surgery, oral.

TI  - The Evolving Pharmacotherapeutic Landscape for the Treatment of Sickle Cell
      Disease.
LID - e2020010
AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an extremely heterogeneous disease that has been
      associated with global morbidity and early mortality. More effective and
      inexpensive therapies are needed. During the last five years, the landscape of
      the pharmacotherapy of SCD has changed dramatically. Currently, 54 drugs have
      been used or under consideration to use for the treatment of SCD. These fall into
      3 categories: the first category includes the four drugs (Hydroxyurea,
      L-Glutamine, Crizanlizumab tmca and Voxelotor) that have been approved by the
      United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on successful clinical
      trials. The second category includes 22 drugs that failed, discontinued or
      terminated for now and the third category includes 28 drugs that are actively
      being considered for the treatment of SCD. Crizanlizumab and Voxelotor are
      included in the first and third categories because they have been used in more
      than one trial. New therapies targeting multiple pathways in the complex
      pathophysiology of SCD have been achieved or are under continued investigation.
      The emerging trend seems to be the use of multimodal drugs (i.e. drugs that have 
      different mechanisms of action) to treat SCD similar to the use of multiple
      chemotherapeutic agents to treat cancer.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine during suprazygomatic maxillary nerve block for pediatric cleft
      palate repair, randomized double-blind controlled study.
PG  - 81-9
AB  - Background: For children with cleft palates, surgeries at a young age are
      necessary to reduce feeding or phonation difficulties and reduce complications,
      especially respiratory tract infections and frequent sinusitis. We hypothesized
      that dexmedetomidine might prolong the postoperative analgesic duration when
      added to bupivacaine during nerve blocks. Methods: Eighty patients of 1–5 years
      old were arbitrarily assigned to two equal groups (forty patients each) to
      receive bilateral suprazygomatic maxillary nerve blocks. Group A received
      bilateral 0.2 mL/kg bupivacaine (0.125%; maximum volume 4 mL/side). Group B
      received bilateral 0.2 mL/kg bupivacaine (0.125%) + 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine
      (maximum volume 4 mL/side). Results: The modified children’s hospital of Eastern 
      Ontario pain scale score was significantly lower in group B children after 8
      hours of follow-up postoperatively (P < 0.001). Mean values of heart rate and
      blood pressure were significantly different between the groups, with lower mean
      values in group B (P < 0.001). Median time to the first analgesic demand in group
      A children was 10 hours (range 8–12 hr), and no patients needed analgesia in
      group B. The sedation score assessment was higher in children given
      dexmedetomidine (P = 0.03) during the first postoperative 30 minutes. Better
      parent satisfaction scores (5-point Likert scale) were recorded in group B and
      without serious adverse effects. Conclusions: Addition of dexmedetomidine 0.5
      μg/kg to bupivacaine 0.125% has accentuated the analgesic efficacy of bilateral
      suprazygomatic maxillary nerve block in children undergoing primary cleft palate 
      repair with less postoperative supplemental analgesia or untoward effects.

TI  - Medication Use in Schools: Current Trends, Challenges, and Best Practices.
PG  - 7-24
AB  - There are a significant number of students on maintenance medications for chronic
      diseases or with diagnoses that may result in medical emergencies requiring
      administration of medications in school. With passing of legislation in all 50
      states allowing self-administration of emergency medications for allergic
      reactions and asthma, the landscape of medication use in schools is changing.
      These changes have raised questions about the need for legislation or policy
      development relating to self-carrying and self-administration of medications for 
      other disease states, undesignated stock of emergency medications, and
      administration of medications by non-medical personnel. Medication administration
      in the school setting has become a complex issue, and this review will discuss
      current legislation related to medication use in schools and provide best
      practices for administering medications to children and adolescents while at
      school.

TI  - Current Status of Therapeutic Approaches against Peripheral Nerve Injuries: A
      Detailed Story from Injury to Recovery.
PG  - 116-34
AB  - Peripheral nerve injury is a complex condition with a variety of signs and
      symptoms such as numbness, tingling, jabbing, throbbing, burning or sharp pain.
      Peripheral nerves are fragile in nature and can easily get damaged due to acute
      compression or trauma which may lead to the sensory and motor functions deficits 
      and even lifelong disability. After lesion, the neuronal cell body becomes
      disconnected from the axon's distal portion to the injury site leading to the
      axonal degeneration and dismantlement of neuromuscular junctions of targeted
      muscles. In spite of extensive research on this aspect, complete functional
      recovery still remains a challenge to be resolved. This review highlights
      detailed pathophysiological events after an injury to a peripheral nerve and the 
      associated factors that can either hinder or promote the regenerative machinery. 
      In addition, it throws light on the available therapeutic strategies including
      supporting therapies, surgical and non-surgical interventions to ameliorate the
      axonal regeneration, neuronal survival, and reinnervation of peripheral targets. 
      Despite the availability of various treatment options, we are still lacking the
      optimal treatments for a perfect and complete functional regain. The need for the
      present age is to discover or design such potent compounds that would be able to 
      execute the complete functional retrieval. In this regard, plant-derived
      compounds are getting more attention and several recent reports validate their
      remedial effects. A plethora of plants and plant-derived phytochemicals have been
      suggested with curative effects against a number of diseases in general and
      neuronal injury in particular. They can be a ray of hope for the suffering
      individuals.

TI  - Opioid Use Fueling HIV Transmission in an Urban Setting: An Outbreak of HIV
      Infection Among People Who Inject Drugs—Massachusetts, 2015–2018.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - Objectives. To describe and control an outbreak of HIV infection among people who
      inject drugs (PWID).Methods. The investigation included people diagnosed with HIV
      infection during 2015 to 2018 linked to 2 cities in northeastern Massachusetts
      epidemiologically or through molecular analysis. Field activities included
      qualitative interviews regarding service availability and HIV risk
      behaviors.Results. We identified 129 people meeting the case definition; 116
      (90%) reported injection drug use. Molecular surveillance added 36 cases to the
      outbreak not otherwise linked. The 2 largest molecular groups contained 56 and 23
      cases. Most interviewed PWID were homeless. Control measures, including enhanced 
      field epidemiology, syringe services programming, and community outreach,
      resulted in a significant decline in new HIV diagnoses.Conclusions. We illustrate
      difficulties with identification and characterization of an outbreak of HIV
      infection among a population of PWID and the value of an intensive
      response.Public Health Implications. Responding to and preventing outbreaks
      requires ongoing surveillance, with timely detection of increases in HIV
      diagnoses, community partnerships, and coordinated services, all critical to
      achieving the goal of the national Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative.
