TI  - Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder in Pregnant Women via Telemedicine: A
      Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.
LID - e1920177
AB  - Question: Is opioid use disorder treatment received via telemedicine in obstetric
      practices associated with similar maternal and newborn outcomes compared with
      opioid use disorder treatment received in person in obstetric practices?
      Findings: In this nonrandomized controlled trial including 98 pregnant women with
      opioid use disorder, there were no statistically significant differences in rates
      of retention in treatment between women receiving opioid use disorder treatment
      via telemedicine vs in person (80.4% vs 92.7%). These findings were also apparent
      in newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome (telemedicine: 45.4% vs in person: 
      63.2%). Meaning: Telemedicine may provide a scalable solution to making
      lifesaving treatment available to pregnant women to reduce the maternal morbidity
      and mortality associated with opioid use disorder and improve maternal and child 
      health.

TI  - Morphine plasmatic concentration in a pregnant mare and its foal after long term 
      epidural administration.
LID - 19
AB  - Background: Epidural administration of morphine has been shown to be an effective
      analgesic strategy in horses; however, the possible occurrence of side effects
      limits its usage. In order to decrease their frequency, it is important to target
      the minimal effective plasma concentration and avoid overdosing. As to date
      species-specific pharmacokinetics data are not available for epidural morphine,
      the dosing regimen is usually established on the basis of clinical reports and
      personal experience. In certain physiological conditions, like gestation, the
      outcome of an empirical dosing scheme can be unpredictable. The aim of this case 
      report is to describe the pharmacological profile of morphine and its metabolites
      after prolonged epidural administration in a pregnant mare and her foal. Case
      presentation: A 20 years old pregnant mare was presented to our hospital because 
      of severe lameness, 2 months before delivery. Following an ineffective systemic
      pain treatment, an epidural catheter was inserted and morphine administered
      (initial dose 0.1 mg/kg every 8 h). Due to its efficacy in controlling pain, it
      was continued until end of gestation. Plasmatic concentration of morphine and its
      metabolites were assessed in the mare 6 weeks after starting the treatment, and
      in both the mare and foal during the first days after delivery. Plasmatic values 
      similar to those previously reported in the literature following morphine short
      term administration through various routes and not accompanied by side effects
      were found in the mare, except during an excitatory period. Moreover, no evidence
      of dangerous drug accumulation or significant milk passage was noticed in the
      foal. Mild reduction of feces production with no signs of colic and two
      self-limiting episodes of excitement occurred during treatment in the mare. No
      side effects occurred during gestation and first phases of life in the foal.
      Conclusion: Prolonged epidural administration of morphine in a pregnant mare
      allowed good pain control in absence of clinically relevant side effects, in both
      the mare and her foal. Sudden increase in morphine plasmatic concentration can
      occur and side effects appear; careful treatment to the lowest effective dose and
      continuous monitoring of the clinical condition of the treated horse should be
      performed.
