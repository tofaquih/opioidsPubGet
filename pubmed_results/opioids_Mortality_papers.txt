TI  - Incidence of Opioid Overdose Among Patients Using ER/LA Opioid Analgesics Before 
      and After Implementation of the Class-Wide Opioid Risk Evaluation and Mitigation 
      Strategy.
PG  - 157-69
AB  - Introduction: The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required 
      a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and
      long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics on 09 July 2012. Methods: This study
      compared the incidence of opioid overdose before (July 2010-June 2012) and after 
      (July 2013-September 2016) the initiation of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
      Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics.
      We identified patients with ≥1 ER/LA opioid dispensing in either time period in
      national data from the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and in
      United States (US) Medicaid claims data from four states. We described each
      population, calculated the incidence rate (IR) of opioid overdose, and assessed
      crude and propensity score adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing the
      overdose rate after vs before implementation of the REMS. Results: A total of
      121,229 commercially insured and 11,488 Medicaid patients were included in the
      analysis. Rates of overdose were substantially higher in Medicaid patients than
      in the commercially insured patients (IR 192.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      162.60–225.18 versus 102.60, 95% CI 93.0–112.93 in the active period). The IRRs
      for opioid overdose were 1.01 (95% CI 0.87–1.17) in the commercially insured
      population and 0.70 (95% CI 0.52–0.93) in Medicaid. Conclusion: This leveling off
      of overdose rates among commercially insured patients and decline among Medicaid 
      patients is encouraging, but it is difficult to disentangle the specific impact
      of the REMS from many other ongoing initiatives with similar goals.

TI  - The Surgeon's Role in the Opioid Crisis: A Narrative Review and Call to Action.
LID - 4
AB  - Over the past two decades, there has been a sharp rise in the use of prescription
      opioids. In several countries, most notably the United States, opioid-related
      harm has been deemed a public health crisis. As surgeons are among the most
      prolific prescribers of opioids, growing attention is now being paid to the role 
      that opioids play in surgical care. While opioids may sometimes be necessary to
      provide patients with adequate relief from acute pain after major surgery, the
      impact of opioids on the quality and safety of surgical care calls for greater
      scrutiny. This narrative review summarizes the available evidence on rates of
      persistent postsurgical opioid use and highlights the need to target known risk
      factors for persistent postoperative use before patients present for surgery. We 
      draw attention to the mounting evidence that preoperative opioid exposure places 
      patients at risk of persistent postoperative use, while also contributing to an
      increased risk of several other adverse clinical outcomes. By discussing the
      prevalence of excess opioid prescribing following surgery and highlighting
      significant variations in prescribing practices between countries, we note that
      there is a pressing need to optimize postoperative prescribing practices. Guided 
      by the available evidence, we call for specific actions to be taken to address
      important research gaps and alleviate the harms associated with opioid use among 
      surgical patients.

TI  - Association between opioid analgesic therapy and initiation of buprenorphine
      management: An analysis of prescription drug monitoring program data.
LID - e0227350
AB  - Background: In the US, medication assisted treatment, particularly with
      office-based buprenorphine, has been an important component of opioid dependence 
      treatment among patients with iatrogenic addiction to opioid analgesics. The
      predictors of initiating buprenorphine for addiction among opioid analgesic
      patients have not been well-described. Methods: We conducted a time-to-event
      analysis using data from the North Carolina (NC) Prescription Drug Monitoring
      Program (PDMP). Our outcome of interest was time-to-initiation of sublingual
      buprenorphine. Our study population was a prospective cohort of all state
      residents receiving a full-agonist opioid analgesic between 2011 and 2015.
      Predictors of initiation of sublingual buprenorphine examined included: age,
      gender, cumulative pharmacies and prescribers utilized, cumulative opioid
      intensity (defined as cumulative opioid exposure divided by duration of opioid
      exposure), and benzodiazepine dispensing. Findings: Of 4.3 million patients
      receiving opioid analgesics in NC between 2011 and 2015 (accumulated 8.30 million
      person-years of follow-up), and a total of 28,904 patients initiated
      buprenorphine formulations intended for addiction treatment (overall rate 3.48
      per 1,000 person-years). In adjusted multivariate models, the utilization of 3 or
      more pharmacies (HR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.82, 3.05) or 6 or more controlled substance 
      prescribers (HR: 12.09; 95% CI: 10.76, 13.57) was associated with buprenorphine
      initiation. A dose-response relationship was observed for cumulative opioid
      intensity (HR in highest decile relative to lowest decile: 5.05; 95% CI: 4.70,
      5.42). Benzodiazepine dispensing was negatively associated with buprenorphine
      initiation (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.65). Conclusions: Opioid analgesic patients
      utilizing multiple prescribers or pharmacies are more likely to initiate
      sublingual buprenorphine. This finding suggests that patients with multiple
      healthcare interactions are more likely to be treated for high-risk opioid use,
      or may be more likely to be identified and treated for addiction. Future research
      should utilize prescription monitoring program data linked to electronic health
      records to include diagnosis information in analytic models.

TI  - In inpatients with cirrhosis opioid use is common and associated with length of
      stay and persistent use post-discharge.
LID - e0229497
AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that opioids are often prescribed 
      and associated with complications in outpatients with cirrhosis. Less is known
      about opioids among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. We aimed to describe
      the patterns and complications of opioid use among inpatients with cirrhosis.
      Methods: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with cirrhosis
      admitted to a single hospital system from 4/4/2014 to 9/30/2015. We excluded
      hospitalizations with a surgery, invasive procedure, or palliative care/hospice
      consult in order to understand opioid use that may be avoidable. We determined
      the frequency, dosage, and type of opioids given during hospitalization. Using
      bivariable and multivariable analyses, we assessed length of stay, intensive care
      unit transfer, and in-hospital mortality by opioid use. Results: Of 217
      inpatients with cirrhosis, 118 (54.4%) received opioids during hospitalization,
      including 41.7% of patients without prior outpatient opioid prescriptions.
      Benzodiazepines or hypnotic sleep aids were given to 28.8% of opioid recipients. 
      In the multivariable model, younger age and outpatient opioid prescription were
      associated with inpatient opioids. Hospitalization was longer among opioid
      recipients (median 3.9 vs 3.0 days, p = 0.002) and this difference remained after
      adjusting for age, cirrhosis severity, and medical comorbidities. There was no
      difference in intensive care unit transfers and no deaths occurred. At discharge,
      22 patients were newly started on opioids of whom 10 (45.5%) had opioid
      prescriptions at 90 days post-discharge. Conclusion: In non-surgical inpatients
      with cirrhosis, opioid prescribing was common and associated with prolonged
      length of stay. A high proportion of patients newly discharged with opioid
      prescriptions had ongoing prescriptions at 90 days post-discharge.

TI  - Experiences of people taking opioid medication for chronic non-malignant pain: a 
      qualitative evidence synthesis using meta-ethnography.
LID - e032988
AB  - Objective: To review qualitative studies on the experience of taking opioid
      medication for chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) or coming off them. Design: This
      is a qualitative evidence synthesis using a seven-step approach from the methods 
      of meta-ethnography. Data sources and eligibility criteria: We searched selected 
      databases—Medline, Embase, AMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
      Literature, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus (Science Citation Index and
      Social Science Citation Index)—for qualitative studies which provide patients’
      views of taking opioid medication for CNMP or of coming off them (June 2017,
      updated September 2018). Data extraction and synthesis: Papers were quality
      appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool, and the
      GRADE-CERQual (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
      working group - Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research)
      guidelines were applied. We identified concepts and iteratively abstracted these 
      concepts into a line of argument. Results: We screened 2994 unique citations and 
      checked 153 full texts, and 31 met our review criteria. We identified five
      themes: (1) reluctant users with little choice; (2) understanding opioids: the
      good and the bad; (3) a therapeutic alliance: not always on the same page; (4)
      stigma: feeling scared and secretive but needing support; and (5) the challenge
      of tapering or withdrawal. A new overarching theme of ‘constantly balancing’
      emerged from the data. Conclusions: People taking opioids were constantly
      balancing tensions, not always wanting to take opioids, and weighing the pros and
      cons of opioids but feeling they had no choice because of the pain. They
      frequently felt stigmatised, were not always ‘on the same page’ as their
      healthcare professional and felt changes in opioid use were often challenging.

TI  - Peripheral Opioid Receptor Antagonists for Opioid-Induced Constipation: A Primer 
      on Pharmacokinetic Variabilities with a Focus on Drug Interactions.
PG  - 447-56
AB  - Opioid analgesics remain a treatment option for refractory acute and chronic
      pain, despite their potential risk for abuse and adverse events (AEs). Opioids
      are associated with several common AEs, but the most bothersome is opioid-induced
      constipation (OIC). OIC is often overlooked but has the potential to affect
      patient quality of life, increase associated symptom burden, and impede long-term
      opioid compliance. The peripherally acting µ-receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) are a
      class of drugs that include methylnaltrexone, naloxegol, and naldemedine.
      Collectively, each is approved for the treatment of OIC. PAMORAs work
      peripherally in the gastrointestinal tract, without impacting the central
      analgesic effects of opioids. However, each has unique pharmacokinetic properties
      that may be impacted by coadministered drugs or food. This review focuses on
      important metabolic and pharmacokinetic principals that are pertinent to drug
      interactions involving µ-opioid receptor antagonists prescribed for OIC. It
      highlights subtle differences among the PAMORAs that may have clinical
      significance. For example, unlike naloxegol or naldemedine, methylnaltrexone is
      not a substrate for CYP3A4 or p-glycoprotein; therefore, its plasma concentration
      is not altered when coadministered with concomitant medications that are CYP3A4
      or p-glycoprotein inducers or inhibitors. With a better understanding of
      pharmacokinetic nuances of each PAMORA, clinicians will be better equipped to
      identify potential safety and efficacy considerations that may arise when PAMORAs
      are coadministered with other medications.

TI  - Opioid Prescribing Behaviors — Prescription Behavior Surveillance System, 11
      States, 2010–2016.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Problem/Condition: In 2017, a total of 70,237 persons in the United States died
      from a drug overdose, and 67.8% of these deaths involved an opioid. Historically,
      the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States has been closely associated
      with a parallel increase in opioid prescribing and with widespread misuse of
      these medications. National and state policy makers have introduced multiple
      measures to attempt to assess and control the opioid overdose epidemic since
      2010, including improvements in surveillance systems. Period Covered: 2010–2016
      Description of System: The Prescription Behavior Surveillance System (PBSS) was
      created in 2011. Its goal was to track rates of prescribing of controlled
      substances and possible misuse of such drugs using data from selected state
      prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP). PBSS data measure prescribing
      behaviors for prescription opioids using multiple measures calculated from PDMP
      data including 1) opioid prescribing, 2) average daily opioid dosage, 3)
      proportion of patients with daily opioid dosages ≥90 morphine milligram
      equivalents, 4) overlapping opioid prescriptions, 5) overlapping opioid and
      benzodiazepine prescriptions, and 6) multiple-provider episodes. For this
      analysis, PBSS data were available for 2010–2016 from 11 states representing
      approximately 38.0% of the U.S. population. Average quarterly percent changes
      (AQPC) in the rates of opioid prescribing and possible opioid misuse measures
      were calculated for each state. Results and Interpretation: Opioid prescribing
      rates declined in all 11 states during 2010–2016 (range: 14.9% to 33.0%). Daily
      dosage declined least (AQPC: -0.4%) in Idaho and Maine, and most (AQPC: -1.6%) in
      Florida. The percentage of patients with high daily dosage had AQPCs ranging from
      -0.4% in Idaho to -2.3% in Louisiana. Multiple-provider episode rates declined by
      at least 62% in the seven states with available data. Variations in trends across
      the 11 states might reflect differences in state policies and possible
      differential effects of similar policies. Public Health Actions: Use of PDMP data
      from individual states enables a more detailed examination of trends in opioid
      prescribing behaviors and indicators of possible misuse than is feasible with
      national commercially available prescription data. Comparison of opioid
      prescribing trends among states can be used to monitor the temporal association
      of national or state policy interventions and might help public health
      policymakers recognize changes in the use or possible misuse of controlled
      prescription drugs over time and allow for prompt intervention through amended or
      new opioid-related policies.

TI  - The opioid mortality epidemic in North America: do we understand the supply side 
      dynamics of this unprecedented crisis?
LID - 14
AB  - While there has been extensive attention to the ‘demand side’ – or use and
      adverse consequences, including mortality – of the ‘opioid crisis’ presently
      unfolding across North America, few considerations have focused on the supply
      side. This paper examines the supply side dynamics of this unprecedented public
      health phenomenon. We provide evidence for several interrelated supply-side
      elements that have contributed to the present public health crisis. We observe
      that initially, persistently high levels of prescription opioid availability and 
      use exposed large proportions of the North American population to opioids,
      resulting in correspondingly high levels of medical and non-medical use (e.g.,
      involving diversion). While various intervention measures to control prescription
      opioid availability and use have been implemented in recent years, leading to
      eventual reductions in opioid dispensing levels, these occurred late in the
      crisis’s evolution. Moreover, these supply reductions have not been met by
      corresponding reductions in opioid use or demand levels. These growing
      discrepancies between opioid demand and prescription-based sources have left
      major gaps in opioid supplies. In response to such supply gaps, highly potent and
      toxic illicit opioid products have rapidly proliferated across North America, and
      become a core driver of the dramatic spikes in opioid overdose fatality levels in
      recent years. These supply-related interrelations are corroborated by a
      corresponding increase in illicit opioid-related fatalities, which arose just as 
      medical opioid supplies began to decrease in many jurisdictions. Improved
      analyses and understanding of the supply-side dynamics of the opioid crisis are
      urgently needed in order to inform future intervention and policy development.
      Meanwhile, the high mortality toll related to illicit, highly toxic opioid
      exposure requires sustained solutions, including supply-oriented measures (e.g., 
      safer opioid distribution for at–risk users) towards improved public health
      protection.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Opioid Cessation.
LID - 180
AB  - The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) and
      overdose-related deaths. However, the genetic basis for the ability to
      discontinue opioid use has not been investigated. We performed a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) of opioid cessation (defined as abstinence from illicit 
      opioids for >1 year or <6 months before the interview date) in 1130 African
      American (AA) and 2919 European ancestry (EA) participants recruited for genetic 
      studies of substance use disorders and who met lifetime Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for OUD.
      Association tests performed separately within each ethnic group were combined by 
      meta-analysis with results obtained from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study.
      Although there were no genome-wide significant associations, we found suggestive 
      associations with nine independent loci, including three which are biologically
      relevant: rs4740988 in PTPRD (pAA + EA = 2.24 × 10−6), rs36098404 in MYOM2 (pEA =
      2.24 × 10−6), and rs592026 in SNAP25-AS1 (pEA = 6.53 × 10−6). Significant
      pathways identified in persons of European ancestry (EA) are related to vitamin D
      metabolism (p = 3.79 × 10−2) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (p =
      2.39 × 10−2). UK Biobank traits including smoking and drinking cessation and
      chronic back pain were significantly associated with opioid cessation using
      GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores. These results provide evidence for genetic
      influences on opioid cessation, suggest genetic overlap with other relevant
      traits, and may indicate potential novel therapeutic targets for OUD.

LID - e200802
AB  - Question: Have emergency department clinicians responded to the opioid epidemic
      through altering opioid prescription rates? Findings: In this cross-sectional
      study of 556 176 emergency department patient encounters and 70 218 opioid
      prescriptions within a single emergency department, yearly prescriptions
      decreased by 66.3% between 2013 and 2018. This decrease was associated with a
      71.1% reduction in the number of opioid prescriptions for musculoskeletal pain
      (back, limb, joint, and neck pain) and lesser, but still marked, decreases for
      fractures and kidney stones. Meaning: Reductions in yearly opioid prescriptions
      across varying indications appear to be aligned with recognition of the opioid
      crisis in addition to national, state, and departmental education guidelines.

TI  - PRESCRIPTION OPIOID MISUSE MOTIVE LATENT CLASSES: OUTCOMES FROM A NATIONALLY
      REPRESENTATIVE US SAMPLE.
PG  - e97
AB  - Aims:: Prescription opioid misuse (POM) contributes to a larger opioid crisis in 
      the US and Canada, with over 17,000 US POM-related overdose deaths in 2017. Our
      aims were to 1) identify specific profiles of respondents based on POM motives
      using the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and 2) compare
      profile respondents on sociodemographics, substance use and mental and physical
      health outcomes. Methods:: Analyses included 2017-18 NSDUH respondents with data 
      on POM motives (n= 4,810). POM was defined as prescription opioid use in a way
      not intended by the prescriber, including use without a prescription, in larger
      amounts or more frequently. Nine POM motives for the most recent episode were
      assessed, including “to relieve physical pain” and “to get high”. Latent classes,
      based on POM motives, were estimated. Classes were compared on sociodemographics,
      substance use, physical and mental health outcomes. Results:: Eight latent
      classes were identified (in order of prevalence): pain relief only, relax-pain
      relief, sleep-pain relief, multi-motive, high, experimenter, emotional coping,
      and dependent/hooked. Compared to the pain relief only group, the high and
      multi-motive classes had higher odds of all substance use outcomes, with the
      dependent/hooked class having higher odds on all but one outcome. Six of the
      eight classes had higher odds of past-year mental health treatment and suicidal
      ideation than the pain relief only class. Conclusions:: Screening for pain, pain 
      conditions, problematic substance use and psychopathology are recommended in
      those with any POM. While those in the dependent/hooked, multi-motive, and
      emotional coping classes are most likely to have prescription opioid use
      disorder, screening for opioid use disorder symptoms in all individuals with POM 
      is also warranted.

TI  - Socioeconomic risk factors for fatal opioid overdoses in the United States:
      Findings from the Mortality Disparities in American Communities Study (MDAC).
LID - e0227966
AB  - Background: Understanding relationships between individual-level demographic,
      socioeconomic status (SES) and U.S. opioid fatalities can inform interventions in
      response to this crisis. Methods: The Mortality Disparities in American Community
      Study (MDAC) links nearly 4 million 2008 American Community Survey responses to
      the 2008–2015 National Death Index. Univariate and multivariable models were used
      to estimate opioid overdose fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). Results: Opioid overdose was an overrepresented cause of death
      among people 10 to 59 years of age. In multivariable analysis, compared to
      Hispanics, Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives had elevated risk (HR =
      2.52, CI:2.21–2.88) and (HR = 1.88, CI:1.35–2.62), respectively. Compared to
      women, men were at-risk (HR = 1.61, CI:1.50–1.72). People who were disabled were 
      at higher risk than those who were not (HR = 2.80, CI:2.59–3.03). Risk was higher
      among widowed than married (HR = 2.44, CI:2.03–2.95) and unemployed than employed
      individuals (HR = 2.46, CI:2.17–2.79). Compared to adults with graduate degrees, 
      those with high school only were at-risk (HR = 2.48, CI:2.00–3.06). Citizens were
      more likely than noncitizens to die from this cause (HR = 4.62, CI:3.48–6.14).
      Compared to people who owned homes with mortgages, those who rented had higher
      HRs (HR = 1.36, CI:1.25–1.48). Non-rural residents had higher risk than rural
      residents (HR = 1.46, CI:1.34, 1.59). Compared to respective referent groups,
      people without health insurance (HR = 1.30, CI:1.20–1.41) and people who were
      incarcerated were more likely to die from opioid overdoses (HR = 2.70,
      CI:1.91–3.81). Compared to people living in households at least five-times above 
      the poverty line, people who lived in poverty were more likely to die from this
      cause (HR = 1.36, CI:1.20–1.54). Compared to people living in West North Central 
      states, HRs were highest among those in South Atlantic (HR = 1.29, CI:1.11, 1.50)
      and Mountain states (HR = 1.58, CI:1.33, 1.88). Discussion: Opioid fatality was
      associated with indicators of low SES. The findings may help to target
      prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts to vulnerable groups.

TI  - Women’s Perspectives On Provider Education Regarding Opioid Use.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - Objective: To elucidate women’s experiences with opioid medications and their
      perspectives on provider education regarding opioid use, risks and safety.
      Methods: Women with a self-reported history of pain who had been prescribed
      opioids were recruited in 2016 using a convenience sampling approach that
      included an online social media campaign. Participants (N=154) completed online
      surveys and open-ended questions regarding their experiences with pain and
      opioids, and their perspectives on the quality of education they received from
      their providers. Results: Participants reported receiving insufficient education 
      about opioid-related side effects, as reflected in both ratings for the quantity 
      and quality of education they received from their providers. Non-white
      participants reported lower quantity and poorer quality of provider education
      (p<0.05). Themes identified from the qualitative data included frustrations with 
      pain management options, fear of opioids, stigma associated with opioid use, and 
      the need for improved provider education and patient-provider communication.
      Conclusion: Findings suggest that from a patient’s perspective, there is a need
      for enhanced patient-provider communication and education regarding pain
      management and potential opioid-related side effects. Improved physician
      communication and education could promote shared decision-making and result in
      enhanced satisfaction with care and health outcomes.

TI  - Opioid-induced immunosuppression and carcinogenesis promotion theories create the
      newest trend in acute and chronic pain pharmacotherapy.
LID - e1554
AB  - Opioids are the main group of pharmacological agents used during the
      perioperative period and provide a sedative and analgesic component. The
      observations of opioid consumption in West Europe indicate that this group of
      drugs is widely used in chronic noncancer pain therapy.Nearly 20 years ago, the
      first publications indicating that opioids, as an element of perioperative
      pharmacotherapy in oncologic patients, increase the risk of tumor recurrence and 
      affect further prognosis were presented. The actual publications suggest that
      there are multifactorial, complex mechanisms underlying the immunological impact 
      and carcinogenesis promotion of opioids and that the intensity varies depending
      on the type of opioid. There are also questions about the immunosuppressive
      effects among patients receiving opioids in the treatment of chronic noncancer
      pain.The aim of the review article is to present information about the action of 
      opioids on the immune system in carcinogenic settings and to define the clinical 
      usefulness of this pharmacological phenomenon.

TI  - Risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations: a qualitative study of the perspectives of Australian general
      practitioners.
LID - e034363
AB  - Objective: To explore the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) concerning 
      the risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations. Design: A qualitative approach using semistructured telephone
      interviews. Analysis used an integrative approach. Setting: Primary care.
      Participants: Australian GPs with experience of prescribing opioids for people
      with cancer and pain. Results: Twenty-two GPs participated, and three themes
      emerged. Theme 1 (Misuse is not the main problem) contextualised misuse as a
      relatively minor concern compared with pain control and toxicity, and highlighted
      underlying systemic factors, including limitations in continuity of care and
      doctor expertise. Theme 2 (‘A different mindset’ for cancer pain) captured
      participants’ relative comfort in prescribing opioids for pain in cancer versus
      non-cancer contexts, and acknowledgement that compassion and greater perceived
      community acceptance were driving factors, in addition to scientific support for 
      mechanisms and clinical efficacy. Participant attitudes towards prescribing for
      people with cancer versus non-cancer pain differed most when cancer was in the
      palliative phase, when they were unconcerned by misuse. Participants were
      equivocal about the risk–benefit ratio of long-term opioid therapy in the chronic
      phase of cancer, and were reluctant to prescribe for disease-free survivors.
      Theme 3 (‘The question is always, ‘how lazy have you been?’) captured
      participants’ acknowledgement that they sometimes prescribed opioids for cancer
      pain as a default, easier option compared with more holistic pain management.
      Conclusions: Findings highlight the role of specific clinical considerations in
      distinguishing risk of opioid misuse in the cancer versus non-cancer population, 
      rather than diagnosis per se. Further efforts are needed to ensure continuity of 
      care where opioid prescribing is shared. Greater evidence is needed to guide
      opioid prescribing in disease-free survivors and the chronic phase of cancer,
      especially in the context of new treatments for metastatic disease.

TI  - The Use of Opioids and Antipsychotics in Elderly with Dementia – Have Opioids
      Replaced Antipsychotics in Treating Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia?
PG  - 259-67
AB  - Background:: Opioids are used with increasing frequency. Elderly with dementia
      are prescribed opioids more frequent than elderly without. One possible
      explanation is that opioids may be used not only to treat pain but also
      behavioral symptoms. Objective:: To test the hypothesis that strong opioid use,
      especially transdermal formulations, had increased, especially in elderly with
      dementia, in parallel with a decrease in antipsychotic use. Methods::
      Population-based cross-sectional study conducted using nationwide Danish
      registers with data on Denmark’s entire elderly population age ≥65 (2000:
      n = 802,106; 2015: n = 1,056,476). The registers were used to identify elderly
      with and without dementia and filled prescriptions for opioids and
      antipsychotics. Annual prevalence of opioid and antipsychotic use from 2000–2015 
      was calculated. Results:: Prevalence of opioid use increased by 35% (24.2 to
      32.5%) among elderly with dementia and by 13% among elderly without (14.9 to
      16.8%) from 2000–2015. The disproportionate increase in opioid use among elderly 
      with dementia was mainly driven by an increase in strong opioids (dementia: 11.7 
      to 23.1%; without dementia: 5.9 to 7.4%). Use of antipsychotics decreased during 
      the same period (dementia: 31.3 to 19.3%; no dementia: 4.5 to 2.7%). Conclusion::
      From 2000–2015, use of opioids among the elderly increased with a
      disproportionately higher increase among elderly with dementia. The parallel
      decrease in the use of antipsychotics may suggest that opioids to some extent
      have replaced antipsychotics in managing behavioral symptoms, despite safety
      concerns and lack of evidence for effect of opioids. Future research should focus
      on potential risks associated with increased opioid use.

TI  - Investigating opioid-related fatalities in southern Sweden: contact with
      care-providing authorities and comparison of substances.
LID - 5
AB  - Background: Opioid-related deaths have increased in Western countries over recent
      decades. Despite numerous studies investigating opioid-related mortality, only a 
      few have focused on the lives of the deceased individuals prior to their deaths, 
      specifically regarding contact with care-providing authorities such as health,
      social and correctional services. Furthermore, a change has been noted in the
      last two decades as to which opioids cause most deaths, from heroin to
      prescription opioids. However, studies comparing fatalities caused by different
      substances are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate contact with
      care-providing authorities during the year prior to death among individuals who
      died as a result of opioid intoxication and to analyse differences relating to
      which opioids caused their deaths. Methods: The study is based on retrospective
      register data and includes 180 individuals with a history of illicit drug use,
      who died from opioid intoxication in Skåne, Sweden, between 1 January 2012 to 31 
      December 2013 and 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. Intoxications caused by heroin,
      methadone, buprenorphine and fentanyl were included. Data were collected from the
      National Board of Forensic Medicine, regional health care services, municipal
      social services and the Prison and Probation Service. Statistical testing was
      performed using Pearson’s chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test and the
      Mann-Whitney U test to analyse group differences. Results: A total of 89% of the 
      deceased individuals had been in contact with one or more of the care-providing
      authorities during the year prior to death; 75% had been in contact with health
      care, 69% with the social services, 28% with the Prison and Probation Service,
      and 23% had been enrolled in opioid substitution treatment at some point during
      their final year of life. Few differences appeared between the substance groups
      with regard to which opioid contributed to the death. In addition to opioids,
      sedatives were present in more than 80% of the cases. Individuals whose deaths
      were buprenorphine-related had been in contact with the social services to a
      significantly lesser extent during the year prior to death. Conclusions: The
      studied population is characterised by extensive contact with care-providing
      authorities, thus providing numerous opportunities for authorities to reach this 
      group with preventive and other interventions. Few differences emerged between
      groups with regard to which opioid had contributed to the death.

TI  - Opioid versus opioid-free analgesia after surgical discharge: protocol for a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - e035443
AB  - Introduction: Excessive prescribing after surgery has contributed to a public
      health crisis of opioid addiction and overdose in North America. However, the
      value of prescribing opioids to manage postoperative pain after surgical
      discharge remains unclear. We propose a systematic review and meta-analysis to
      assess the extent to which opioid analgesia impact postoperative pain intensity
      and adverse events in comparison to opioid-free analgesia in patients discharged 
      after surgery. Methods and analysis: Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase,
      Cochrane Library, Scopus, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL and PsycINFO) will be searched for
      multi-dose randomised-trials examining the comparative effectiveness of opioid
      versus opioid-free analgesia after surgical discharge. Studies published from
      January 1990 to July 2019 will be targeted, with no language restrictions. The
      search will be re-run before manuscript submission to include most recent
      literature. We will consider studies involving patients undergoing minor and
      major surgery. Teams of reviewers will, independently and in duplicate, assess
      eligibility, extract data and evaluate risk of bias. Our main outcomes of
      interest are pain intensity and postoperative vomiting. Study results will be
      pooled using random effects models. When trials report outcomes for a common
      domain (eg, pain intensity) using different scales, we will convert effect sizes 
      to a common standard metric (eg, Visual Analogue Scale). Minimally important
      clinical differences reported in previous literature will be considered when
      interpreting results. Subgroup analyses defined a priori will be conducted to
      explore heterogeneity. Risk of bias will be assessed according to the Cochrane
      Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. The quality of evidence for all outcomes
      will be evaluated using the GRADE rating system. Ethics and dissemination:
      Ethical approval is not required since this is a systematic review of published
      studies. Our results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented
      at relevant conferences. Further knowledge dissemination will be sought via
      public and patient organisations focussed on pain and opioid-related harms.

TI  - Prescription Drug Misuse: Taking a Lifespan Perspective.
LID - 1178221820909352
AB  - Prescription drug misuse (PDM), or medication use without a prescription or in
      ways not intended by the prescriber, is a notable public health concern,
      especially in the United States. Accumulating research has characterized PDM
      prevalence and processes, but age-based or lifespan changes in PDM are
      understudied. Given age-based differences in the medical or developmental
      concerns that often underlie PDM, it is likely that PDM varies by age. This
      review summarizes the literature on PDM across the lifespan, examining lifespan
      changes in prevalence, sources, motives and correlates for opioid, stimulant, and
      tranquilizer/sedative (or benzodiazepine) PDM. In all, prevalence rates, sources 
      and motives vary considerably by age group, with fewer age-based differences in
      correlates or risk factors. PDM prevalence rates tend to decline with aging, with
      greater use of physician sources and greater endorsement of self-treatment
      motives in older groups. Recreational motives (such as to get high) tend to peak 
      in young adulthood, with greater use of peer sources or purchases to obtain
      medication for PDM in younger groups. PDM co-occurs with other substance use and 
      psychopathology, including suicidality, across age groups. The evidence for
      lifespan variation in PDM is strongest for opioid PDM, with a need for more
      research on tranquilizer/sedative and stimulant PDM. The current literature is
      limited by the few studies of lifespan changes in PDM within a single sample, a
      lack of longitudinal research, little research addressing PDM in the context of
      polysubstance use, and little research on minority groups, such as sexual and
      gender minorities.

TI  - Opioid drug use in emergency and adverse outcomes among patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease: a multicenter observational study.
LID - 5038
AB  - There is still debate as to the safety of non-palliative opioid administration to
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients punctually treated for an
      acute complaint. All patients over 40 presenting at two university hospital
      emergency departments (Montréal Qc, Grenoble Fr) from March 2008 to September
      2014 with dyspnea, abdominal pain or trauma were retrieved, and COPD patients
      were selected. Our primary endpoint was a composite criterion including invasive 
      ventilation and death. Comparisons between visits in which opioid drugs were
      prescribed and those without opioids were performed using an inverse probability 
      of treatment and censoring weight (IPTCW) estimator to adjust for baseline
      confounders. A survival weighted Cox model was used. 7799 visits by COPD patients
      were identified, corresponding to 4173 unique patients. Opioid drug prescription 
      was reported in 1317 (16.9%) visits. After applying IPCTW weighting, opioid
      prescription was found to be associated with the composite criterion of poor
      clinical outcomes (HR = 4.73 (2.94; 7.61), p < 0.01). When taken separately, this
      association remained significant for invasive ventilation and death, but not for 
      NIV. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the association, except for patients with
      trauma or abdominal pain as the main complaint. This excess risk is observed
      whatever the route of administration.

TI  - Developing a clinical decision support for opioid use disorders: a NIDA center
      for the clinical trials network working group report.
LID - 4
AB  - There is an urgent need for strategies to address the US epidemic of prescription
      opioid, heroin and fentanyl-related overdoses, misuse, addiction, and diversion. 
      Evidence-based treatment such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are
      available but lack numbers of providers offering these services to meet the
      demands. Availability of electronic health record (EHR) systems has greatly
      increased and led to innovative quality improvement initiatives but this has not 
      yet been optimized to address the opioid epidemic or to treat opioid use disorder
      (OUD). This report from a clinical decision support (CDS) working group convened 
      by the NIDA Center for the Clinical Trials Network aims to converge electronic
      technology in the EHR with the urgent need to improve screening, identification, 
      and treatment of OUD in primary care settings through the development of a CDS
      algorithm that could be implemented as a tool in the EHR. This aim is consistent 
      with federal, state and local government and private sector efforts to improve
      access and quality of MOUD treatment for OUD, existing clinical quality and HEDIS
      measures for OUD or drug and alcohol use disorders, and with a recent draft grade
      B recommendation from the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) for
      screening for illicit drug use in adults when appropriate diagnosis, treatment
      and care services can be offered or referred. Through a face-to-face expert panel
      meeting and multiple follow-up conference calls, the working group drafted CDS
      algorithms for clinical care felt to be essential for screening, diagnosis, and
      management of OUD in primary care. The CDS algorithm was reviewed by addiction
      specialists and primary care providers and revised based on their input. A
      clinical decision support tool for OUD screening, assessment, and treatment
      within primary care systems may help improve healthcare delivery to help address 
      the current epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose that has outpaced the capacity
      of specialized treatment settings. A semi-structured outline of clinical decision
      support for OUD was developed to facilitate implementation within the EHR.
      Further work for adaptation at specific sites and for testing is needed.

TI  - Canadian Guidelines on Opioid Use Disorder Among Older Adults.
PG  - 123-34
AB  - Background: In Canada, rates of hospital admission from opioid overdose are
      higher for older adults (≥ 65) than younger adults, and opioid use disorder (OUD)
      is a growing concern. In response, Health Canada commissioned the Canadian
      Coalition of Seniors’ Mental Health to create guidelines for the prevention,
      screening, assessment, and treatment of OUD in older adults. Methods: A
      systematic review of English language literature from 2008–2018 regarding OUD in 
      adults was conducted. Previously published guidelines were evaluated using AGREE 
      II, and key guidelines updated using ADAPTE method, by drawing on current
      literature. Recommendations were created and assessed using the GRADE method.
      Results: Thirty-two recommendations were created. Prevention recommendations: it 
      is key to prioritize non-pharmacological and non-opioid strategies to treat acute
      and chronic noncancer pain. Assessment recommendations: a comprehensive
      assessment is important to help discern contributions of other medical
      conditions. Treatment recommendations: buprenorphine is first line for both
      withdrawal management and maintenance therapy, while methadone, slow-release oral
      morphine, or naltrexone can be used as alternatives under certain circumstances; 
      non-pharmacological treatments should be offered as an integrated part of care.
      Conclusion: These guidelines provide practical and timely clinical
      recommendations on the prevention, assessment, and treatment of OUD in older
      adults within the Canadian context.

TI  - Chronic pain diagnoses and opioid dispensings among insured individuals with
      serious mental illness.
LID - 40
AB  - Background: Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder
      (BD) have particularly high rates of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) and are also 
      more likely to receive prescription opioids for their pain. However, there have
      been no known studies published to date that have examined opioid treatment
      patterns among individuals with schizophrenia. Methods: Using electronic medical 
      record data across 13 Mental Health Research Network sites, individuals with
      diagnoses of MDD (N = 65,750), BD (N = 38,117) or schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder (N = 12,916) were identified and matched on age, sex and
      Medicare status to controls with no documented mental illness. CNCP diagnoses and
      prescription opioid medication dispensings were extracted for the matched
      samples. Multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate (1) the odds of
      receiving a pain-related diagnosis and (2) the odds of receiving opioids, by
      separate mental illness diagnosis category compared with matched controls,
      controlling for age, sex, Medicare status, race/ethnicity, income, medical
      comorbidities, healthcare utilization and chronic pain diagnoses. Results:
      Multivariable models indicated that having a MDD (OR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.85–1.95) 
      or BD (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.66–1.77) diagnosis was associated with increased
      odds of a CNCP diagnosis after controlling for age, sex, race, income, medical
      comorbidities and healthcare utilization. By contrast, having a schizophrenia
      diagnosis was associated with decreased odds of receiving a chronic pain
      diagnosis (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.82–0.90). Having a MDD (OR = 2.59; 95%
      CI = 2.44–2.75) or BD (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.97–2.28) diagnosis was associated
      with increased odds of receiving chronic opioid medications, even after
      controlling for age, sex, race, income, medical comorbidities, healthcare
      utilization and chronic pain diagnosis; having a schizophrenia diagnosis was not 
      associated with receiving chronic opioid medications. Conclusions: Individuals
      with serious mental illness, who are most at risk for developing opioid-related
      problems, continue to be prescribed opioids more often than their peers without
      mental illness. Mental health clinicians may be particularly well-suited to lead 
      pain assessment and management efforts for these patients. Future research is
      needed to evaluate the effectiveness of involving mental health clinicians in
      these efforts.

TI  - Social media as an emerging tool for reducing prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors.
LID - e03471
AB  - Interventions are urgently needed to reduce prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors, including anxiety and concomitant use of sedatives. However, only a
      limited number of randomized controlled opioid intervention trials have been
      conducted. We sought to determine whether an online behavior change/support
      community, compared to a control Facebook group, could reduce anxiety and opioid 
      misuse among chronic pain patients. 51 high-risk non-cancer chronic pain patients
      were randomly assigned to either a Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE)
      peer-led online behavior change intervention or a control group (no peer leaders)
      on Facebook for 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria were: 18 years or older, a UCLA
      Health System patient, prescribed an opioid for non-cancer chronic pain between 3
      and 12 months ago, and a score of ≥9 on the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) 
      and/or concomitant use of benzodiazepines. Participation in the online community 
      was voluntary. Patients completed baseline and follow-up assessments on
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder screener (GAD-7), COMM, and frequency of social
      media discussions about pain and opioid use. Compared to control group
      participants, intervention participants showed a baseline-to-follow-up decrease
      in anxiety, and more frequently used social media to discuss pain, prescription
      opioid use, coping strategies, places to seek help, and alternative therapies for
      pain. Both groups showed a baseline to follow-up decrease in COMM score.
      Preliminary results support the use an online community interventions as a
      low-cost tool to decrease risk for prescription opioid misuse and its
      complications.

TI  - A215 PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE ARE FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED OPIOID
      ANALGESICS WHEN DISCHARGED FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.
PG  - 88-9
AB  - Background: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer a substantial
      burden of morbidity related to chronic abdominal pain and are susceptible to
      opioid dependence and abuse that is associated with increased rates of
      depression, hospitalization, and mortality. While opioid prescription and renewal
      by a single provider minimizes the long-term risk of misuse, many patients with
      IBD will seek out care in the emergency department (ED) where short-term, ‘to-go’
      use of narcotic analgesia is associated with potential treatment-related
      complications. Aims: To assess rates of opioid prescription in IBD patients
      presenting to the ED and to assess factors associated with opioid use. Methods:
      This is a retrospective analysis of cross-sectional data collected in the United 
      States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2006–2015. 
      We compared a study population of adult IBD patients (International
      Classification of Diseases ICD-9 555.X, 556.X) ≥18 years discharged from the ED
      to a control group of patients presenting with non-specific abdominal pain (ICD-9
      789.0, 564.1, 536.8). The proportion of patients given opioids in ED and at ED
      discharge were calculated with relative standard error (RSE), and national level 
      estimates were produced using survey weights. Univariable and multivariable
      logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of opioid prescription at
      discharge, expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
      Results: A total of 767,577 IBD patients were compared to 71,359,257 patients
      with non-specific abdominal pain. A total of 37.3% (RSE 4.7%) of IBD patients
      compared to 24.7% (RSE 0.8%) of controls (p<0.01) received an opioid prescription
      on ED discharge. 49.1% (RSE 5.6%) of IBD patients compared to 37.2% (RSE 0.8%) of
      patients with non-specific abdominal pain (p=0.02) received an opioid while in
      ED. Significant predictors of narcotic prescription at discharge in multivariable
      analysis included: age <50 (OR 6.83 [95% CI: 1.21, 38.48], p=0.03), non-white
      race (OR 4.73 [95% CI: 1.46, 15.39], p=0.01), and narcotic use in the ED (OR 5.27
      [95% CI: 1.96, 14.21], p<0.01). Conclusions: Nearly 40% of IBD patients were
      prescribed an opioid at discharge from the ED. This rate is significantly higher 
      than for patients who present with non-specific abdominal pain and younger,
      non-white IBD patients were disproportionately more likely to receive an opioid
      prescription. Given the risks associated with on-demand narcotic use in IBD
      patients, our data highlight a potential gap in care for accessing comprehensive 
      pain management solutions.Table 1.Survey weighted baseline demographic

TI  - Drivers of the opioid crisis: An appraisal of financial conflicts of interest in 
      clinical practice guideline panels at the peak of opioid prescribing.
LID - e0227045
AB  - Background: Starting in the late 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry sought to
      increase prescribing of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Influencing the
      content of clinical practice guidelines may have been one strategy industry
      employed. In this study we assessed potential risk of bias from financial
      conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry in guidelines for opioid
      prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain published between 2007 and 2013, the peak
      of opioid prescribing. Methods: We used the Guideline Panel Review (GPR) to
      appraise the guidelines included in the 2014 systematic review and critical
      appraisal by Nuckols et al. These were English language opioid prescribing
      guidelines for adults with chronic non-cancer pain published between July 2007
      and July 2013, the peak of opioid prescribing. The GPR assigns red flags to items
      known to introduce potential bias from financial conflicts of interest. We
      operationalized the GPR by creating specific definitions for each red flag. Two
      reviewers independently evaluated each guideline. Disagreements were resolved
      with discussion. We also compared our score to the critical appraisal scores for 
      overall quality from the study by Nuckols et al. Results: We appraised 13
      guidelines, which received 43 red flags in total. Guidelines had 3.3 red flags on
      average (out of a possible seven) with range from one to six. Four guidelines had
      missing information, so red flags may be higher than reported. The guidelines
      with the highest and second highest scores for overall quality in the 2014
      critical appraisal by Nuckols et al. had five and three red flags, respectively. 
      Conclusion: Our findings reveal that the guidelines for opioid prescribing
      chronic non-cancer pain from 2007 to 2013 were at risk of bias because of
      pervasive conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry and a paucity of
      mechanisms to address bias. Even highly-rated guidelines examined in a 2014
      systematic review and critical appraisal had many red flags.

TI  - Chronic Non-cancer Pain Management and Addiction: A Review.
LID - e6963
AB  - The use of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) has been a fast-rising
      treatment phenomenon in the last two decades. Though opioids are advocated in
      various chronic pain management guidelines, their use in chronic non-cancer pain 
      still remains controversial as evidence of this approach is still weak. This
      paper highlights potential adverse effects associated with opioid use in pain
      management, including an increase in tolerance, dependence, and addiction
      outcomes. Nonetheless, opioids have an important place in contemporary CNCP
      management for selected patients. However, pain management must involve regular
      monitoring and the use of a multimodal pain management strategy. It is essential 
      that the treating physician must be up-to-date with the form of therapy so that
      they have the requisite confidence to prescribe opioids and effectively manage
      adverse effects. Moreover, the adverse effects should be treated promptly to
      enhance patient compliance. Since this approach is beneficial for some patients, 
      opioid treatment should only be applied on a case by case basis.

TI  - Cannabinoids as an Alternative Option for Conventional Analgesics in Cancer Pain 
      Management: A Pharmacogenomics Perspective.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - The global cancer burden is significantly increasing at an alarming rate
      affecting patients, relatives, communities, and health-care system. Cancer
      patients require adequate pain relief and palliative care throughout the life
      course, especially in terminal illness. Although opioid treatment is successful
      in majority of patients, around 40% do not achieve enough analgesia or are prone 
      to serious side effects and toxicity. The treatment of medical conditions with
      cannabis and cannabinoid compounds is constantly expanding. This review organizes
      the current knowledge in the context of SNPs associated with opioids and
      nonopioids and its clinical consequences in pain management and pharmacogenetic
      targets of cannabinoids, for use in clinical practice.

TI  - Responses among substance abuse treatment providers to the opioid epidemic in the
      USA: Variations in buprenorphine and methadone treatment by geography,
      operational, and payment characteristics, 2007-16.
LID - e0229787
AB  - Objective: To identify the geographic, organisational, and payment correlates of 
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment among substance abuse treatment (SAT)
      providers. Methods: Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Substance Abuse 
      Treatment Services (NSSATS) from 2007–16 were conducted. We provide bivariate
      descriptive statistics regarding substance abuse treatment services which offered
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment from 2007–16. Using multiple logistic
      regression, we regressed geographic, organisational, and payment correlates on
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment. Results: Buprenorphine is increasingly
      offered at SAT facilities though uptake remains comparatively low outside of the 
      northeast. SAT facilities run by tribal governments or Indian Health Service
      which offer buprenorphine remain low compared to privately operated SAT
      facilities (AOR = 0.528). The odds of offering buprenorphine among facilities
      offering free or no charge treatment (AOR = 0.838) or a sliding fee scale (AOR = 
      0.464) was lower. SAT facilities accepting Medicaid payments showed higher odds
      of offering methadone treatment (AOR = 2.035). Conclusions: Greater attention
      towards the disparities in provision of opioid agonist therapies is warranted,
      especially towards the reasons why uptake has been moderate among civilian
      providers. Additionally, the care needs of Native Americans facing opioid-related
      use disorders bears further scrutiny.

TI  - Chronic Non-Malignant Pain in Patients with Cancer Seen at a Timely Outpatient
      Palliative Care Clinic.
LID - 214
AB  - Palliative care is seeing cancer patients earlier in the disease trajectory with 
      a multitude of chronic issues. Chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) in cancer
      patients is under-studied. In this prospective study, we examined the prevalence 
      and management of CNMP in cancer patients seen at our supportive care clinic for 
      consultation. We systematically characterized each pain type with the Brief Pain 
      Inventory (BPI) and documented current treatments. The attending physician made
      the pain diagnoses according to the International Association for the Study of
      Pain (IASP) task force classification. Among 200 patients (mean age 60 years, 69%
      metastatic disease, 1-year survival of 77%), the median number of pain diagnosis 
      was 2 (IQR 1–2); 67 (34%, 95% CI 28–41%) had a diagnosis of CNMP; 133 (67%) had
      cancer-related pain; and 52 (26%) had treatment-related pain. In total, 12/31
      (39%) patients with only CNMP and 21/36 (58%) patients with CNMP and other pain
      diagnoses were on opioids. There was a total of 94 CNMP diagnoses among 67
      patients, including 37 (39%) osteoarthritis and 20 (21%) lower back pain; 30
      (32%) were treated with opioids. In summary, CNMP was common in the timely
      palliative care setting and many patients were on opioids. Our findings highlight
      the need to develop clinical guidelines for CNMP in cancer patients to
      standardize its management.

TI  - Desmetramadol Is Identified as a G-Protein Biased µ Opioid Receptor Agonist.
LID - 1680
AB  - Tramadol is widely used globally and is the second most prescribed opioid in the 
      United States. It treats moderate to severe pain but lethal opioid-induced
      respiratory depression is uncommon even in large overdose. It is unknown why
      tramadol spares respiration. Here we show its active metabolite, desmetramadol,
      is as effective as morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl in eliciting G protein
      coupling at the human µ opioid receptor (MOR), but surprisingly, supratherapeutic
      concentrations spare human MOR-mediated βarrestin2 recruitment thought to mediate
      lethal opioid-induced respiratory depression.

TI  - Sexual dysfunction in men on buprenorphine – naloxone-based substitution therapy.
PG  - 66-72
AB  - Background:: The literature on sexual dysfunction in patients on
      buprenorphine-naloxone (BNX) substitution is limited. Materials and Methods::
      This research aimed to study the prevalence and correlates of sexual dysfunction 
      in men on BNX substitution therapy. We recruited consecutive forty men from BNX
      clinic, who had received BNX for at least 6 months, who were free from any recent
      illicit drug use (confirmed by urine chromatographic immune assay), and who were 
      either married or had a stable sexual partner. Men with other psychiatric and
      substance use disorders (except tobacco) were excluded from the study. Data for
      the control group were obtained from a published study (with similar selection
      criteria) from our center. We assessed sexual dysfunction with two
      cross-culturally validated instruments: Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX)
      and International Index of Erectile Function. Results:: The sample had a mean age
      of 31.6 (±8) years; the mean duration of BNX treatment was 9 (±4.2) months and
      the mean BNX dose was 4.5 (±1.6) mg. ASEX showed the prevalence of sexual
      dysfunction to be 40%. The IIEF demonstrated intercourse dissatisfaction (95%)
      and hypoactive sexual desire (92.5%) as almost universal, while 77.5% of the
      participants reported erectile dysfunction. In comparison to the published data, 
      these figures were significantly more than among the controls. We found no
      correlation of sexual dysfunction with marital status, age, duration or dose of
      BNX, duration of illicit opioid use, the severity of opioid dependence, and
      tobacco dependence. Conclusion:: All men on BNX maintenance therapy must be
      screened for sexual dysfunction. With the rapid scaling up of office-based BNX
      substitution, assessment and management of sexual dysfunction ought to be
      incorporated in the training curriculum.

TI  - Dopamine D3 Receptor Antagonism Reverses the Escalation of Oxycodone
      Self-administration and Decreases Withdrawal-Induced Hyperalgesia and
      Irritability-Like Behavior in Oxycodone-Dependent Heterogeneous Stock Rats.
LID - 292
AB  - Prescription opioids, such as oxycodone, are highly effective analgesics for
      clinical pain management, but approximately 25% of patients who are prescribed
      opioids misuse them, and 5%–10% develop an opioid use disorder (OUD). Effective
      therapies for the prevention and treatment of opioid abuse and addiction need to 
      be developed. The present study evaluated the effects of the highly selective
      dopamine D3 receptor antagonist VK4-116
      ([R]-N-[4-(4-[3-chloro-5-ethyl-2-methoxyphenyl]piperazin-1-yl)-3-hydroxybutyl]-1H
      -indole-2-carboxamide) on oxycodone addictive-like behaviors. We used a model of 
      extended access to oxycodone self-administration and tested the effects of
      VK4-116 on the escalation of oxycodone self-administration and withdrawal-induced
      hyperalgesia and irritability-like behavior in male and female rats. Pretreatment
      with VK4-116 (5–25 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently decreased the escalation of
      oxycodone self-administration and reduced withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia and
      irritability-like behavior in opioid-dependent rats. These findings demonstrate a
      key role for D3 receptors in both the motivation to take opioids and negative
      emotional states that are associated with opioid withdrawal and suggest that D3
      receptor antagonism may be a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of
      OUD.

TI  - Matched pilot study examining cannabis-based dronabinol for acute pain following 
      traumatic injury.
LID - e000391
AB  - Background: To determine whether adjunctive dronabinol, a licensed form of
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, reduces opioid consumption when used off-label for 
      managing acute pain following traumatic injury. Methods: This matched cohort
      study included patients who were admitted with a traumatic injury between 1 March
      2017 and 30 October 2017. The hospital pharmacy database was used to identify
      patients who received dronabinol (cases), and they were matched 1:1 to patients
      who did not receive dronabinol (controls) using age, cause of injury and hospital
      length of stay. The primary outcome, change in opioid consumption, was calculated
      using morphine milligram equivalents (MME). The change in MME was calculated for 
      cases as total MME over 48 hours with adjunctive dronabinol minus 48 hours prior 
      to dronabinol, and for controls as total MME 48–96 hours from admission minus
      0–48 hours from admission. Data are presented as mean and SE or median and IQR.
      Statistical analysis was performed using paired t-tests and McNemar’s tests.
      Results: There were 66 patients included: 33 cases and 33 matched controls.
      Dronabinol was initiated 55 (28–107) hours from admission. Cases and controls
      were well matched. Cases had a significant reduction in opioid consumption with
      adjunctive dronabinol (−79 (20) MME, p<0.001), while opioid consumption was
      unchanged for controls (−9 (20) MME, p=0.63). This resulted in a ninefold greater
      reduction in opioid consumption for cases versus controls that was statistically 
      different between pairs (p=0.02). Nineteen (58%) cases reported using marijuana; 
      in this subset, opioid consumption was reduced with adjunctive dronabinol (−97
      (24) MME, p<0.001) versus a non-significant increase in opioid consumption in
      matched controls (11 (29) MME, p=0.70); difference between groups, p=0.01.
      Conclusions: The results of this study suggest adjunctive dronabinol reduces
      opioid consumption following traumatic injury. The opioid-sparing effect of
      dronabinol may be greater in patients who are marijuana users. Level of evidence:

LID - 752
AB  - Introduction: Globally, there is an epidemic of opioid use disorders. Locally, in
      Singapore, there is an increase in the number of individuals abusing opioids. The
      advances in experimental psychology have highlighted the need to modify
      unconscious, automatic biases. These automatic, unconscious biases result in
      individuals having preferential attention to substance-related cues in their
      natural environment, thus leading to a slip or relapse back into their underlying
      addictive disorders. Prior studies have demonstrated not only the presence of
      robust attentional biases amongst individuals with opioid use disorder, even when
      maintained on methadone; and the effectiveness of bias modification amongst these
      individuals. There remains limited evaluation of attention bias modification
      amongst a treatment-seeking cohort of Asian individuals. The objective of this
      pilot is to ensure that the methods of the planned definitive randomized trial
      could be conducted. Methods and Analysis: A non-blinded pilot randomized trial
      will be conducted. A total of 30 participants will be randomized to receive
      either the conventional application or the newly designed co-designed
      application. In order to identify these 30 participants, 60 participants will be 
      recruited and screened to determine if they have baseline biases. Participants
      will be recruited from the inpatient unit at the National Addictions Management
      Service (NAMS) Singapore. All participants who are enrolled into the trial will
      complete a baseline assessment task, and a bias modification assessment and
      modification task daily. They will have to complete a baseline demographic and
      clinical information questionnaire, as well as a cravings rating scale before and
      after the intervention daily. Perspectives—that of self-reported experiences—will
      be sought from the participants following their completion of three intervention 
      tasks. Descriptive statistical analyses will be performed, and chi-square and
      ANOVA analyses will be performed. Qualitative analyses will be undertaken for the
      perspectives shared. Ethics and Dissemination: Ethical approval has been obtained
      from the National Healthcare Group’s Domain Specific Research Board (DSRB)
      (approval number that of 2019/00934). The findings arising from this study will
      be disseminated by means of conferences and publications.

TI  - Mobile Peer-Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine
      Learning Tool.
LID - e200001
AB  - Background:: The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not
      receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access 
      to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs
      turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related 
      information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and
      during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery
      programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as
      reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and 
      scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content
      moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or “trolling”); and lack
      common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care. Methods:: This 
      present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile 
      treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure,
      technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. Forty adults
      receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked to pilot a
      smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the “Marigold App”, for a
      duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study to
      obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative
      interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform.
      Anticipated findings and future directions:: The Marigold mobile platform will
      allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to
      different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and
      constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the
      emotional sentiment in messages, automatically “flagging” critical or clinically 
      relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools 
      by adapting them to catch OUD-specific “flags” in peer messages while also
      examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.

TI  - Mu Opioid Receptor 1 (MOR-1) Expression in Colorectal Cancer and Oncological
      Long-Term Outcomes: A Five-Year Retrospective Longitudinal Cohort Study.
LID - 134
AB  - Preclinical evidence has shown increased expression of mu opioid receptor 1
      (MOR-1) in colorectal cancer although its association with disease-free and
      overall survival (DFS and OS) has not been investigated. We hypothesized that
      MOR-1 was overexpressed in tumor samples compared to normal tissue and this was
      associated with decreased DFS and OS. We carried out a retrospective study
      assessing the association of MOR-1 tumor expression with long-term outcomes by
      immunohistochemistry in normal and tumor samples from 174 colorectal cancer
      patients. The primary endpoint was five years of DFS. Secondary endpoints were
      five years of OS, the difference in MOR-1 expression between normal and tumor
      tissue and the occurrence of postoperative complications. Multivariable Cox
      regression showed no significant association between MOR-1 expression and DFS (HR
      0.791, 95% CI 0.603–1.039, p = 0.092). MOR-1 expression was higher in tumor
      tissue compared to non-tumor tissue. No associations were found between MOR-1
      expression and OS or postoperative complications. These findings suggest that
      although MOR-1 is over-expressed in colorectal cancer samples there is no
      association to increased risk of recurrence or mortality. Future studies are
      warranted to elucidate the role of cancer stage, genetic polymorphism, and
      quantitative assessment of MOR-1 over-expression on long-term outcomes in
      colorectal cancer.

TI  - Unintentional Drug-related Deaths in Cambridgeshire: A Retrospective
      Observational Study.
LID - e6750
AB  - Background: Drug-related deaths are a growing public health problem in the United
      Kingdom, overtaking road fatalities and homicides in terms of annual deaths. In
      this study, we investigated the causes and circumstances of unintentional
      drug-related deaths occurring in the county of Cambridgeshire, with the objective
      of identifying the prevalence of physical, mental, and social health problems
      within this cohort.Methods: We collected data on the demographics and mental and 
      physical health of, and drugs contributing to, 30 consecutive unintentional
      drug-related deaths recorded by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough County
      Council Coroners in 2017. A retrospective observational study was used, and data 
      were collected by manual extraction from coroners’ files.Results: Social
      isolation was identified as a recurring theme amongst the decedents, although
      homelessness was found in very few cases. Pharmacologically, multiple drug
      toxicity and opioid toxicity were highly prevalent, whilst prescription opioids
      were implicated in more cases than heroin. Chronic pain was also highly prevalent
      amongst the decedents, and a history of mental illness was found to occur in the 
      majority of cases.Discussion: Our findings show that reports from the coronial
      system provide a rich narrative to understand the causes of drug-related deaths. 
      We have identified that individuals who die from drug-related deaths frequently
      have multiple adverse physical, mental, and social problems. This implies that
      any attempt to reduce drug-related deaths requires a multi-faceted and
      multi-disciplinary approach.

AB  - The opioid crisis has shaped the national public health dialogue for some time
      now. A “call to action” is a strong and resounding cry from multiple disciplines.
      This piece intends to detail the nuts and bolts of prescribing medications used
      for the treatment of opioid use disorder. The underlying message here is that
      opioid use disorder is a chronic, treatable illness and physicians of all
      specialties have a responsibility to not turn a blind eye.

      retrospective cohort study.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Pain is a common and burdensome complication in patients with acute
      stroke. We assessed the impact of impaired communication in stroke patients on
      pain assessment and treatment. Methods: We included 909 (507 male, mean age
      71.8 years) patients admitted to our stroke unit from 01/2015 to 12/2015 in the
      analysis. Patients were assigned to four groups: able to communicate (AC), not
      able to communicate prior to index stroke (P-NAC), due to focal symptoms of index
      stroke (S-NAC), due to a reduced level of consciousness (C-NAC). Pain prevalence,
      documentation of pain and use of analgesics were evaluated. C-NAC patients were
      excluded from analyses regarding analgesic treatment due to relevant differences 
      in patient characteristics. Results: 746 patients (82.1%) were classified as AC, 
      25 (2.8%) as P-NAC, 90 (9.9%) as S-NAC and 48 (5.3%) as C-NAC. Pain was
      documented on the Numeric Rating Scale and in form of free text by nurses and
      physicians. Nurses documented pain more frequently than physicians (p < 0.001).
      Pain prevalence was 47.0% (n.s. between groups). The use of analgesic medication 
      increased from 48.7% in the AC group, to 76.0% in the P-NAC group, and 77.8% in
      the S-NAC group (p < 0.001). Opioid use was significantly more frequent in NAC
      patients (p < 0.001). The response to the treatment was poorly documented with
      significantly lowest rates in S-NAC patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study 
      suggests that post-stroke pain in patients with inability to communicate is not
      attended enough, not systematically assessed and therefore not sufficiently
      treated.

TI  - Anesthetic Strategies in Oncological Surgery: Not Only a Simple Sleep, but Also
      Impact on Immunosuppression and Cancer Recurrence.
PG  - 931-40
AB  - Tumor recurrences or metastases remain a major hurdle in improving overall cancer
      survival. In the perioperative period, the balance between the ability of the
      cancer to seed and grow at the metastatic site and the ability of the patient to 
      fight against the tumor (i.e. the host antitumor immunity) may determine the
      development of clinically evident metastases and influence the patient outcome.
      Up to 80% of oncological patients receive anesthesia and/or analgesia for
      diagnostic, therapeutic or palliative interventions. Therefore, anesthesiologists
      are asked to administer drugs such as opiates and volatile or intravenous
      anesthetics, which may determine different effects on immunomodulation and cancer
      recurrence. For instance, some studies suggest that intravenous drugs, such as
      propofol, may inhibit the host immunity to a lower extent as compared to volatile
      anesthetics. Similarly, some studies suggest that analgesia assured by local
      anesthetics may provide a reduction of cancer recurrence rate; whilst on the
      opposite side, opioids may exert negative consequences in patients undergoing
      cancer surgery, by interacting with the immune system response via the modulation
      of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system, or
      directly through the opioid receptors on the surface of immune cells. In this
      review, we summarize the main findings on the effects induced by different drugs 
      on immunomodulation and cancer recurrence.

TI  - Estimating the impact of drug use on US mortality, 1999-2016.
LID - e0226732
AB  - The impact of rising drug use on US mortality may extend beyond deaths coded as
      drug-related to include excess mortality from other causes affected by drug use. 
      Here, we estimate the full extent of drug-associated mortality. We use annual
      death rates for 1999–2016 by state, sex, five-year age group, and cause of death 
      to model the relationship between drug-coded mortality—which serves as an
      indicator of the population-level prevalence of drug use—and mortality from other
      causes. Among residents aged 15–64 living in the 50 US states, the estimated
      number of drug-associated deaths in 2016 (141,695) was 2.2 times the number of
      drug-coded deaths (63,000). Adverse trends since 2010 in midlife mortality are
      largely attributable to drug-associated mortality. In the absence of drug use, we
      estimate that the probability of dying between ages 15 and 65 would have
      continued to decline after 2010 among men (to 15% in 2016) and would have
      remained at a low level (10%) among women. Our results suggest that an additional
      3.9% of men and 1.8% of women died between ages 15 and 65 in 2016 because of drug
      use. In terms of life expectancy beyond age 15, we estimate that drug use cost
      men 1.4 years and women 0.7 years, on average. In the hardest-hit state (West
      Virginia), drug use cost men 3.6 and women 1.9 life years. Recent declines in US 
      life expectancy have been blamed largely on the drug epidemic. Consistent with
      that inference, our results imply that, in the absence of drug use, life
      expectancy at age 15 would have increased slightly between 2014 and 2016.
      Drug-associated mortality in the US is roughly double that implied by drug-coded 
      deaths alone. The drug epidemic is exacting a heavy cost to American lives, not
      only from overdoses but from a variety of causes.

TI  - The National Ambulance Surveillance System: A novel method for monitoring acute
      alcohol, illicit and pharmaceutical drug related-harms using coded Australian
      ambulance clinical records.
LID - e0228316
AB  - Although harmful consumption of alcohol and other drugs (both illicit and
      pharmaceutical) significantly contribute to global burden of disease, not all
      harms are captured within existing morbidity data sources. Indeed, harms
      occurring in the community may be missed or under-reported. This paper describes 
      the National Ambulance Surveillance System, a unique Australian system for
      monitoring and mapping acute harms related to alcohol and other drug consumption.
      Data are sourced from paramedic electronic patient care records provided by
      ambulance services from across Australia. Coding occurs in a purpose-built
      system, by a team of specialised research assistants. Alcohol, and specific
      illicit and pharmaceutical drugs, rather than broad drug classes, are manually
      coded and the dataset is reviewed and cleaned prior to analysis. The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an ongoing, dynamic surveillance system of
      alcohol and other drug-related harms across Australia. The data includes more
      than 140 output variables per attendance, including individual substances,
      demographics, temporal, geospatial, and clinical data (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale
      score, naloxone provision and response, outcome of attendance). The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an internationally unique population-level
      surveillance system of acute harms arising from alcohol and other drug
      consumption. Dissemination of National Ambulance Surveillance System data has
      been used to inform and evaluate policy approaches and potential points of
      intervention, as well as guide workforce development needs and clinical practice 
      at the local and national level. This methodology could be replicated in other
      countries.

TI  - Unmet needs of patients with cancer in their last year of life as described by
      caregivers in a developing world setting: a qualitative study.
LID - 13
AB  - Background: Palliative care is in its infancy in most of the developing world. We
      set out to explore the lived experiences of families and caregivers of recently
      deceased cancer patients in Trinidad and Tobago and to determine the unmet needs 
      of the patients and what recommendations could be derived to improve the current 
      services. Methods: A phenomenological approach with purposeful sampling was used.
      Participants were referred by key health professionals. Face-to-face interviews
      were conducted. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, with analysis and data
      collection occurring concurrently. Thematic content analysis was used to
      determine common domains, themes and sub-themes. Results: Interviews were
      completed with 15 caregivers. All were spouses or children of the deceased. Ages 
      of the deceased ranged from 43 to 93, the average being 65.5 years. The deceased 
      experienced a variety of cancers including lung, colorectal and oesophageal.Unmet
      needs were identified under 4 domains of institutions, community, the family unit
      and the wider society. Institutional unmet needs were delayed diagnosis and
      treatment and poor inter-institution coordination. Medical and nursing care
      failed in the areas of health care providers’ attitudes, pain management and
      communication. The family unit lacked physical and psychosocial support for the
      caregiver and financial aid for the family unit. Societal needs were for public
      education to address myths and cultural beliefs around cancer. Conclusion: There 
      is need for systemic interventions to improve the care of those dying from cancer
      in Trinidad and Tobago. Stakeholders need to commit to palliative care as a
      public health priority, implementing education, planning services and mobilizing 
      community resources.

TI  - Illness-related suffering and need for palliative care in Rohingya refugees and
      caregivers in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study.
LID - e1003011
AB  - Background: Despite recognition that palliative care is an essential component of
      any humanitarian response, serious illness-related suffering continues to be
      pervasive in these settings. There is very limited evidence about the need for
      palliative care and symptom relief to guide the implementation of programs to
      alleviate the burden of serious illness-related suffering in these settings. A
      basic package of essential medications and supplies can provide pain relief and
      palliative care; however, the practical availability of these items has not been 
      assessed. This study aimed to describe the illness-related suffering and need for
      palliative care in Rohingya refugees and caregivers in Bangladesh. Methods and
      findings: Between November 20 and 24, 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional study 
      of individuals with serious health problems (n = 156, 53% male) and caregivers (n
      = 155, 69% female) living in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, using
      convenience sampling to recruit participants at the community level (i.e., going 
      house to house to identify eligible individuals). The serious health problems,
      recent healthcare experiences, need for medications and medical supplies, and
      basic needs of participants were explored through interviews with trained
      Rohingya community members, using an interview guide that had been piloted with
      Rohingya individuals to ensure it reflected the specificities of their refugee
      experience and culture. The most common diagnoses were significant physical
      disabilities (n = 100, 64.1%), treatment-resistant tuberculosis (TB) (n = 32,
      20.5%), cancer (n = 15, 9.6%), and HIV infection (n = 3, 1.9%). Many individuals 
      with serious health problems were experiencing significant pain (62%, n = 96),
      and pain treatments were largely ineffective (70%, n = 58). The average age was
      44.8 years (range 2–100 years) for those with serious health problems and 34.9
      years (range 8–75 years) for caregivers. Caregivers reported providing an average
      of 13.8 hours of care per day. Sleep difficulties (87.1%, n = 108), lack of
      appetite (58.1%, n = 72), and lack of pleasure in life (53.2%, n = 66) were the
      most commonly reported problems related to the caregiving role. The main
      limitations of this study were the use of convenience sampling and closed-ended
      interview questioning. Conclusions: In this study we found that many individuals 
      with serious health problems experienced significant physical, emotional, and
      social suffering due to a lack of access to pain and symptom relief and other
      essential components of palliative care. Humanitarian responses should develop
      and incorporate palliative care and symptom relief strategies that address the
      needs of all people with serious illness-related suffering and their caregivers.

TI  - The Prevalence and Clinical Implications of Comorbid Back Pain in Shoulder
      Instability: A Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder
      Instability Cohort Study.
LID - 2325967119894738
AB  - Background:: Understanding predictors of pain is critical, as recent literature
      shows that comorbid back pain is an independent risk factor for worse functional 
      and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as well as increased opioid dependence after
      total joint arthroplasty. Purpose/Hypothesis:: The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate whether comorbid back pain would be predictive of pain or self-reported 
      instability symptoms at the time of stabilization surgery. We hypothesized that
      comorbid back pain will correlate with increased pain at the time of surgery as
      well as with worse scores on shoulder-related PRO measures. Study Design::
      Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods:: As part of the Multicenter
      Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder Instability cohort, patients
      consented to participate in pre- and intraoperative data collection. Demographic 
      characteristics, injury history, preoperative PRO scores, and radiologic and
      intraoperative findings were recorded for patients undergoing surgical shoulder
      stabilization. Patients were also asked, whether they had any back pain.
      Results:: The study cohort consisted of 1001 patients (81% male; mean age, 24.1
      years). Patients with comorbid back pain (158 patients; 15.8%) were significantly
      older (28.1 vs 23.4 years; P < .001) and were more likely to be female (25.3% vs 
      17.4%; P = .02) but did not differ in terms of either preoperative imaging or
      intraoperative findings. Patients with self-reported back pain had significantly 
      worse preoperative pain and shoulder-related PRO scores (American Shoulder and
      Elbow Surgeons score, Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index) (P < .001),
      more frequent depression (22.2% vs 8.3%; P < .001), poorer mental health status
      (worse scores for the RAND 36-Item Health Survey Mental Component Score, Iowa
      Quick Screen, and Personality Assessment Screener) (P < .01), and worse
      preoperative expectations (P < .01). Conclusion:: Despite having similar physical
      findings, patients with comorbid back pain had more severe preoperative pain and 
      self-reported symptoms of instability as well as more frequent depression and
      lower mental health scores. The combination of disproportionate shoulder pain,
      comorbid back pain and mental health conditions, and inferior preoperative
      expectations may affect not only the patient’s preoperative state but also
      postoperative pain control and/or postoperative outcomes.

TI  - Risk factors for pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations in long-term care
      facility residents: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 47
AB  - Background: Older adults who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at
      particularly high risk for infection, morbidity and mortality from pneumonia and 
      influenza (P&I) compared to individuals of younger age and those living outside
      institutional settings. The risk factors for P&I hospitalizations that are
      specific to LTCFs remain poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the
      incidence of P&I hospitalization and associated person- and facility-level
      factors among post-acute (short-stay) and long-term (long-stay) care residents
      residing in LTCFs from 2013 to 2015. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study,
      we used Medicare administrative claims linked to Minimum Data Set and LTCF-level 
      data to identify short-stay (< 100 days, index = admission date) and long-stay
      (100+ days, index = day 100) residents who were followed from the index date
      until the first of hospitalization, LTCF discharge, Medicare disenrollment, or
      death. We measured incidence rates (IRs) for P&I hospitalization per 100,000
      person-days, and estimated associations with baseline demographics, geriatric
      syndromes, clinical characteristics, and medication use using Cox regression
      models. Results: We analyzed data from 1,118,054 short-stay and 593,443 long-stay
      residents. The crude 30-day IRs (95% CI) of hospitalizations with P&I in the
      principal position were 26.0 (25.4, 26.6) and 34.5 (33.6, 35.4) among short- and 
      long-stay residents, respectively. The variables associated with P&I varied
      between short and long-stay residents, and common risk factors included: advanced
      age (85+ years), admission from an acute hospital, select cardiovascular and
      respiratory conditions, impaired functional status, and receipt of antibiotics or
      Beers criteria medications. Facility staffing and care quality measures were
      important risk factors among long-stay residents but not in short-stay residents.
      Conclusions: Short-stay residents had lower crude 30- and 90-day incidence rates 
      of P&I hospitalizations than long-stay LTCF residents. Differences in risk
      factors for P&I between short- and long-stay populations suggest the importance
      of considering distinct profiles of post-acute and long-term care residents in
      infection prevention and control strategies in LTCFs. These findings can help
      clinicians target interventions to subgroups of LTCF residents at highest P&I
      risk.

TI  - Prescription Pattern of Drugs Used for Neuropathic Pain and Adherence to NeuPSIG 
      Guidelines in Cancer.
PG  - 13-8
AB  - Objective:: The objective of the present research was to evaluate the
      prescription pattern of the drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of
      cancer-related neuropathic pain (CRNP) and to assess the adherence of the
      physicians to the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) Guidelines.
      Materials and Methods:: This was a cross-sectional, observational study where
      patients who presented to the pain and palliative care outpatient clinic of the
      tertiary care hospital with CRNP were prospectively recruited. Participants were 
      screened for neuropathic pain using DN4 questionnaire. Demographic details,
      diagnosis, medication details, and adherence to NeuPSIG guidelines were assessed 
      using a validated questionnaire. Results:: Of 300 patients screened, 64% were
      male and 36% were female, with a mean age of 48.26 ± 13.05 years. The predominant
      symptoms found were pin-and-needle sensation (99%) followed by tingling sensation
      (98.66%). The most common diagnosis was head-and-neck cancers (37.3%) followed by
      bone cancers (17.3%) and lung cancers (15.3%). Among the first-line drugs
      recommended in NeuPSIG for CRNP, pregabalin (78.7%) was the most common drug
      prescribed followed by amitriptyline (67%). The most common co-prescribed drugs
      were acid suppressants drugs (50.7%). Tapentadol, which is not part of the
      NeuPSIG guidelines, was prescribed on 51 occasions for neuropathic pain.
      Underdosing was observed in 272 prescriptions. Only 12 prescriptions completely
      adhered, while 275 had partial, and 13 prescriptions had poor adherence to
      NeuPSIG guidelines. Conclusion:: The most commonly used drugs in the treatment of
      CRNP were pregabalin and amitriptyline. Most physician partially or did not
      adhere to the NeuPSIG guideline in the management of CRNP.

TI  - The analgesic efficacy compared ultrasound-guided continuous transverse abdominis
      plane block with epidural analgesia following abdominal surgery: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 52
AB  - Background: This review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the analgesic efficacy
      of continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block compared with epidural
      analgesia (EA) in adults after abdominal surgery. Methods: The databases PubMed, 
      Embase and Cochrane Central Register were searched from inception to June 2019
      for all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the
      analgesic efficacy of continuous TAP block compared with EA after abdominal
      surgery. The weighted mean differences (WMDs) were estimates for continuous
      variables with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous
      data. The pre-specified primary outcome was the dynamic pain scores 24 h
      postoperatively. Results: Eight trials including 453 patients (TAP block:224
      patients; EA: 229 patients) ultimately met the inclusion criteria and seven
      trials were included in the meta-analysis. Dynamic pain scores after 24 h were
      equivalent between TAP block and EA groups (WMD:0.44; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.99;
      I2 = 91%; p = 0.11). The analysis showed a significant difference between the
      subgroups according to regularly administering (4 trials; WMD:-0.11; 95% CI:
      − 0.32 to 0.09; I2 = 0%; p = 0.28) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      or not (3 trials; WMD:1.02; 95% CI: 0.09 to 1.96; I2 = 94%; p = 0.03) for
      adjuvant analgesics postoperatively. The measured time of the urinary catheter
      removal in the TAP group was significantly shorter (3 trials, WMD:-18.95, 95%
      CI:-25.22 to − 12.71; I2 = 0%; p < 0.01), as was time to first ambulation
      postoperatively (4 trials, WMD:-6.61, 95% CI: − 13.03 to − 0.19; I2 = 67%;
      p < 0.05). Conclusion: Continuous TAP block, combined with NSAIDs, can provide
      non-inferior dynamic analgesia efficacy compared with EA in postoperative pain
      management after abdominal surgery. In addition, continuous TAP block is
      associated with fewer postoperative side effects.

TI  - Management of Restless Legs Syndrome in Pregnancy and Lactation.
LID - 2150132720905950
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects about 20% of all pregnant women. RLS
      symptoms are usually moderate to severe in intensity during pregnancy and can
      result in insomnia, depression, and other adverse outcomes. Although iron
      deficiency has been implicated as a potential etiological factor, other
      mechanisms can also play a role. Nonpharmacologic methods are the primary
      recommended form of treatment for RLS in pregnancy and lactation. Iron
      supplementation may be considered when the serum ferritin is low; however,
      several patients are unable to tolerate iron or have severe symptoms despite oral
      iron replacement. Here, we describe a case of severe RLS in pregnancy and
      illustrate the dilemmas in diagnosis and management. We review the literature on 
      the prevalence, diagnosis, course, possible underlying pathophysiologic
      mechanisms and complications of RLS in pregnancy. We describe current best
      evidence on the efficacy, and safety of nonpharmacologic therapies, oral and
      intravenous iron supplementation, as well as other medication treatments for RLS 
      in pregnancy and lactation. We highlight gaps in the literature and provide a
      practical guide for the clinical management of RLS in pregnancy and during
      breastfeeding.

TI  - Consistency between anticholinergic burden scales in the elderly with fractures.
LID - e0228532
AB  - Objective: Falls and bone fractures are important causes of morbidity and
      mortality in the elderly. The objective of this study was to identify the degree 
      of consistency between the anticholinergic scales used for patients diagnosed
      with fractures. Methods: This was an analytical agreement study conducted in
      patients diagnosed with vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in Colombia. The
      quadratic-weighted kappa coefficient was used to identify the consistency between
      the Anticholinergic Drug Scale-ADS, Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale-ACB
      and Anticholinergic Risk Scale-ARS in assessing the prescriptions of fracture
      patients during the month prior to the fracture, during their stay as an
      inpatient and at discharge, according to Landis criteria. Results: 220 patients
      with fractures were included, with a mean age of 75.3±10.3 years, and 68.2% were 
      women. The ACB scale identified the highest anticholinergic burden (26.8%) in
      prescriptions made the month before the fracture, and the highest agreement was
      between ACB and ADS (0.717); during hospitalization and at discharge, the
      cholinergic antagonists were best identified with ADS (77.7% and 72.1%,
      respectively), with the best agreement between ACB and ARS (0.613 and 0.568,
      respectively). The prescription of tramadol was found in 64.1% of hospitalized
      patients and in 61.4% of patients at the time of discharge. Conclusions: The
      scales evaluated show marked discrepancies between them, with highly variable
      frequencies of anticholinergic drugs identified at the different prescription
      times, and with low agreement among them, which is why the scales are not
      interchangeable in patients with bone fractures.

TI  - Mapping of Morphine-Induced OPRM1 Gene Expression Pattern in the Adult Zebrafish 
      Brain.
LID - 5
AB  - Morphine is a potent analgesic opiate commonly used in treating pain, and it is
      also a substance of abuse and highly addictive. Hence, it is vital to discover
      the action sites of morphine in the brain to increase its efficacy of treatment. 
      In the present study, we aimed at identifying comprehensive neuroanatomical
      locations that are sensitive to morphine in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). We
      performed in situ hybridization to localize the mu opioid receptor (oprm1) gene
      and to map the morphine sensitive brain areas using neuronal PAS
      domain-containing protein 4a (npas4a), an early gene marker. Real-time PCR was
      used to detect changes in mRNA levels of oprm1 and npas4a in control and acute
      morphine treated fish (2 mg/L; 20 min). Intense positive oprm1 signals were seen 
      in the telencephalon, preoptic area, habenula, hypothalamic area and
      periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum. Acute morphine exposure
      significantly increased oprm1 and npas4a mRNA levels in the medial zone of dorsal
      telencephalon (Dm), ventral region of the ventral telencephalon (Vv), preoptic
      area, and in the hypothalamus but a decrease in oprm1 and npas4a signals in the
      dorsal habenula. This study provides a detailed map of oprm1 localization in the 
      brain, which includes previously unreported oprm1 in the habenula of teleost.
      Presence of oprm1 in multiple brain sites implies multiple action targets of
      morphine and potential brain functions which could include reward, cognitive and 
      negative emotions.

      incisions – a randomized-controlled pilot trial (Painless-Pilot trial; DRKS
      Number: DRKS00008023).
LID - e0229898
AB  - Objectives: To test the feasibility of a randomized controlled study design
      comparing epidural analgesia (EDA) with continuous wound infiltration (CWI) in
      respect to postoperative complications and mobility to design a future
      multicentre randomized controlled trial. Design, setting, participants: CWI has
      been developed to address drawbacks of EDA. Previous studies have established the
      equivalent analgesic potential of CWI compared to EDA. This is a single centre,
      non-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial at a tertiary surgical centre.
      Patients undergoing elective non-colorectal surgery via a midline laparotomy were
      randomized to EDA or CWI. Endpoints included recruitment, feasibility of
      assessing postoperative mobility with a pedometer and morbidity. No primary
      endpoint was defined and all analyses were explorative. Interventions: CWI with
      local anaesthetics (experimental group) vs. thoracic EDA (control). Results: Of
      846 patients screened within 14 months, 71 were randomized and 62 (31 per group) 
      included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Mobility was assessed in 44 of 62
      patients and revealed no differences within the first 3 postoperative days.
      Overall morbidity did not differ between the two groups (measured via the
      comprehensive complication index). Median pain scores at rest were comparable
      between the two groups, while EDA was superior in pain treatment during movement 
      on the first, but not on the second and third postoperative day. Duration of
      preoperative induction of anaesthesia was shorter with CWI than with EDA. Of 17
      serious adverse events, 3 were potentially related to EDA, while none was related
      to CWI. Conclusion: This trial confirmed the feasibility of a randomized trial
      design to compare CWI and EDA regarding morbidity. Improvements in the education 
      and training of team members are necessary to improve recruitment. Trial
      registration: DRKS00008023.

LID - 00331-2019
AB  - The Respiratory Intensive Care Assembly of the European Respiratory Society is
      delighted to present the highlights from the 2019 International Congress in
      Madrid, Spain. We have selected four sessions that discussed recent advances in a
      wide range of topics: from acute respiratory failure to cough augmentation in
      neuromuscular disorders and from extra-corporeal life support to difficult
      ventilator weaning. The subjects are summarised by early career members in close 
      collaboration with the Assembly leadership. We aim to give the reader an update
      on the most important developments discussed at the conference. Each session is
      further summarised into a short list of take-home messages.

TI  - The Operant Plantar Thermal Assay: A Novel Device for Assessing Thermal Pain
      Tolerance in Mice.
LID - ENEURO.0210-19.2020
AB  - Pain is a multidimensional experience of sensory-discriminative, cognitive, and
      affective processes; however, current basic research methods rely heavily on
      response to threshold stimuli, bypassing the supraspinal processing that
      ultimately gives rise to the pain experience. We developed the operant plantar
      thermal assay (OPTA), which utilizes a novel, conflict-based operant task
      requiring evaluation and active decision-making to obtain reward under thermally 
      aversive conditions to quantify thermal pain tolerance. In baseline measures,
      male and female mice exhibited similar temperature preferences, however in the
      OPTA, female mice exhibited greater temperature-dependent tolerance, as defined
      by choice time spent in an adverse thermal condition to obtain reward. Increasing
      reward salience (4% vs 10% sucrose solution) led to increased thermal tolerance
      for males but not females. To determine whether neuropathic and inflammatory pain
      models alter thermal tolerance, animals with chronic constriction injury (CCI) or
      complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), respectively, were tested in the OPTA.
      Surprisingly, neuropathic animals exhibited increased thermal tolerance, as shown
      by greater time spent in the reward zone in an adverse thermal condition,
      compared with sham animals. There was no effect of inflammation on thermal
      tolerance. Administration of clonidine in the CCI model led to increased thermal 
      tolerance in both injured and sham animals. In contrast, the non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory meloxicam was anti-hyperalgesic in the CFA model, but reduced
      thermal pain tolerance. These data support the feasibility of using the OPTA to
      assess thermal pain tolerance to gain new insights into complex pain behaviors
      and to investigate novel aspects of analgesic efficacy.

TI  - Social media as an emerging tool for reducing prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors.
LID - e03471
AB  - Interventions are urgently needed to reduce prescription opioid misuse risk
      factors, including anxiety and concomitant use of sedatives. However, only a
      limited number of randomized controlled opioid intervention trials have been
      conducted. We sought to determine whether an online behavior change/support
      community, compared to a control Facebook group, could reduce anxiety and opioid 
      misuse among chronic pain patients. 51 high-risk non-cancer chronic pain patients
      were randomly assigned to either a Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE)
      peer-led online behavior change intervention or a control group (no peer leaders)
      on Facebook for 12 weeks. Inclusion criteria were: 18 years or older, a UCLA
      Health System patient, prescribed an opioid for non-cancer chronic pain between 3
      and 12 months ago, and a score of ≥9 on the Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) 
      and/or concomitant use of benzodiazepines. Participation in the online community 
      was voluntary. Patients completed baseline and follow-up assessments on
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder screener (GAD-7), COMM, and frequency of social
      media discussions about pain and opioid use. Compared to control group
      participants, intervention participants showed a baseline-to-follow-up decrease
      in anxiety, and more frequently used social media to discuss pain, prescription
      opioid use, coping strategies, places to seek help, and alternative therapies for
      pain. Both groups showed a baseline to follow-up decrease in COMM score.
      Preliminary results support the use an online community interventions as a
      low-cost tool to decrease risk for prescription opioid misuse and its
      complications.

TI  - Efficacy of local infiltration analgesia with ropivacaine for postoperative pain 
      management in cervical laminoplasty: a retrospective study.
LID - 4217
AB  - Poor postoperative pain control impairs patient recovery and lengthens the
      duration of hospitalization after various surgeries. Local infiltration
      analgesia(LIA) has become an effective method for managing postoperative pain.
      This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of LIA with ropivacaine for
      postoperative pain control after cervical laminoplasty. In total, 68 patients
      undergoing cervical laminoplasty were included for retrospective review and
      divided into ropivacaine and control groups. The visual analogue scale (VAS)
      score, postoperative analgesic consumption, operative duration, intraoperative
      blood loss volume, incision length, hospitalization duration and incidence of
      complications were analyzed. In the ropivacaine group, the VAS score was
      3.2 ± 1.4 at 4 hours postoperatively, which was lower than that of the control
      group(4.0 ± 1.4, P = 0.024). At 8, 12 and 24 hours after surgery, a significant
      difference was detected in the VAS score between the two groups(P ≤ 0.015).
      Sufentanil consumption was less in the ropivacaine group than in the control
      group in the first 4 hours postoperatively (25.6 ± 6.3 µg vs 32.2 ± 6.8 µg,
      P < 0.001), and similar results were observed in the first 8, 12, 24, 48 and
      72 hours postoperatively(P < 0.001). Fewer patients required rescue analgesia in 
      the ropivacaine group(8/33 vs 18/35 at 4–8 hours, P = 0.021; 9/33 vs 21/35 at
      8–12 hours, P = 0.007). The hospitalization duration and time to ambulation were 
      shorter in the ropivacaine group(8.5 ± 1.4 vs 9.6 ± 1.6 for postoperative
      duration, P = 0.002; 2.9 ± 0.7 vs 3.5 ± 0.8 for time to ambulation, P = 0.001).
      The incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower in the ropivacaine group than in
      the control group(30.3% vs 54.3%, P = 0.046). In conclusion, LIA with ropivacaine
      could effectively reduce postoperative pain, and postoperative analgesic
      consumption, and promote recovery after cervical laminoplasty.

TI  - Continuous wound infiltration versus epidural analgesia for midline abdominal
      incisions – a randomized-controlled pilot trial (Painless-Pilot trial; DRKS
      Number: DRKS00008023).
LID - e0229898
AB  - Objectives: To test the feasibility of a randomized controlled study design
      comparing epidural analgesia (EDA) with continuous wound infiltration (CWI) in
      respect to postoperative complications and mobility to design a future
      multicentre randomized controlled trial. Design, setting, participants: CWI has
      been developed to address drawbacks of EDA. Previous studies have established the
      equivalent analgesic potential of CWI compared to EDA. This is a single centre,
      non-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial at a tertiary surgical centre.
      Patients undergoing elective non-colorectal surgery via a midline laparotomy were
      randomized to EDA or CWI. Endpoints included recruitment, feasibility of
      assessing postoperative mobility with a pedometer and morbidity. No primary
      endpoint was defined and all analyses were explorative. Interventions: CWI with
      local anaesthetics (experimental group) vs. thoracic EDA (control). Results: Of
      846 patients screened within 14 months, 71 were randomized and 62 (31 per group) 
      included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Mobility was assessed in 44 of 62
      patients and revealed no differences within the first 3 postoperative days.
      Overall morbidity did not differ between the two groups (measured via the
      comprehensive complication index). Median pain scores at rest were comparable
      between the two groups, while EDA was superior in pain treatment during movement 
      on the first, but not on the second and third postoperative day. Duration of
      preoperative induction of anaesthesia was shorter with CWI than with EDA. Of 17
      serious adverse events, 3 were potentially related to EDA, while none was related
      to CWI. Conclusion: This trial confirmed the feasibility of a randomized trial
      design to compare CWI and EDA regarding morbidity. Improvements in the education 
      and training of team members are necessary to improve recruitment. Trial
      registration: DRKS00008023.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of DAAs in HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coinfected
      patients with psychiatric disorders.
LID - 196
AB  - Background: Few data are available regarding the use of direct antiviral agents
      (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C in psychiatric patients. The aim of the study is
      to assess safety and outcome of DAAs in patients with psychiatric comorbidities. 
      Methods: This retrospective, observational, single-centre study enrolled patients
      treated with psychiatric drugs who initiated DAAs between 2015 and 2018. Patients
      were classified into two groups: A (on anxiolitycs/antidepressant) and B (on
      antipsychotics). Week-12 sustained virological response (SVR-12) and adverse
      events (AEs) were evaluated. Results: One hundred forty-four patients were
      included (A:101; B:43). Patients were 49.3% males, mean age 60 years (SD ± 13.5);
      31.9% cirrhotic; 125 (86.8%) HCV-monoinfected and 19 (13.2%) HCV /HIV-coinfected.
      Twenty patients (13.8%) required a change of psychiatric therapy before
      initiation of DAA. Overall, SVR-12 was achieved in 88.2% of subjects in
      intention-to-treat(ITT)-analysis. Lower SVR rates were observed in group B vs A
      (79% vs 92%, p = 0.045) and in those changing psychiatric drugs vs others (8% vs 
      30%, p = 0.015). According to per-protocol (PP)-analysis, SVR-12 was achieved in 
      93/95 (97.9%) in group A versus 34/36 (94.4%) in group B (p = 0.30). At least one
      AE occurred in 60 patients (41.6%), including 10 severe AEs, leading to 3
      discontinuations. AEs were more frequently reported in group A (p = 0.015).
      Conclusions: The study confirms effectiveness and safety of DAA-based treatment
      also in this special population, even if a careful evaluation of history and
      drug-drug interactions is warranted.

TI  - Daily physical activity and related risk factors in COPD.
LID - 60
AB  - Background: Factors associated with reduced daily physical activity (DPA) in
      patients with COPD are still controversial. Physical inactivity in COPD increases
      risk of cardiovascular disease, frequent exacerbations, reduced health status,
      and increased symptoms. We hypothesised that reduced DPA in patients with COPD is
      independent of traditional risk factors including age and spirometry. Methods: In
      this cross-sectional study, DPA (over 7 days) was assessed on 88 community stable
      patients with COPD and 40 controls free from cardiorespiratory disease.
      Spirometry, body composition, number of exacerbations, handgrip strength (HGS),
      modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), arterial stiffness, 6-min walking
      distance (6MWD) and BODE index were also determined. Frequent exacerbation was
      defined as ≥2 and non-frequent exacerbation < 2. Results: Patients with COPD had 
      reduced DPA and exercise capacity compared with controls similar in age, BMI and 
      gender, p < 0.001. Frequent exacerbators had less DPA than infrequent
      exacerbators and both less than controls, p < 0.001. Patients with higher BODE
      index were less active than those with lower index. Time spent on moderate
      activity was related to cardiovascular risk factors including arterial stiffness.
      The DPA in patients was independent of age, gender, spirometry, body composition 
      and HGS, p > 0.05. The level of breathlessness was superior to lung function in
      predicting the level of DPA. Conclusion: The level of DPA in COPD was independent
      of traditional risk factors. Breathlessness score is a better predictor of the
      DPA than lung function and handgrip strength.

TI  - Homeless Patients Associate Clinician Bias With Suboptimal Care for Mental
      Illness, Addictions, and Chronic Pain.
LID - 2150132720910289
AB  - Objective: To determine how accessible health care services are for people who
      are experiencing homelessness and to understand from their perspectives what
      impact clinician bias has on the treatment they receive. Methods: Narrative
      interviews were conducted with 53 homeless/vulnerably housed individuals in
      Ontario, Canada. Visit history records were subsequently reviewed at 2 local
      hospitals, for 52 of the interview participants. Results: Of the 53 participants 
      only 28% had a primary care provider in town, an additional 40% had a provider in
      another town, and 32% had no access to a primary care provider at all. A subset
      of the individuals were frequent emergency department users, with 15% accounting 
      for 75% of the identified hospital visits, primarily seeking treatment for mental
      illness, pain, and addictions. When seeking primary care for these 3 issues
      participants felt medication was overprescribed. Conversely, in emergency care
      settings participants felt prejudged by clinicians as being drug-seekers.
      Participants believed they received poor quality care or were denied care for
      mental illness, chronic pain, and addictions when clinicians were aware of their 
      housing status. Conclusion: Mental illness, chronic pain, and addictions issues
      were believed by participants to be poorly treated due to clinician bias at the
      primary, emergency, and acute care levels. Increased access to primary care in
      the community could better serve this marginalized population and decrease
      emergency department visits but must be implemented in a way that respects the
      rights and dignity of this patient population.

TI  - Illicit drug use while admitted to hospital: Patient and health care provider
      perspectives.
LID - e0229713
AB  - Background: Across North America, the opioid overdose epidemic is leading to
      increasing hospitalizations of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, hospitals
      are ill-prepared to meet the needs of PWUD. We focus on illicit drug use while
      admitted to hospital and how PWUD and health care providers describe, respond,
      and attempt to manage its use. Methods and findings: Using varied purposive
      methods in Toronto and Ottawa, we recruited n = 24 PWUD (who self-reported that
      they were living with HIV and/or HCV infection; currently or had previously used 
      drugs or alcohol in ways that were harmful; had a hospital admission in the past 
      five years) and n = 26 health care providers (who were: currently working in an
      academic hospital as a physician, nurse, social worker or other allied health
      professional; and 2) providing care to this patient group). All n = 50
      participants completed a short, socio-demographic questionnaire and an
      audio-recorded semi-structured interview about receiving or providing acute care 
      in a hospital between 04/2014 and 05/2015. Patient participants received $25 CAD 
      and return transit fare; provider participants received a $50 CAD gift card for a
      bookseller. All participants provided informed consent. Audio-recordings were
      transcribed verbatim, corrected, and uploaded to NVivo 10. Using the seven-step
      framework method, transcripts were coded line-by-line and managed using NVvivo.
      An analytic framework was created by grouping and mapping the codes. Preliminary 
      analyses were presented to advisory group members for comment and used to refine 
      the interpretation. Questionnaire data were managed using SPSS version 22.0 and
      descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants. Many but not all
      patient participants spoke about using psycho-active substances not prescribed to
      them during a hospital admission. Attempts to avoid negative experiences (e.g.,
      withdrawal, boredom, sadness, loneliness and/or untreated pain) were cited as
      reasons for illicit drug use. Most tried to conceal their illicit drug use from
      health care providers. Patients described how their self-reported level of pain
      was not always believed, tolerance to opioids was ignored, and requests for
      higher doses of pain medications denied. Some health care providers were unaware 
      of on-site illicit drug use; others acknowledged it occurred. Few could identify 
      a hospital policy specific to illicit drug use and most used their personal
      beliefs to guide their responses to it (e.g., ignore it, increase surveillance of
      patients, reprimands, loss of privileges/medications, threats of immediate
      discharge should it continue, and substitution dosing of medication).
      Conclusions: Providers highlighted gaps in institutional guidance for how they
      ought to appropriately respond to in-hospital substance use. Patients attempted
      to conceal illicit drug use in environments with no institutional policies about 
      such use, leading to varied responses that were inconsistent with the principles 
      of patient centred care and reflected personal beliefs about illicit drug use.
      There are increasing calls for implementation of harm reduction approaches and
      interventions in hospitals but uptake has been slow. Our study contributes to
      this emerging body of literature and highlights areas for future research, the
      development of interventions, and changes to policy and practice.

TI  - Efficacy of a Single Intra-Articular HYMOVIS ONE Injection for Managing
      Symptomatic Hip Osteoarthritis: A 12-Month Follow-Up Retrospective Analysis of
      the ANTIAGE Register Data.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - Purpose: The use of ultrasound (US) guidance has allowed hip osteoarthritis to be
      treated with intra-articular (IA) injections. HYMOVIS ONE (HYADD4-G) is a new
      hyaluronic acid (HA) derivative product with unusual characteristics, and it has 
      been used with good results in knee osteoarthritis (OA). This study assessed the 
      efficacy and safety of a single HYMOVIS ONE injection in patients affected by
      symptomatic hip OA. Patients and Methods: This post-marketing cohort study
      assessed data from the ANTIAGE Register. Inclusion criteria were age ≥40 years,
      symptomatic hip OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade I–III) of ≥1-year duration, and ≥12
      months follow-up. All patients received a single HYMOVIS ONE (32 mg/4 mL)
      injection at baseline. Values for 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, 
      the Lequesne index, and nonsteroidal anti–inflammatory drug (NSAID) consumption
      were evaluated at 6 and 12 months. Adverse events were also recorded. Results:
      The included patients (n = 198) consisted of 42.5% women, with a mean (± SD) age 
      at baseline of 62 (± 14.2) years and a mean (± SD) body mass index of 26.3 (±
      2.5). The mean (SD) Lequesne index and VAS pain scores at baseline were 11.5 (±
      4.6) and 6.4 cm (± 2.2), respectively. All groups exhibited statistically
      significant reductions at all time points compared to baseline. At 12 months, the
      VAS pain score was reduced by 17.2%, the Lequesne index by 33.7%, and NSAID
      consumption by 41.7%. Conclusion: Our study supports the clinical efficacy and
      safety of a single HYMOVIS ONE injection for managing symptoms in patients with
      hip OA, confirming previous data on the use of HYMOVIS as a background therapy in
      the management of knee osteoarthritis.

TI  - The Role of Inhaled Anesthetics in Tumorigenesis and Tumor Immunity.
PG  - 1601-9
AB  - Inhaled anesthetics are widely used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia
      during surgery, including isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, haloflurane,
      nitrous oxide (N2O), enflurane and xenon. Nowadays, it is controversial whether
      inhaled anesthetics may influence the tumor progression, which urges us to
      describe the roles of different inhaled anesthetics in human cancers. In the
      review, the relationships among the diverse inhaled anesthetics and patient
      outcomes, immune response and cancer cell biology were discussed. Moreover, the
      mechanisms of various inhaled anesthetics in the promotion or inhibition of
      carcinogenesis were also reviewed. In summary, we concluded that several inhaled 
      anesthetics have different immune functions, clinical outcomes and cancer cell
      biology, which could contribute to opening new avenues for selecting suitable
      inhaled anesthetics in cancer surgery.

      Dysfunction of High-Risk Patients with Femoral Neck Fracture: Evidence from a
      Retrospective Propensity-Matched Study.
PG  - e919708-1-e919708-10
AB  - Background: Elderly patients often suffer from postoperative cognitive impairment
      which increases mortality, morbidity, and the economic burden. However, how
      continuous femoral nerve block (cFNB) influence the incidence of postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction (POCD) has never been reported. This study tried to explore
      how cFNB affects the incidence of POCD among low-risk and high-risk patients with
      femoral neck fractures. Material/Methods: We conducted a retrospective propensity
      score-matched study and allocated matched patients (n=172) with femoral neck
      fractures into the cFNB group (n=86) and the control group (n=86). Demographical 
      and clinical data were collected and compared, including the visual analog scale 
      (VAS) score, the morphine consumption, and the POCD incidence. Subgroup analysis 
      of high-risk patients (Mini-Cog score ≤2) and low-risk patients (Mini-Cog score
      ≥3) was also carried out. Results: After matching, baseline characteristics of 2 
      groups were comparable between the 2 groups (all P>0.05). Compared with the
      control group, the cFNB group had significantly lower visual analog scale (VAS)
      score and morphine consumption in the postoperative 3 days (P<0.05). For
      high-risk patients, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve suggested that the incidence 
      of POCD the cFNB group was significantly lower than the control group (P=0.005), 
      without statistical difference for total or low-risk patients (P>0.05).
      Multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis showed that the adoption of cFNB
      conferred a protective effect on POCD (HR=0.556, 95% CI 0.316–0.981, P=0.043).
      Conclusions: For patients undergoing femoral neck fracture surgery, perioperative
      cFNB administration is useful in decreasing the incidence of POCD, especially for
      high-risk patients with a Mini-Cog score equal to or less than 2 points.

      without congenital malformations aged 0 to 14 years old were recruited from the
      Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College and Nanchong Central
      Hospital between March 2016 and November 2018. This study was designed as a
      case-control study with 1:1 frequency matching, in which the parents of cases and
      controls were interviewed with the same questionnaire according to the
      gestational age of the child, maternal age during pregnancy and the same maternal
      race/ethnicity. Then, 322 matched case-control pairs were analysed by SPSS 22.
      Thirty-one suspicious factors were entered into the binary logistic regression
      analysis after univariate regression analysis of 55 factors (alpha = 0.05). The
      analysis results showed that 7 factors were significantly associated with the
      occurrence of CHD. Thus, augmenting maternal mental healthcare, improving the
      quality of drinking water, obtaining adequate nutrition, maintaining a healthy
      physical condition during pregnancy, enhancing parents’ level of knowledge and
      maintaining a healthy lifestyle may lower the occurrence of CHD.

      USA: Variations in buprenorphine and methadone treatment by geography,
      operational, and payment characteristics, 2007-16.
LID - e0229787
AB  - Objective: To identify the geographic, organisational, and payment correlates of 
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment among substance abuse treatment (SAT)
      providers. Methods: Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Substance Abuse 
      Treatment Services (NSSATS) from 2007–16 were conducted. We provide bivariate
      descriptive statistics regarding substance abuse treatment services which offered
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment from 2007–16. Using multiple logistic
      regression, we regressed geographic, organisational, and payment correlates on
      buprenorphine and methadone treatment. Results: Buprenorphine is increasingly
      offered at SAT facilities though uptake remains comparatively low outside of the 
      northeast. SAT facilities run by tribal governments or Indian Health Service
      which offer buprenorphine remain low compared to privately operated SAT
      facilities (AOR = 0.528). The odds of offering buprenorphine among facilities
      offering free or no charge treatment (AOR = 0.838) or a sliding fee scale (AOR = 
      0.464) was lower. SAT facilities accepting Medicaid payments showed higher odds
      of offering methadone treatment (AOR = 2.035). Conclusions: Greater attention
      towards the disparities in provision of opioid agonist therapies is warranted,
      especially towards the reasons why uptake has been moderate among civilian
      providers. Additionally, the care needs of Native Americans facing opioid-related
      use disorders bears further scrutiny.

TI  - Illness-related suffering and need for palliative care in Rohingya refugees and
      caregivers in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study.
LID - e1003011
AB  - Background: Despite recognition that palliative care is an essential component of
      any humanitarian response, serious illness-related suffering continues to be
      pervasive in these settings. There is very limited evidence about the need for
      palliative care and symptom relief to guide the implementation of programs to
      alleviate the burden of serious illness-related suffering in these settings. A
      basic package of essential medications and supplies can provide pain relief and
      palliative care; however, the practical availability of these items has not been 
      assessed. This study aimed to describe the illness-related suffering and need for
      palliative care in Rohingya refugees and caregivers in Bangladesh. Methods and
      findings: Between November 20 and 24, 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional study 
      of individuals with serious health problems (n = 156, 53% male) and caregivers (n
      = 155, 69% female) living in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, using
      convenience sampling to recruit participants at the community level (i.e., going 
      house to house to identify eligible individuals). The serious health problems,
      recent healthcare experiences, need for medications and medical supplies, and
      basic needs of participants were explored through interviews with trained
      Rohingya community members, using an interview guide that had been piloted with
      Rohingya individuals to ensure it reflected the specificities of their refugee
      experience and culture. The most common diagnoses were significant physical
      disabilities (n = 100, 64.1%), treatment-resistant tuberculosis (TB) (n = 32,
      20.5%), cancer (n = 15, 9.6%), and HIV infection (n = 3, 1.9%). Many individuals 
      with serious health problems were experiencing significant pain (62%, n = 96),
      and pain treatments were largely ineffective (70%, n = 58). The average age was
      44.8 years (range 2–100 years) for those with serious health problems and 34.9
      years (range 8–75 years) for caregivers. Caregivers reported providing an average
      of 13.8 hours of care per day. Sleep difficulties (87.1%, n = 108), lack of
      appetite (58.1%, n = 72), and lack of pleasure in life (53.2%, n = 66) were the
      most commonly reported problems related to the caregiving role. The main
      limitations of this study were the use of convenience sampling and closed-ended
      interview questioning. Conclusions: In this study we found that many individuals 
      with serious health problems experienced significant physical, emotional, and
      social suffering due to a lack of access to pain and symptom relief and other
      essential components of palliative care. Humanitarian responses should develop
      and incorporate palliative care and symptom relief strategies that address the
      needs of all people with serious illness-related suffering and their caregivers.

AB  - The American Board of Family Medicine routinely surveys its Diplomates in each
      national graduating cohort 3 years out of training. These data were used to
      characterize early career family physicians whose services include management of 
      pregnancy and prescribing buprenorphine. A total of 261 (5.1%) respondents both
      provide maternity care and prescribe buprenorphine. Family physicians who care
      for pregnant women and also prescribe buprenorphine represented 50.4% of all
      buprenorphine prescribers. The family physicians in this group were trained in a 
      small number of residency programs, with only 15 programs producing at least 25% 
      of graduates who do this work.

TI  - Applying the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
      framework to determine the predictors of falls and fractures in people with
      osteoarthritis or at high risk of developing osteoarthritis: data from the
      Osteoarthritis Initiative.
LID - 138
AB  - Background: Falls are a major cause of injury and death among older people.
      Evidence suggests that people with osteoarthritis (OA) are at a higher risk of
      falls and fall-related injuries including fractures. While studies demonstrate a 
      link between OA and falls, little is known about the pathways that link falls
      with demographic factors, OA impairments, activity limitations and participation 
      restrictions. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for falls and
      fractures among people with OA or at high risk of developing OA using the
      International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)
      framework. Methods: A longitudinal analysis of data from the Osteoarthritis
      Initiative (OAI) dataset was undertaken. Participants were considered to have OA 
      if they reported they had been diagnosed with knee or hip OA by a medical
      practitioner. Outcomes were self-reported falls and fractures. Potential
      predictors were classified using the ICF framework. Poisson regression models
      were used to determine the risk factors for falls and fractures. Results: Of the 
      4796 participants, 2270 (47%) were diagnosed with knee and/or hip OA. A higher
      proportion of participants with OA reported having had falls (72% vs 63%;
      p < 0.0001) and fractures (17% vs 14%; p = 0.012) than those without OA. Personal
      factors were found to be stronger predictors of falls and fractures compared to
      OA impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions in this
      sample of participants. After adjusting for potential covariates, self-reported
      history of falls was a significant predictor of both increased falls (incidence
      rate ratio [IRR] 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40, 4.60) and fracture risk
      (IRR 1.38; 95% CI 1.13, 1.69). Conclusions: By applying the ICF framework, we
      have shown that personal factors were more likely to predict falls and fractures 
      rather than OA impairments, environmental factors, activity limitations and
      participation restrictions in people with OA or at high risk of developing OA.
      This highlights the importance of questioning patients about their previous falls
      and past medical history, and using this information to focus our assessment and 
      clinical decision-making processes.

TI  - Elevated Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio in Older Adults with Cocaine Use Disorder
      as a Marker of Chronic Inflammation.
PG  - 32-40
AB  - Objective: The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a non-specific,
      easy-to-obtain marker of inflammation associated with morbidity and mortality in 
      systemic, psychiatric, and age-related inflammatory conditions. Given the growing
      trend of substance use disorder (SUD) in older adults, and the relationship
      between inflammation and SUD elevated NLR may serve as a useful inflammatory
      biomarker of the combined burden of aging and SUD. The present study focused on
      cocaine use disorder (CUD) to examine if cocaine adds further inflammatory burden
      among older adults, by comparing NLR values between older adults with CUD and a
      non-cocaine using, aged-matched, nationally representative sample. Methods: The
      dataset included 107 (86% male) participants (aged 50–65 years) with cocaine use 
      disorder. NLR was derived from complete blood count tests by dividing the
      absolute value of peripheral neutrophil concentration by lymphocyte
      concentration. For comparison, we extracted data from age-matched adults without 
      CUD using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Individuals with 
      immunocompromising conditions were excluded (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and
      sexually transmitted infections such as HIV). A doubly-robust inverse
      probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) propensity score method was
      used to estimate group differences on NLR while controlling for potential
      confounding variables (age, gender, race, income, nicotine, marijuana and alcohol
      use). Results: The IPWRA model revealed that the CUD sample had significantly
      elevated NLR in comparison to non-cocaine users, with a moderate effect size (β
      weight = 0.67). Conclusion: Although non-specific, NLR represents a readily
      obtainable inflammatory marker for SUD research. CUD may add further inflammatory
      burden to aging cocaine users.

TI  - Minimal Open Access Ileocolic Resection in Complicated Crohn's Disease of the
      Terminal Ileum.
LID - 6019435
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility to undertake an
      ileocolic resection in complex Crohn's disease using a minimal open abdominal
      access using standard laparoscopic instruments. The incision was carried out over
      the previous McBurney scar, with a mean length of 6 cm. Seventy-two patients with
      complicated Crohn's disease underwent IC resection in the considered period; 12
      patients had a McBurney scar due to a previous appendectomy and represented the
      group of study. Feasibility and safety of the procedure were evaluated. Clinical 
      data and outcome were compared with a control arm of 15 patients who had a
      standard laparoscopic IC resection, pooled out from our database among those who 
      had a McBurney incision as service incision. Mean operative time and
      postoperative stay were significantly shorter in the study group. Blood loss and 
      operative costs were also lower in the study group but did not reach statistical 
      significance. Minimal open access ileocolic resection (MOAIR) through a small
      McBurney incision seems safe and feasible in complex Crohn's disease. Some
      advantages over standard laparoscopic surgery could be found in surgical outcomes
      and costs.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine Improves Cardiovascular and Ventilatory Outcomes in Critically
      Ill Patients: Basic and Clinical Approaches.
LID - 1641
AB  - Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective α2-adrenergic agonist with sedative
      and analgesic properties, with minimal respiratory effects. It is used as a
      sedative in the intensive care unit and the operating room. The opioid-sparing
      effect and the absence of respiratory effects make dexmedetomidine an attractive 
      adjuvant drug for anesthesia in obese patients who are at an increased risk for
      postoperative respiratory complications. The pharmacodynamic effects on the
      cardiovascular system are known; however the mechanisms that induce
      cardioprotection are still under study. Regarding the pharmacokinetics
      properties, this drug is extensively metabolized in the liver by the uridine
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases. It has a relatively high hepatic extraction
      ratio, and therefore, its metabolism is dependent on liver blood flow. This
      review shows, from a basic clinical approach, the evidence supporting the use of 
      dexmedetomidine in different settings, from its use in animal models of
      ischemia-reperfusion, and cardioprotective signaling pathways. In addition,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies in obese subjects and the
      management of patients subjected to mechanical ventilation are described.
      Moreover, the clinical efficacy of delirium incidence in patients with indication
      of non-invasive ventilation is shown. Finally, the available evidence from DEX is
      described by a group of Chilean pharmacologists and clinicians who have worked
      for more than 10 years on DEX.

TI  - Physical and Pharmacological Restraints in Hospital Care: Protocol for a
      Systematic Review.
LID - 921
AB  - Background: Physical and pharmacological restraints, defined as all measures
      limiting a person in his or her freedom, are extensively used to handle unsafe or
      problematic behavior in hospital care. There are increasing concerns as to the
      extent with which these restraints are being used in hospitals, and whether their
      benefits outweigh their potential harm. There is currently no comprehensive
      literature overview on the beneficial and/or adverse effects of the use of
      physical and pharmacological restraints in the hospital setting. Methods: A
      systematic review of the existing literature will be performed on the beneficial 
      and/or adverse effects of physical and pharmacological restraints in the hospital
      setting. Relevant databases will be systematically searched. A dedicated search
      strategy was composed. A visualization of similarities (VOS) analysis was used to
      further specify the search. Observational studies, and if available, randomized
      controlled trials reporting on beneficial and/or adverse effects of physical
      and/or pharmacological restraints in the general hospital setting will be
      included. Data from included articles will be extracted and analyzed. If the data
      is suitable for quantitative analysis, meta-analysis will be applied. Discussion:
      This review will provide data on the beneficial and/or adverse effects of the use
      of physical and pharmacological restraints in hospital care. With this review we 
      aim to guide health professionals by providing a critique of the available
      evidence regarding their choice to either apply or withhold from using
      restraints. A limitation of the current review will be that we will not
      specifically address ethical aspects of restraint use. Nevertheless, the outcomes
      of our systematic review can be used in the composition of a multidisciplinary
      guideline. Furthermore, our systematic review might determine knowledge gaps in
      the evidence, and recommendations on how to target these gaps with future
      research. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO registration number:
      CRD42019116186.

TI  - An adaptable implementation package targeting evidence-based indicators in
      primary care: A pragmatic cluster-randomised evaluation.
LID - e1003045
AB  - Background: In primary care, multiple priorities and system pressures make
      closing the gap between evidence and practice challenging. Most implementation
      studies focus on single conditions, limiting generalisability. We compared an
      adaptable implementation package against an implementation control and assessed
      effects on adherence to four different evidence-based quality indicators. Methods
      and findings: We undertook two parallel, pragmatic cluster-randomised trials
      using balanced incomplete block designs in general practices in West Yorkshire,
      England. We used ‘opt-out’ recruitment, and we randomly assigned practices that
      did not opt out to an implementation package targeting either diabetes control or
      risky prescribing (Trial 1); or blood pressure (BP) control or anticoagulation in
      atrial fibrillation (AF) (Trial 2). Within trials, each arm acted as the
      implementation control comparison for the other targeted indicator. For example, 
      practices assigned to the diabetes control package acted as the comparison for
      practices assigned to the risky prescribing package. The implementation package
      embedded behaviour change techniques within audit and feedback, educational
      outreach, and computerised support, with content tailored to each indicator.
      Respective patient-level primary endpoints at 11 months comprised the following: 
      achievement of all recommended levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BP, and
      cholesterol; risky prescribing levels; achievement of recommended BP; and
      anticoagulation prescribing. Between February and March 2015, we recruited 144
      general practices collectively serving over 1 million patients. We stratified
      computer-generated randomisation by area, list size, and pre-intervention outcome
      achievement. In April 2015, we randomised 80 practices to Trial 1 (40 per arm)
      and 64 to Trial 2 (32 per arm). Practices and trial personnel were not blind to
      allocation. Two practices were lost to follow-up but provided some outcome data. 
      We analysed the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, adjusted for potential
      confounders at patient level (sex, age) and practice level (list size, locality, 
      pre-intervention achievement against primary outcomes, total quality scores, and 
      levels of patient co-morbidity), and analysed cost-effectiveness. The
      implementation package reduced risky prescribing (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 97.5%
      confidence interval [CI] 0.67–0.99, p = 0.017) with an incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio of £1,359 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but
      there was insufficient evidence of effect on other primary endpoints (diabetes
      control OR 1.03, 97.5% CI 0.89–1.18, p = 0.693; BP control OR 1.05, 97.5% CI
      0.96–1.16, p = 0.215; anticoagulation prescribing OR 0.90, 97.5% CI 0.75–1.09, p 
      = 0.214). No statistically significant effects were observed in any secondary
      outcome except for reduced co-prescription of aspirin and clopidogrel without
      gastro-protection in patients aged 65 and over (adjusted OR 0.62; 97.5% CI
      0.39–0.99; p = 0.021). Main study limitations concern our inability to make any
      inferences about the relative effects of individual intervention components,
      given the multifaceted nature of the implementation package, and that the
      composite endpoint for diabetes control may have been too challenging to achieve.
      Conclusions: In this study, we observed that a multifaceted implementation
      package was clinically and cost-effective for targeting prescribing behaviours
      within the control of clinicians but not for more complex behaviours that also
      required patient engagement. Trial registration: The study is registered with the
      ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN91989345).

TI  - The analgesic efficacy compared ultrasound-guided continuous transverse abdominis
      plane block with epidural analgesia following abdominal surgery: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 52
AB  - Background: This review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the analgesic efficacy
      of continuous transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block compared with epidural
      analgesia (EA) in adults after abdominal surgery. Methods: The databases PubMed, 
      Embase and Cochrane Central Register were searched from inception to June 2019
      for all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the
      analgesic efficacy of continuous TAP block compared with EA after abdominal
      surgery. The weighted mean differences (WMDs) were estimates for continuous
      variables with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous
      data. The pre-specified primary outcome was the dynamic pain scores 24 h
      postoperatively. Results: Eight trials including 453 patients (TAP block:224
      patients; EA: 229 patients) ultimately met the inclusion criteria and seven
      trials were included in the meta-analysis. Dynamic pain scores after 24 h were
      equivalent between TAP block and EA groups (WMD:0.44; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.99;
      I2 = 91%; p = 0.11). The analysis showed a significant difference between the
      subgroups according to regularly administering (4 trials; WMD:-0.11; 95% CI:
      − 0.32 to 0.09; I2 = 0%; p = 0.28) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      or not (3 trials; WMD:1.02; 95% CI: 0.09 to 1.96; I2 = 94%; p = 0.03) for
      adjuvant analgesics postoperatively. The measured time of the urinary catheter
      removal in the TAP group was significantly shorter (3 trials, WMD:-18.95, 95%
      CI:-25.22 to − 12.71; I2 = 0%; p < 0.01), as was time to first ambulation
      postoperatively (4 trials, WMD:-6.61, 95% CI: − 13.03 to − 0.19; I2 = 67%;
      p < 0.05). Conclusion: Continuous TAP block, combined with NSAIDs, can provide
      non-inferior dynamic analgesia efficacy compared with EA in postoperative pain
      management after abdominal surgery. In addition, continuous TAP block is
      associated with fewer postoperative side effects.

TI  - Hepatic Autonomic Nervous System and Neurotrophic Factors Regulate the
      Pathogenesis and Progression of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.
LID - 62
AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a continuum of excessive hepatic
      steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. It is a growing epidemic in the United
      States of America and worldwide. Progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      can lead to morbidity and mortality due to complications such as cirrhosis or
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is
      centered on increased hepatic lipogenesis and decreased hepatic lipolysis in the 
      setting of hepatic and systemic insulin resistance. Adipose tissue and hepatic
      inflammation can further perpetuate the severity of illness. Currently there are 
      no approved therapies for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Most of the drugs
      being explored for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease focus on classical
      pathogenic pathways surrounding hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation or
      fibrosis. Studies have demonstrated that the autonomic nervous system innervating
      the liver plays a crucial role in regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis,
      inflammation and fibrosis. Additionally, there is growing evidence that
      neurotrophic factors can modulate all stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease. Both the autonomic nervous system and neurotrophic factors are altered
      in patients and murine models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In this
      review we focus on the pathophysiological role of the autonomic nervous system
      and neurotrophic factors that could be potential targets for novel therapeutic
      approaches to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

TI  - Lornoxicam controlled release transdermal gel patch: Design, characterization and
      optimization using co-solvents as penetration enhancers.
LID - e0228908
AB  - The aim of the current study was to develop membrane-based transdermal patches of
      lornoxicam gel using oleic acid (OA)and propylene glycol (PG) as penetration
      enhancers to improve drug delivery across the skin and to evaluate in vivo
      analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. For this purpose, nine formulations
      were developed in accordance with 32 factorial design using Design Expert® 11.
      The concentration of propylene glycol (X1) and oleic acid (X2) were selected as
      independent variable whereas Q10 (Y1), flux (Y2) and lag time (Y3) were
      considered as the response variables. The impact of drug loading, surface area,
      gel concentration, membrane variation and agitation speed on drug release and
      permeation was also studied. The skin sensitivity reaction, analgesic activity
      and anti-inflammatory action of the optimized patch were also determined in
      Albino Wistar rats. Stability studies were performed for three months at three
      different temperature conditions. The result suggests that a membrane-based
      system with controlled zero-order drug release of 95.8 ± 1.121% for 10 h
      exhibiting flux of 126.51±1.19 μg/cm2/h and lag time of 0.908 ±0.57h was
      optimized with the desired analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect can be obtained
      by using propylene glycol and oleic acid co-solvents as a penetration enhancer.
      The patch was also found stable at 4˚C for a period of 6.44 months. Formulation
      F9 comprising of 10% PG and 3% OA was selected as an optimized formulation. The
      study demonstrates that the fabricated transdermal system of lornoxicam can
      deliver the drug through the skin in a controlled manner with desired analgesic
      and anti-inflammatory activity and can be considered as a suitable alternative of
      the oral route.

TI  - When will pulmonary function recover after rib fracture?
PG  - 108-11
AB  - Rib fracture is almost recovered with conservative management including oral
      medication. Pain is easily controlled with medication, but physiologic function
      is not readily evaluated. This study is aimed to investigate the factors
      influencing to recovery of pulmonary function test (PFT) and changes according to
      times after rib fracture. From August 2015 to January 2018, medical records of
      patients with rib fracture were reviewed retrospectively. Factors may influencing
      to recovery of PFT (age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, numbers of
      fractures, intercostal nerve block) were evaluated, and serial (initial, 1 month,
      2 months) changes of parameters PFT (forced vital capacity [FVC], forced
      expiratory volume in 1 sec [FEV1], total lung capacity [TLC], vital capacity
      [VC]) for 2 months were observed. Total patients were 60, and PFT was completed
      38 and 27 patients after 1 month and 2 months respectively. Mean age was 55.1
      years (20–84 years) and mean numbers of fracture were 3.98 (1–11). Intercostal
      nerve block and rib fixation were performed in 32 cases and 2 cases respectively.
      Age, numbers of fracture and intercostal nerve block were not significant factors
      to changes of PFT. But chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was significant
      factor to recovery of FEV1 in 1 month. PFT was improved in FVC, FEV1 through 2
      months, and improved in TLC, VC in 1 month. This study showed the evidence and
      prognosis of physiologic recovery after rib fracture. And we could tell about
      physiologic recovery to rib fracture patients with this study.

TI  - In inpatients with cirrhosis opioid use is common and associated with length of
      stay and persistent use post-discharge.
LID - e0229497
AB  - Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that opioids are often prescribed 
      and associated with complications in outpatients with cirrhosis. Less is known
      about opioids among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. We aimed to describe
      the patterns and complications of opioid use among inpatients with cirrhosis.
      Methods: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with cirrhosis
      admitted to a single hospital system from 4/4/2014 to 9/30/2015. We excluded
      hospitalizations with a surgery, invasive procedure, or palliative care/hospice
      consult in order to understand opioid use that may be avoidable. We determined
      the frequency, dosage, and type of opioids given during hospitalization. Using
      bivariable and multivariable analyses, we assessed length of stay, intensive care
      unit transfer, and in-hospital mortality by opioid use. Results: Of 217
      inpatients with cirrhosis, 118 (54.4%) received opioids during hospitalization,
      including 41.7% of patients without prior outpatient opioid prescriptions.
      Benzodiazepines or hypnotic sleep aids were given to 28.8% of opioid recipients. 
      In the multivariable model, younger age and outpatient opioid prescription were
      associated with inpatient opioids. Hospitalization was longer among opioid
      recipients (median 3.9 vs 3.0 days, p = 0.002) and this difference remained after
      adjusting for age, cirrhosis severity, and medical comorbidities. There was no
      difference in intensive care unit transfers and no deaths occurred. At discharge,
      22 patients were newly started on opioids of whom 10 (45.5%) had opioid
      prescriptions at 90 days post-discharge. Conclusion: In non-surgical inpatients
      with cirrhosis, opioid prescribing was common and associated with prolonged
      length of stay. A high proportion of patients newly discharged with opioid
      prescriptions had ongoing prescriptions at 90 days post-discharge.

TI  - A215 PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE ARE FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED OPIOID
      ANALGESICS WHEN DISCHARGED FROM THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.
PG  - 88-9
AB  - Background: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suffer a substantial
      burden of morbidity related to chronic abdominal pain and are susceptible to
      opioid dependence and abuse that is associated with increased rates of
      depression, hospitalization, and mortality. While opioid prescription and renewal
      by a single provider minimizes the long-term risk of misuse, many patients with
      IBD will seek out care in the emergency department (ED) where short-term, ‘to-go’
      use of narcotic analgesia is associated with potential treatment-related
      complications. Aims: To assess rates of opioid prescription in IBD patients
      presenting to the ED and to assess factors associated with opioid use. Methods:
      This is a retrospective analysis of cross-sectional data collected in the United 
      States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2006–2015. 
      We compared a study population of adult IBD patients (International
      Classification of Diseases ICD-9 555.X, 556.X) ≥18 years discharged from the ED
      to a control group of patients presenting with non-specific abdominal pain (ICD-9
      789.0, 564.1, 536.8). The proportion of patients given opioids in ED and at ED
      discharge were calculated with relative standard error (RSE), and national level 
      estimates were produced using survey weights. Univariable and multivariable
      logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of opioid prescription at
      discharge, expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
      Results: A total of 767,577 IBD patients were compared to 71,359,257 patients
      with non-specific abdominal pain. A total of 37.3% (RSE 4.7%) of IBD patients
      compared to 24.7% (RSE 0.8%) of controls (p<0.01) received an opioid prescription
      on ED discharge. 49.1% (RSE 5.6%) of IBD patients compared to 37.2% (RSE 0.8%) of
      patients with non-specific abdominal pain (p=0.02) received an opioid while in
      ED. Significant predictors of narcotic prescription at discharge in multivariable
      analysis included: age <50 (OR 6.83 [95% CI: 1.21, 38.48], p=0.03), non-white
      race (OR 4.73 [95% CI: 1.46, 15.39], p=0.01), and narcotic use in the ED (OR 5.27
      [95% CI: 1.96, 14.21], p<0.01). Conclusions: Nearly 40% of IBD patients were
      prescribed an opioid at discharge from the ED. This rate is significantly higher 
      than for patients who present with non-specific abdominal pain and younger,
      non-white IBD patients were disproportionately more likely to receive an opioid
      prescription. Given the risks associated with on-demand narcotic use in IBD
      patients, our data highlight a potential gap in care for accessing comprehensive 
      pain management solutions.Table 1.Survey weighted baseline demographic

TI  - Mapping the Steroid Response to Major Trauma From Injury to Recovery: A
      Prospective Cohort Study.
LID - dgz302
AB  - Context: Survival rates after severe injury are improving, but complication rates
      and outcomes are variable. Objective: This cohort study addressed the lack of
      longitudinal data on the steroid response to major trauma and during recovery.
      Design: We undertook a prospective, observational cohort study from time of
      injury to 6 months postinjury at a major UK trauma centre and a military
      rehabilitation unit, studying patients within 24 hours of major trauma (estimated
      New Injury Severity Score (NISS) > 15). Main outcome measures: We measured
      adrenal and gonadal steroids in serum and 24-hour urine by mass spectrometry,
      assessed muscle loss by ultrasound and nitrogen excretion, and recorded clinical 
      outcomes (ventilator days, length of hospital stay, opioid use, incidence of
      organ dysfunction, and sepsis); results were analyzed by generalized mixed-effect
      linear models. Findings: We screened 996 multiple injured adults, approached 106,
      and recruited 95 eligible patients; 87 survived. We analyzed all male survivors
      <50 years not treated with steroids (N = 60; median age 27 [interquartile range
      24–31] years; median NISS 34 [29–44]). Urinary nitrogen excretion and muscle loss
      peaked after 1 and 6 weeks, respectively. Serum testosterone,
      dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate decreased immediately 
      after trauma and took 2, 4, and more than 6 months, respectively, to recover;
      opioid treatment delayed dehydroepiandrosterone recovery in a dose-dependent
      fashion. Androgens and precursors correlated with SOFA score and probability of
      sepsis. Conclusion: The catabolic response to severe injury was accompanied by
      acute and sustained androgen suppression. Whether androgen supplementation
      improves health outcomes after major trauma requires further investigation.

TI  - Dexmedetomidine Pharmacokinetics in Neonates with Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy
      Receiving Hypothermia.
LID - 2582965
AB  - Dexmedetomidine is a promising sedative and analgesic for newborns with
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH).
      Pharmacokinetics and safety of dexmedetomidine were evaluated in a phase I,
      single-center, open-label study to inform future trial strategies. We recruited 7
      neonates ≥36 weeks' gestational age diagnosed with moderate-to-severe HIE, who
      received a continuous dexmedetomidine infusion during TH and the 6 h rewarming
      period. Time course of plasma dexmedetomidine concentration was characterized by 
      serial blood sampling during and after the 64.8 ± 6.9 hours of infusion.
      Noncompartmental analysis yielded descriptive pharmacokinetic estimates: plasma
      clearance of 0.760 ± 0.155 L/h/kg, steady-state distribution volume of
      5.22 ± 2.62 L/kg, and mean residence time of 6.84 ± 3.20 h. Naive pooled and
      population analyses according to a one-compartment model provided similar
      estimates of clearance and distribution volume. Overall, clearance was either
      comparable or lower, distribution volume was larger, and mean residence time or
      elimination half-life was longer in cooled newborns with HIE compared to
      corresponding estimates previously reported for uncooled (normothermic) newborns 
      without HIE at comparable gestational and postmenstrual ages. As a result, plasma
      concentrations in cooled newborns with HIE rose more slowly in the initial hours 
      of infusion compared to predicted concentration-time profiles based on reported
      pharmacokinetic parameters in normothermic newborns without HIE, while similar
      steady-state levels were achieved. No acute adverse events were associated with
      dexmedetomidine treatment. While dexmedetomidine appeared safe for neonates with 
      HIE during TH at infusion doses up to 0.4 μg/kg/h, a loading dose strategy may be
      needed to overcome the initial lag in rise of plasma dexmedetomidine
      concentration.

TI  - Identification and Management of Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity After
      Traumatic Brain Injury.
LID - 81
AB  - Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) has predominantly been described after
      traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is associated with hyperthermia,
      hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, dystonia (hypertonia or
      spasticity), and even motor features such as extensor/flexion posturing. Despite 
      the pathophysiology of PSH not being completely understood, most researchers
      gradually agree that PSH is driven by the loss of the inhibition of excitation in
      the sympathetic nervous system without parasympathetic involvement. Recently,
      advances in the clinical and diagnostic features of PSH in TBI patients have
      reached a broad clinical consensus in many neurology departments. These advances 
      should provide a more unanimous foundation for the systematic research on this
      clinical syndrome and its clear management. Clinically, a great deal of attention
      has been paid to the definition and diagnostic criteria, epidemiology and
      pathophysiology, symptomatic treatment, and prevention and control of secondary
      brain injury of PSH in TBI patients. Potential benefits of treatment for PSH may 
      result from the three main goals: eliminating predisposing causes, mitigating
      excessive sympathetic outflow, and supportive therapy. However, individual
      pathophysiological differences, therapeutic responses and outcomes, and precision
      medicine approaches to PSH management are varied and inconsistent between
      studies. Further, many potential therapeutic drugs might suppress manifestations 
      of PSH in the process of TBI treatment. The purpose of this review is to present 
      current and comprehensive studies of the identification of PSH after TBI in the
      early stage and provide a framework for symptomatic management of TBI patients
      with PSH.

TI  - Peripheral Opioid Receptor Antagonists for Opioid-Induced Constipation: A Primer 
      on Pharmacokinetic Variabilities with a Focus on Drug Interactions.
PG  - 447-56
AB  - Opioid analgesics remain a treatment option for refractory acute and chronic
      pain, despite their potential risk for abuse and adverse events (AEs). Opioids
      are associated with several common AEs, but the most bothersome is opioid-induced
      constipation (OIC). OIC is often overlooked but has the potential to affect
      patient quality of life, increase associated symptom burden, and impede long-term
      opioid compliance. The peripherally acting µ-receptor antagonists (PAMORAs) are a
      class of drugs that include methylnaltrexone, naloxegol, and naldemedine.
      Collectively, each is approved for the treatment of OIC. PAMORAs work
      peripherally in the gastrointestinal tract, without impacting the central
      analgesic effects of opioids. However, each has unique pharmacokinetic properties
      that may be impacted by coadministered drugs or food. This review focuses on
      important metabolic and pharmacokinetic principals that are pertinent to drug
      interactions involving µ-opioid receptor antagonists prescribed for OIC. It
      highlights subtle differences among the PAMORAs that may have clinical
      significance. For example, unlike naloxegol or naldemedine, methylnaltrexone is
      not a substrate for CYP3A4 or p-glycoprotein; therefore, its plasma concentration
      is not altered when coadministered with concomitant medications that are CYP3A4
      or p-glycoprotein inducers or inhibitors. With a better understanding of
      pharmacokinetic nuances of each PAMORA, clinicians will be better equipped to
      identify potential safety and efficacy considerations that may arise when PAMORAs
      are coadministered with other medications.

TI  - Music Use for Sedation in Critically ill Children (MUSiCC trial): study protocol 
      for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
LID - 31
AB  - Background: Stress induced by pain and anxiety is common in pediatric intensive
      care unit (PICU) patients. Sedation/analgesia in PICU is usually achieved through
      various analgesics and sedatives. Excessive use of these drugs can put patients
      at risk for hemodynamic/respiratory instability, prolonged ventilation,
      withdrawal, delirium, and critical illness polyneuromyopathy.The use of
      non-pharmacologic interventions has been recommended by sedation guidelines.
      However, non-pharmacological measures in PICU, including music and noise
      reduction, have been inadequately studied. Methods: The Music Use for Sedation in
      Critically ill Children (MUSiCC trial) pilot study is an investigator-initiated, 
      three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the use of music for sedation in 
      PICU. The main goal of the study is to demonstrate feasibility of a music trial
      in PICU and to obtain the necessary information to plan a larger trial. The study
      compares music versus noise cancelation versus control in sedated and
      mechanically ventilated children admitted to PICU. In the music group, children
      receive the music (modified classical music) three times a day for 30 min at a
      time. Music is delivered with noise cancelation headphones. The noise cancelation
      group receives the same intervention but with a no music (sham playlist). The
      control group receives usual care with no specific intervention. Children remain 
      in the study until extubation or a maximum of 7 days. The primary outcomes of the
      study are feasibility and sedation/analgesia requirements. Secondary outcomes
      include change in vital signs before and during the intervention, ICU delirium,
      and adverse effects related to the intervention. The estimated sample size is 20 
      subjects per group for a total of 60 children. Discussion: Despite being
      recommended by current guidelines, evidence to support the use of music in PICU
      is lacking. Music has the potential to reduce sedation requirements and their
      negative side effects. This pilot RCT will demonstrate feasibility and provide
      the necessary information to plan a larger trial focusing on the effectiveness of
      the intervention. Trial registration: The study was registered at
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03497559) on April 13, 2018.

TI  - Effects of synbiotic supplementation on energy and macronutrients homeostasis and
      muscle wasting of critical care patients: study protocol and a review of previous
      studies.
LID - 221
AB  - Background: An extreme and persistent dysbiosis occurs among critically ill
      patients, regardless of the heterogeneity of disease. Dysbiosis in critically ill
      patients may make them prone to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, multi-organ
      failure (MOF), energy homeostasis disturbance, muscle wasting, and cachexia.
      Modulation of gut microbiota through synbiotics can be considered as a potential 
      treatment for muscle wasting and macronutrient homeostasis disturbances. Methods:
      This is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, parallel randomized
      controlled trial with the aim to evaluate the effects of synbiotic
      supplementation on energy and macronutrient homeostasis and muscle wasting in
      critically ill patients. A total of 40 hemodynamically stable, adult, critically 
      ill patients who receive enteral nutrition via a nasogasteric tube (NGT) in the
      24–48 h after admission to critical care will be included in this study. Eligible
      patients will be randomly assigned to receive Lactocare (ZistTakhmir) capsules
      500 mg every 12 h or a placebo capsule, which contains only the sterile maize
      starch and is similar to synbiotic capsules for 14 days. The synbiotic and
      placebo capsules will be given through the nasogastric tube, separately from
      gavage, after feeding. Discussion: Gut microbiota modulation through synbiotics
      is proposed to improve clinical prognosis and reduce infectious complications,
      ventilator dependency, and length of ICU stay by improving energy and
      macronutrient homeostasis and reducing muscle protein catabolism. Trial

TI  - Neuromonitoring of delirium with quantitative pupillometry in sedated
      mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.
LID - 66
AB  - Background: Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium is a frequent secondary
      neurological complication in critically ill patients undergoing prolonged
      mechanical ventilation. Quantitative pupillometry is an emerging modality for the
      neuromonitoring of primary acute brain injury, but its potential utility in
      patients at risk of ICU delirium is unknown. Methods: This was an observational
      cohort study of medical-surgical ICU patients, without acute or known primary
      brain injury, who underwent sedation and mechanical ventilation for at least
      48 h. Starting at day 3, automated infrared pupillometry—blinded to ICU
      caregivers—was used for repeated measurement of the pupillary function, including
      quantitative pupillary light reflex (q-PLR, expressed as % pupil constriction to 
      a standardized light stimulus) and constriction velocity (CV, mm/s). The
      relationship between delirium, using the CAM-ICU score, and quantitative
      pupillary variables was examined. Results: A total of 59/100 patients had ICU
      delirium, diagnosed at a median 8 (5–13) days from admission. Compared to
      non-delirious patients, subjects with ICU delirium had lower values of q-PLR (25 
      [19–31] vs. 20 [15–28] %) and CV (2.5 [1.7–2.8] vs. 1.7 [1.4–2.4] mm/s) at day 3,
      and at all additional time-points tested (p < 0.05). After adjusting for the SOFA
      score and the cumulative dose of analgesia and sedation, lower q-PLR was
      associated with an increased risk of ICU delirium (OR 1.057 [1.007–1.113] at day 
      3; p = 0.03). Conclusions: Sustained abnormalities of quantitative pupillary
      variables at the early ICU phase correlate with delirium and precede clinical
      diagnosis by a median 5 days. These findings suggest a potential utility of
      quantitative pupillometry in sedated mechanically ventilated ICU patients at high
      risk of delirium.

TI  - Consistency between anticholinergic burden scales in the elderly with fractures.
LID - e0228532
AB  - Objective: Falls and bone fractures are important causes of morbidity and
      mortality in the elderly. The objective of this study was to identify the degree 
      of consistency between the anticholinergic scales used for patients diagnosed
      with fractures. Methods: This was an analytical agreement study conducted in
      patients diagnosed with vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in Colombia. The
      quadratic-weighted kappa coefficient was used to identify the consistency between
      the Anticholinergic Drug Scale-ADS, Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale-ACB
      and Anticholinergic Risk Scale-ARS in assessing the prescriptions of fracture
      patients during the month prior to the fracture, during their stay as an
      inpatient and at discharge, according to Landis criteria. Results: 220 patients
      with fractures were included, with a mean age of 75.3±10.3 years, and 68.2% were 
      women. The ACB scale identified the highest anticholinergic burden (26.8%) in
      prescriptions made the month before the fracture, and the highest agreement was
      between ACB and ADS (0.717); during hospitalization and at discharge, the
      cholinergic antagonists were best identified with ADS (77.7% and 72.1%,
      respectively), with the best agreement between ACB and ARS (0.613 and 0.568,
      respectively). The prescription of tramadol was found in 64.1% of hospitalized
      patients and in 61.4% of patients at the time of discharge. Conclusions: The
      scales evaluated show marked discrepancies between them, with highly variable
      frequencies of anticholinergic drugs identified at the different prescription
      times, and with low agreement among them, which is why the scales are not
      interchangeable in patients with bone fractures.

TI  - Paravertebral catheter versus EPidural analgesia in Minimally invasive Esophageal
      resectioN: a randomized controlled multicenter trial (PEPMEN trial).
LID - 142
AB  - Background: Thoracic epidural analgesia is the standard postoperative pain
      management strategy in esophageal cancer surgery. However, paravertebral block
      analgesia may achieve comparable pain control while inducing less side effects,
      which may be beneficial for postoperative recovery. This study primarily aims to 
      compare the postoperative quality of recovery between paravertebral catheter
      versus thoracic epidural analgesia in patients undergoing minimally invasive
      esophagectomy. Methods: This study represents a randomized controlled superiority
      trial. A total of 192 patients will be randomized in 4 Dutch high-volume centers 
      for esophageal cancer surgery. Patients are eligible for inclusion if they are at
      least 18 years old, able to provide written informed consent and complete
      questionnaires in Dutch, scheduled to undergo minimally invasive esophagectomy
      with two-field lymphadenectomy and an intrathoracic anastomosis, and have no
      contra-indications to either epidural or paravertebral analgesia. The primary
      outcome is the quality of postoperative recovery, as measured by the Quality of
      Recovery-40 (QoR-40) questionnaire on the morning of postoperative day 3.
      Secondary outcomes include the QoR-40 questionnaire score Area Under the Curve on
      postoperative days 1–3, the integrated pain and systemic opioid score and patient
      satisfaction and pain experience according to the International Pain Outcomes
      (IPO) questionnaire, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, the groups will be
      compared regarding the need for additional rescue medication on postoperative
      days 0–3, technical failure of the pain treatment, duration of anesthesia,
      duration of surgery, total postoperative fluid administration day 0–3,
      postoperative vasopressor and inotrope use, length of urinary catheter use,
      length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, chronic pain at six months 
      after surgery, and other adverse effects. Discussion: In this study, it is
      hypothesized that paravertebral analgesia achieves comparable pain control while 
      causing less side-effects such as hypotension when compared to epidural
      analgesia, leading to shorter postoperative length of stay on a monitored ward
      and superior quality of recovery. If this hypothesis is confirmed, the results of
      this study can be used to update the relevant guidelines on postoperative pain
      management for patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy. Trial

TI  - Randomized trial comparing low-pressure versus standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum
      in laparoscopic colectomy: PAROS trial.
LID - 216
AB  - Background: Laparoscopy, by its minimally invasive nature, has revolutionized
      digestive and particularly colorectal surgery by decreasing post-operative pain, 
      morbidity, and length of hospital stay. In this trial, we aim to assess whether
      low pressure in laparoscopic colonic surgery (7 mm Hg instead of 12 mm Hg) could 
      further reduce pain, analgesic consumption, and morbidity, resulting in a shorter
      hospital stay. Methods and analysis: The PAROS trial is a phase III,
      double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We aim to recruit 138 patients
      undergoing laparoscopic colectomy. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      either a low-pressure group (7 mm Hg) or a standard-pressure group (12 mm Hg).
      The primary outcome will be a comparison of length of hospital stay between the
      two groups. Secondary outcomes will compare post-operative pain, consumption of
      analgesics, morbidity within 30 days, technical and oncological quality of the
      surgical procedure, time to passage of flatus and stool, and ambulation. All
      adverse events will be recorded. Analysis will be performed on an
      intention-to-treat basis. Trial registration: This research received the approval
      from the Committee for the Protection of Persons and was the subject of
      information to the ANSM. This search is saved in the ID-RCB database under
      registration number 2018-A03028–47. This research is retrospectively registered
      January 23, 2019, at http://clinicaltrials.gov/ed under the name “LaPAroscopic
      Low pRessure cOlorectal Surgery (PAROS)”. This trial is ongoing.

TI  - Breast Cancer Care in Jordan.
LID - JGO.19.00279
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in Jordan and the third leading cause
      of cancer death after lung and colorectal cancers. Although the incidence of
      breast cancer in Jordan is lower than that in industrialized nations, the number 
      of new cases has been significantly increasing, and women present with breast
      cancer at a younger age and with more advanced disease than women in Western
      countries. Jordan is a medium-income country with limited resources and a young
      population structure. Therefore, breast cancer poses a particularly challenging
      burden on the country’s health care system. Despite ongoing endeavors to improve 
      breast cancer care at both public and private levels, more work is needed to
      achieve downstaging of the disease and improve access, awareness, and
      participation in early detection. Multimodality treatment facilities and
      supportive care are available; however, the quality of care varies widely
      according to where the patient is treated, and most treatment facilities remain
      located centrally, thus, creating access difficulties. The King Hussein Cancer
      Center, the only comprehensive cancer center in Jordan, has changed the practice 
      of oncology in the country via implementation of a multidisciplinary approach to 
      treatment, monitoring of treatment outcomes, and investments in ongoing cancer
      research. However, there remains no national system for ensuring provision of
      high-quality cancer care nationwide. Here, we review the epidemiology of breast
      cancer and the current status of breast cancer care in Jordan, we compare our
      treatment outcomes with international ones, and we highlight challenges and
      improvement opportunities.

TI  - Cytotoxic Immunity in Peripheral Nerve Injury and Pain.
LID - 142
AB  - Cytotoxicity and consequent cell death pathways are a critical component of the
      immune response to infection, disease or injury. While numerous examples of
      inflammation causing neuronal sensitization and pain have been described, there
      is a growing appreciation of the role of cytotoxic immunity in response to
      painful nerve injury. In this review we highlight the functions of cytotoxic
      immune effector cells, focusing in particular on natural killer (NK) cells, and
      describe the consequent action of these cells in the injured nerve as well as
      other chronic pain conditions and peripheral neuropathies. We describe how
      targeted delivery of cytotoxic factors via the immune synapse operates alongside 
      Wallerian degeneration to allow local axon degeneration in the absence of cell
      death and is well-placed to support the restoration of homeostasis within the
      nerve. We also summarize the evidence for the expression of endogenous ligands
      and receptors on injured nerve targets and infiltrating immune cells that
      facilitate direct neuro-immune interactions, as well as modulation of the
      surrounding immune milieu. A number of chronic pain and peripheral neuropathies
      appear comorbid with a loss of function of cellular cytotoxicity suggesting such 
      mechanisms may actually help to resolve neuropathic pain. Thus while the immune
      response to peripheral nerve injury is a major driver of maladaptive pain, it is 
      simultaneously capable of directing resolution of injury in part through the
      pathways of cellular cytotoxicity. Our growing knowledge in tuning immune
      function away from inflammation toward recovery from nerve injury therefore holds
      promise for interventions aimed at preventing the transition from acute to
      chronic pain.

TI  - Mechanisms Linking Olfactory Impairment and Risk of Mortality.
LID - 140
AB  - Olfaction is a sense involved in a complex set of tasks, influencing eating
      behavior, increasing awareness of environmental hazards and affecting social
      communication. Surprisingly, smell disorders are very frequent, especially in the
      elderly population. Several recent studies conducted mostly in older subjects
      have demonstrated a strong association between olfactory impairment and overall
      mortality risk, with anosmia being even more predictive of 5 years mortality risk
      than cardiovascular disease. Presently, the underlying pathophysiology linking
      olfactory impairment to mortality remains unknown and only putative mechanisms
      are suggested. This review aims to examine the link between olfactory impairment 
      and mortality and to discuss existing ideas on underlying existing mechanisms
      including, (1) the effect of olfactory loss on nutrition, life-threatening
      situations and social interactions, (2) associated neurodegenerative diseases,
      (3) accelerated brain aging, and (4) reflection of general health status being
      reflected in olfactory function.

TI  - Rural–Urban Differences in Hospitalizations for Opioid Use–Associated Infective
      Endocarditis in the United States, 2003–2016.
LID - ofaa045
AB  - Background: The incidence of infective endocarditis, a serious heart infection
      that can result from injection drug use, has increased in step with the opioid
      epidemic. Harm reduction services aimed at decreasing infectious complications of
      injection drug use are limited in rural areas; however, it is unknown whether the
      burden of opioid use–associated infective endocarditis varies between rural and
      urban populations. Methods: We used 2003–2016 National (Nationwide) Inpatient
      Sample data and joinpoint regression to compare trends in hospitalization for
      opioid use–associated infective endocarditis between rural and urban populations.
      Results: Rates of US hospitalizations for opioid use–associated infective
      endocarditis increased from 0.28 to 3.86 per 100 000 rural residents, as compared
      with 1.26 to 3.49 for urban residents (overall difference in annual percent
      change P < .01). We observed 2 distinct trend periods, with a period of little
      change between 2003 and 2009/2010 (annual percent change, 0.0% rural vs –0.08%
      urban) followed by a large increase in hospitalization rates between 2009/2010
      and 2016 (annual percent change, 0.35% rural vs 0.36% urban). Over the study
      period, opioid use–associated infective endocarditis hospitalizations shifted
      toward younger age groups for both rural and urban residents, and rural resident 
      hospitalizations increasingly occurred at urban teaching hospitals. For both
      groups, Medicaid was the most common payer. Conclusions: The increase in US
      hospitalizations for opioid use–associated infective endocarditis over the past
      decade supports the importance of public health efforts to reduce
      injection-related infections in both urban and rural areas. Future studies should
      examine factors affecting the higher increase in rate of these hospitalizations
      in rural areas.

TI  - Six-month retention and changes in quality of life and substance use from a
      low-threshold methadone maintenance therapy programme in Durban, South Africa.
LID - 13
AB  - Background: Emerging data points to a potential heroin use epidemic in South
      Africa. Despite this, access to methadone maintenance therapy and other
      evidence-based treatment options remains negligible. We aimed to assess
      retention, changes in substance use and quality of life after 6 months on
      methadone maintenance therapy provided through a low-threshold service in Durban,
      South Africa. Methods: We enrolled a cohort of 54 people with an opioid use
      disorder into the study. We reviewed and described baseline socio-demographic
      characteristics. Baseline and 6-month substance use was assessed using the World 
      Health Organization’s Alcohol Smoking and Substance Use Involvement Screening
      Test (ASSIST) and quality of life, using the SF-12. We compared changes at
      6 months on methadone to baseline using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and
      paired-tests for the ASSIST and SF-12 scores, respectively. McNemar’s test was
      used for comparisons between paired results of categorical variables relating to 
      injecting frequency. Results: The majority of the participants were young, Black 
      African males, with a history of drug use spanning over 10 years. Retention after
      6 months was 81%. After 6 months, the median heroin ASSIST score decreased from
      37 to 9 (p < 0.0001) and the cannabis ASSIST score increased from 12.5 to 21
      (p = 0.0003). The median mental health composite score of the SF-12 increased
      from 41.4 to 48.7 (p = 0.0254). Conclusions: Interim findings suggest high
      retention, significant reductions in heroin use and improvements in mental health
      among participants retained on methadone maintenance therapy for 6 months.
      Further research into longer term outcomes and the reasons contributing to these 
      changes would strengthen recommendations for the scale-up of methadone
      maintenance therapy in South Africa.

TI  - Gastrointestinal perforation: clinical and MDCT clues for identification of
      aetiology.
LID - 31
AB  - Gastrointestinal tract (GIT) perforation is a common medical emergency associated
      with considerable mortality, ranging from 30 to 50%. Clinical presentation
      varies: oesophageal perforations can present with acute chest pain, odynophagia
      and vomiting, gastroduodenal perforations with acute severe abdominal pain, while
      colonic perforations tend to follow a slower progression course with secondary
      bacterial peritonitis or localised abscesses. A subset of patients may present
      with delayed symptoms, abscess mimicking an abdominal mass, or with sepsis.Direct
      multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) findings support the diagnosis and
      localise the perforation site while ancillary findings may suggest underlying
      conditions that need further investigation following primary repair of ruptured
      bowel. MDCT findings include extraluminal gas, visible bowel wall discontinuity, 
      extraluminal contrast, bowel wall thickening, abnormal mural enhancement,
      localised fat stranding and/or free fluid, as well as localised phlegmon or
      abscess in contained perforations.The purpose of this article is to review the
      spectrum of MDCT findings encountered in GIT perforation and emphasise the MDCT
      and clinical clues suggestive of the underlying aetiology and localisation of
      perforation site.

TI  - The risk of deliberate self-harm following a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or
      ankylosing spondylitis: A population-based cohort study.
LID - e0229273
AB  - Objective: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are
      associated with mental illness. The risk of serious mental illness, including
      deliberate self-harm (DSH), in these conditions is not well known. We aimed to
      determine if RA or AS independently increases the risk for DSH. Methods: We
      conducted retrospective, population-based cohort studies using administrative
      health data for the province of Ontario, Canada between April 1, 2002 and March
      31, 2014. Individuals with incident RA (N = 53,240) or AS (N = 13,964) were
      separately matched 1:4 by age, sex, and year with comparators without RA or AS.
      The outcome was a first DSH attempt identified using emergency department data.
      We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for risk of
      DSH in RA and AS versus comparators, adjusting for demographic, clinical and
      health service utilization variables. Results: Subjects with AS were
      significantly more likely to self-harm (crude incidence rate [IR] of 0.68/1,000
      person years [PY] versus 0.32/1,000 PY in comparators), with an adjusted HR of
      1.59 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.21). DSH was increased for RA subjects (IR 0.35/1,000 PY) 
      versus comparators (IR 0.24/1,000 PY) only before (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.74),
      but not after covariate adjustment (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.33). Conclusions:
      AS carries an increased risk for DSH but no such risk was observed in RA. Further
      evaluation of at-risk AS subjects is needed, including the longitudinal effects
      of disease and arthritis therapies on self-harm behaviour. This will inform
      whether specific risk-reduction strategies for DSH in inflammatory arthritis are 
      needed.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of acupuncture on relieving abdominal pain and distension for
      acute pancreatitis: A protocol for systematic review.
LID - e19044
AB  - Introduction:: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of acupuncture on relieving abdominal pain and distension in acute pancreatitis. 
      Methods and analysis:: We will electronically search PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web
      of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, China National
      Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biomedical Literature Database, China Science
      Journal Database, and Wanfang Database from their inception. Furthermore, we will
      manually retrieve other resources, including reference lists of identified
      publications, conference articles, and gray literature. The clinical randomized
      controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials related to acupuncture
      treating acute pancreatitis will be included in the study. The language is
      limited to Chinese and English. Research selection, data extraction, and research
      quality assessment will be independently completed by 2 researchers. Data will be
      synthesized using a fixed effects model or random effects model depending on the 
      heterogeneity test. The overall response rate and the visual analog scale score
      will be the primary outcomes. The time of first bowel sound, the time of first
      defecation, the length of hospitalization, acute physiology and chronic health
      evaluation II score, and the adverse events will also be assessed as secondary
      outcomes. RevMan 5 (version 5.3) statistical software will be used for
      meta-analysis, and the level of evidence will be assessed by Grading of
      Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Continuous data will be 
      expressed in the form of weighted mean difference or standardized mean difference
      with 95% confidence intervals, whereas dichotomous data will be expressed in the 
      form of risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Ethics and dissemination:: The
      protocol of this systematic review does not require ethical approval because it
      does not involve humans. We will publish this article in peer-reviewed journals
      and present at relevant conferences. PROSPERO registration number::
      CRD42019147503.

TI  - Predictors of 1-year mortality in patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation
      after surgery in intensive care unit: a multicenter, retrospective cohort study.
LID - 44
AB  - Objectives: The requirement of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) is
      associated with increased medical care demand and expenses, high early and
      long-term mortality, and worse life quality. However, no study has assessed the
      prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality among PMV patients, not less 
      than 21 days after surgery. This study analyzed the predictors of 1-year
      mortality in patients requiring PMV in intensive care units (ICUs) after surgery.
      Methods: In this multicenter, respective cohort study, 124 patients who required 
      PMV after surgery in the ICUs of five tertiary hospitals in Beijing between
      January 2007 and June 2016 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the duration of
      survival within 1 year. Predictors of 1-year mortality were identified with a
      multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. The predictive effect of the ProVent
      score was also validated. Results: Of the 124 patients enrolled, the cumulative
      1-year mortality was 74.2% (92/124). From the multivariable Cox proportional
      hazard analysis, cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.14, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] 1.37–3.35; P < 0.01), no tracheostomy (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22–3.30;
      P < 0.01), enteral nutrition intolerance (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.19–2.97; P = 0.01),
      blood platelet count ≤150 × 109/L (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14–2.75; P = 0.01),
      requirement of vasopressors (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13–2.80; P = 0.02), and renal
      replacement therapy (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01–2.91; P = 0.047) on the 21st day of
      mechanical ventilation (MV) were associated with shortened 1-year survival.
      Conclusions: For patients who required PMV after surgery, cancer diagnosis, no
      tracheostomy, enteral nutrition intolerance, blood platelet count ≤150 × 109/L,
      vasopressor requirement, and renal replacement therapy on the 21st day of MV were
      associated with shortened 1-year survival. The prognosis in PMV patients in ICUs 
      can facilitate the decision-making process of physicians and patients’ family
      members on treatment schedule.

TI  - Aspirin and fracture risk: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis of
      observational studies.
LID - e026876
AB  - Objectives: This review provides insights into the potential for aspirin to
      preserve bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce fracture risk, building knowledge 
      of the risk-benefit profile of aspirin. Methods: We conducted a systematic review
      and exploratory meta-analysis of observational studies. Electronic searches of
      MEDLINE and Embase, and a manual search of bibliographies was undertaken for
      studies published to 28 March 2018. Studies were included if: participants were
      men or women aged ≥18 years; the exposure of interest was aspirin; and relative
      risks, ORs and 95% CIs for the risk of fracture or difference (percentage or
      absolute) in BMD (measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) between aspirin
      users and non-users were presented. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna
      Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklists for observational studies. Pooled 
      ORs for any fracture and standardised mean differences (SMDs) for BMD outcomes
      were calculated using random-effects models. Results: Twelve studies met the
      inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Aspirin use was
      associated with a 17% lower odds for any fracture (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99; 
      I2=71%; six studies; n=511 390). Aspirin was associated with a higher total hip
      BMD for women (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.07; I2=0%; three studies; n=9686) and 
      men (SMD 0.06, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.13, I2=0%; two studies; n=4137) although these
      associations were not significant. Similar results were observed for lumbar spine
      BMD in women (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.03 to 0.09; I2=34%; four studies; n=11 330) and
      men (SMD 0.08; 95% CI −0.01 to 0.18; one study; n=432). Conclusions: While the
      benefits of reduced fracture risk and higher BMD from aspirin use may be modest
      for individuals, if confirmed in prospective controlled trials, they may confer a
      large population benefit given the common use of aspirin in older people.

AB  - Morphine is a potent analgesic opiate commonly used in treating pain, and it is
      also a substance of abuse and highly addictive. Hence, it is vital to discover
      the action sites of morphine in the brain to increase its efficacy of treatment. 
      In the present study, we aimed at identifying comprehensive neuroanatomical
      locations that are sensitive to morphine in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). We
      performed in situ hybridization to localize the mu opioid receptor (oprm1) gene
      and to map the morphine sensitive brain areas using neuronal PAS
      domain-containing protein 4a (npas4a), an early gene marker. Real-time PCR was
      used to detect changes in mRNA levels of oprm1 and npas4a in control and acute
      morphine treated fish (2 mg/L; 20 min). Intense positive oprm1 signals were seen 
      in the telencephalon, preoptic area, habenula, hypothalamic area and
      periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum. Acute morphine exposure
      significantly increased oprm1 and npas4a mRNA levels in the medial zone of dorsal
      telencephalon (Dm), ventral region of the ventral telencephalon (Vv), preoptic
      area, and in the hypothalamus but a decrease in oprm1 and npas4a signals in the
      dorsal habenula. This study provides a detailed map of oprm1 localization in the 
      brain, which includes previously unreported oprm1 in the habenula of teleost.
      Presence of oprm1 in multiple brain sites implies multiple action targets of
      morphine and potential brain functions which could include reward, cognitive and 
      negative emotions.

TI  - Aromatase Inhibitors and Risk of Arthritis and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome among
      Taiwanese Women with Breast Cancer: A Nationwide Claims Data Analysis.
LID - 566
AB  - Tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy may prevent breast cancer
      recurrence, however, adverse effects may lead to treatment discontinuation.
      Evidence regarding the occurrence of AI-associated musculoskeletal problems among
      Asians is scarce. We identified women with breast cancer-initiating tamoxifen or 
      AIs from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (2007–2012).
      Using multivariable cause-specific hazard models, we examined the association
      between endocrine therapy and the risk of any arthritis and carpal tunnel
      syndrome, adjusting for age, prior cancer treatment, and other health status
      factors. Among 32,055 eligible women with breast cancer (mean age = 52.6 ± 11.5
      years), 87.4% initiated tamoxifen, 3.9% initiated anastrozole, 8.0% initiated
      letrozole, and 0.7% initiated exemestane. AI users had a higher 1-year cumulative
      incidence for any arthritis (13.0% vs. 8.2%, p < 0.0001) and carpal tunnel
      syndrome (1.4% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.008). Compared to tamoxifen users, AI users had a 
      higher risk of any arthritis [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.21, 95%CI =
      1.09–1.34] and carpal tunnel syndrome (aHR = 1.68, 95%CI = 1.22–2.32). No
      significant difference was observed in the risks of any arthritis and carpal
      tunnel syndrome across different AIs. Taxane use was not associated with any
      arthritis (aHR = 0.92, 95%CI = 0.81–1.05) or carpal tunnel syndrome (aHR = 0.97, 
      95%CI = 0.67–1.40) compared to other chemotherapies. Taiwanese women with breast 
      cancer-initiating AIs had an increased risk of arthritis and carpal tunnel
      syndrome compared to those who initiated tamoxifen.

TI  - Non-Adherence to Pharmacotherapy: A Prospective Multicentre Study About Its
      Incidence and Its Causes Perceived by Chronic Pain Patients.
PG  - 321-32
AB  - Objective: Pharmacological interventions remain the cornerstone of chronic pain
      treatment; however, nearly 40% of the prescription medicines are not taken as
      prescribed. The present study aims at understanding and describing non-adherence 
      from the perspective of chronic pain patients during a 1-year follow-up study.
      Methods: A cohort of 950 consecutive patients referred to a first consultation in
      Multidisciplinary Chronic Pain Clinics was followed with a standardized protocol 
      for 1 year. This included assessment of pain characteristics; prescribed
      medication; therapeutic adherence; effectiveness of treatment, non-adherence and 
      its perceived reasons; clinical outcomes and quality of life. We used a mixed
      methods approach, including qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results:
      Forty-nine percent of the 562 patients who responded to all assessments during
      follow-up were adherent after 1 year of chronic pain treatment. The core
      associations between each “non-adherence reason” and Anatomical Therapeutic
      Chemical Code (ATC) group were perceived side effects (p=0.019) and delayed start
      (p=0.022) for narcotic ﻿analgesics (opioids); perceived non-efficacy (p=0.017)
      and delayed start (p=0.004) for antiepileptics and anticonvulsants; perceived low
      necessity (p=0.041) and delayed start (p=0.036) for analgesics antipyretics;
      change in prescriptions because of a new clinical condition for antidepressants
      (p=0.024); high concerns (p=0.045) and change in prescriptions because of a new
      clinical condition (p<0.001) for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; delayed
      start (p=0.016) and financial constraints (p=0.018) for other medications.
      Discussion: This study emphasizes the patient’s perspective regarding
      non-adherence to pharmacological treatment of chronic pain, providing valuable
      and novel information to be used in future interventions to help patients make an
      informed choice about their adherence behavior.

TI  - The effectiveness of additional thoracic paravertebral block in improving the
      anesthetic effects of regional anesthesia for proximal humeral fracture surgery
      in elderly patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
LID - 204
AB  - Background: The innervation of the shoulder-upper-extremity area is complicated
      and unclear. Regional anesthesia with a brachial plexus and cervical plexus block
      is probably inadequate for the proximal humeral surgery. Missing blockade of the 
      T1–T2 nerves may be the reason. We conduct this prospective randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) to explore whether an additional T2 thoracic paravertebral block
      (TPVB) can improve the success rate of regional anesthesia for elderly patients
      in proximal humeral fracture surgery. Methods/design: The patients aged 65 years 
      or older, referred for anterior-approach proximal humeral fracture surgery, will 
      be enrolled. Each patient will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a combined
      interscalene brachial plexus with superficial cervical plexus block (IC)
      (combined interscalene brachial plexus with superficial cervical plexus block) or
      an IC block combined with thoracic paravertebral block (ICTP) block (combined
      thoracic paravertebral block with brachial plexus and superficial cervical plexus
      block). The primary outcome is the success rate of regional anesthesia without
      rescue analgesic methods. The secondary outcomes are as follows: sensory block at
      the surgical area, proportion of patients who need rescue anesthesia
      (intravenously administered remifentanil or conversion to general anesthesia),
      cumulative doses of intraoperative vasoactive medications and adverse events. The
      total sample size is estimated to be 80 patients. Discussion: This RCT aims to
      confirm whether an additional T2 TPVB can provide better anesthetic effects of
      regional anesthesia with brachial and cervical plexus block in elderly patients
      undergoing proximal humeral surgery. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: 
      NCT03919422. Registered on 19 April 2019.

TI  - Etorphine-Azaperone Immobilisation for Translocation of Free-Ranging Masai
      Giraffes (Giraffa Camelopardalis Tippelskirchi): A Pilot Study.
LID - 322
AB  - Simple Summary: Due to their peculiar anatomy and sensitivity to drugs, giraffes 
      are among the most challenging mammals to immobilise. Masai giraffes have
      recently been listed as endangered. Hence, their conservation needs actions that 
      require veterinary capture such as translocations. In this study, we evaluated a 
      new protocol of immobilisation for translocation of free-ranging Masai giraffes. 
      The hypothesis is that, by combining a potent opioid with a tranquiliser, it is
      possible to mitigate the capture stress, which is a major cause of disastrous
      homeostatic consequences, including capture myopathy and death. The combination
      produced, in all individuals, smooth and quick inductions and reliable
      immobilisations. Although hypoxaemia in a few individuals and acidosis were seen,
      the overall cardiorespiratory function was adequate. Whereas the initial stress
      to the capture was limited in the individuals, likely due to tourism-related
      habituation, the opioid-related excitement and resulting increased exertion was
      responsible for worse immobilisation and physiological derangement. A low dose of
      an antagonist was used and evaluated and, in the two-week boma follow-up, it
      proved to be efficient in providing safe recoveries and transport. At the
      investigated doses, the combination provided partially reversed immobilisation
      that allowed uneventful translocation in free-ranging Masai giraffes. Abstract:
      Etorphine-azaperone immobilisation was evaluated for translocation of Masai
      giraffes. Nine giraffes were darted with 0.012 ± 0.001 mg/kg etorphine and 0.07 ±
      0.01 mg/kg azaperone. Once ataxic, giraffes were roped for recumbency and
      restrained manually. Naltrexone (3 mg/mg etorphine) was immediately given
      intravenously to reverse etorphine-related side effects. Protocol evaluation
      included physiological monitoring, blood-gas analyses, anaesthetic times, and
      quality scores (1 = excellent, 4 = poor). Sedation onset and recumbency were
      achieved in 2.6 ± 0.8 and 5.6 ± 1.4 min. Cardio-respiratory function (HR = 70 ±
      16, RR = 32 ± 8, MAP = 132 ± 16) and temperature (37.8 ± 0.5) were stable.
      Arterial gas analysis showed hypoxaemia in some individuals (PaO2 = 67 ± 8 mmHg) 
      and metabolic acidosis (pH = 7.23 ± 0.05, PaCO2 = 34 ± 4 mmHg, HCO3− = 12.9 ± 1.2
      mmol/l). Minor startle response occurred, while higher induction-induced
      excitement correlated to longer inductions, worse restraint, and decreased HCO3−.
      After 19 ± 3.5 min of restraint, giraffes were allowed to stand and were loaded
      onto a chariot. Immobilisations were good and scored 2 (1–3). Inductions and
      recoveries were smooth and scored 1 (1–2). Translocations were uneventful and no 
      complications occurred in 14-days boma follow-up.

TI  - Postoperative delirium after major orthopedic surgery.
PG  - 90-106
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is one of the most common complications 
      in older adult patients undergoing elective surgery. Few studies have compared,
      within the same institution, the type of surgery, risk factors and type of
      anesthesia and analgesia associated with the development of POD. AIM: To
      investigate the following three questions: (1) What is the incidence of POD after
      non-ambulatory orthopedic surgery at a high-volume orthopedic specialty hospital?
      (2) Does surgical procedure influence incidence of POD after non-ambulatory
      orthopedic surgery? And (3) For POD after non-ambulatory orthopedic surgery, what
      are modifiable risk factors? METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted 
      of all non-ambulatory orthopedic surgeries at a single orthopedic specialty
      hospital between 2009 and 2014. Patients under 18 years were excluded from the
      cohort. Patient characteristics and medical history were obtained from electronic
      medical records. Patients with POD were identified using International
      Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes that were not present on
      admission. For incidence analyses, the cohort was grouped into total hip
      arthroplasty (THA), bilateral THA, total knee arthroplasty (TKA), bilateral TKA, 
      spine fusion, other spine procedures, femur/pelvic fracture, and other procedures
      using ICD-9 codes. For descriptive and regression analyses, the cohort was
      grouped, using ICD-9 codes, into THA, TKA, spinal fusions, and all procedures.
      RESULTS: Of 78492 surgical inpatient surgeries, the incidence from 2009 to 2014
      was 1.2% with 959 diagnosed with POD. The incidence of POD was higher in patients
      undergoing spinal fusions (3.3%) than for patients undergoing THA (0.8%); THA
      patients had the lowest incidence. Also, urgent and/or emergent procedures,
      defined by femoral and pelvic fractures, had the highest incidence of POD (7.2%) 
      than all other procedures. General anesthesia was not seen as a significant risk 
      factor for POD for any procedure type; however, IV patient-controlled analgesia
      was a significant risk factor for patients undergoing THA [Odds ratio (OR) =
      1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19 to 3.28, P = 0.008]. Significant risk
      factors for POD included advanced age (for THA, OR = 4.9, 95%CI: 3.0-7.9, P <
      0.001; for TKA, OR = 2.16, 95%CI: 1.58-2.94, P < 0.001), American Society of
      Anesthesiologists score of 3 or higher (for THA, OR = 2.01, 95%CI: 1.33-3.05, P <
      0.001), multiple medical comorbidities, hyponatremia (for THA, OR = 2.36, 95%CI: 
      1.54 to 3.64, P < 0.001), parenteral diazepam (for THA, OR = 5.05, 95%CI:
      1.5-16.97, P = 0.009; for TKA, OR = 4.40, 95%CI: 1.52-12.75, P = 0.007; for spine
      fusion, OR = 2.17, 95%CI: 1.19-3.97, P = 0.01), chronic opioid dependence (for
      THA, OR = 7.11, 95%CI: 3.26-15.51, P < 0.001; for TKA, OR = 2.98, 95%CI:
      1.38-6.41, P = 0.005) and alcohol dependence (for THA, OR = 5.05, 95%CI:
      2.72-9.37, P < 0.001; for TKA, OR = 6.40, 95%CI: 4.00-10.26, P < 0.001; for spine
      fusion, OR = 6.64, 95%CI: 3.72-11.85, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: POD is lower (1.2%)
      than previously reported; likely due to the use of multi-modal regional
      anesthesia and early ambulation. Both fixed and modifiable factors are
      identified.

TI  - Analgesic effects of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil on periprocedural pain
      during percutaneous ablation of renal carcinoma.
PG  - 52-7
AB  - Background: Percutaneous ablation of renal carcinoma is frequently a favourable
      treatment alternative, especially in elderly patients suffering from
      co-morbidities. Also, it is less resource-demanding than conventional surgery of 
      renal carcinoma, and one may, therefore, assume that the incidence of this
      procedure may increase. Analgesia is necessary during this intervention. The aim 
      of this study was to explore the possibility of analgosedation and its relation
      to patient comfort and safety during percutaneous ablation of renal
      carcinoma.Methods: Forty-six patients, sedated with dexmedetomidine and
      remifentanil, supplemented with infiltration anaesthesia (lidocaine 1%),
      underwent percutaneous (radiofrequency or microwave) ablation of renal carcinoma 
      in this prospective study.Results: The patients expected pain intensity around
      the numerical rating score (NRS) 4.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 3.5–5.5), which
      was slightly lower than pain experienced during the procedure NRS 5 (IQR 2–7;
      p = 0.49). Eight percent of the patients needed supplementary morphine during the
      ablation procedure. Sedation score did not differ during ablation, at arrival to 
      or discharge from the recovery ward. Median periprocedural treatment time was
      12 minutes (IQR 12–16). Treatment time did not correlate with experienced pain
      (R2=0.000074, p = 0.96). The median length of stay in the recovery room was
      120 minutes (IQR 84–154). There were seven serious adverse events.Conclusions:
      This proof-of-concept study has shown that analgosedation during percutaneous
      ablation of renal carcinoma can be performed with a generally tolerable degree of
      patient satisfaction. However, pain occurs and should be managed adequately.
      Patient safety must be a major concern for the anaesthetic care.

TI  - Pramipexole in peritoneal dialysis patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS): a 
      protocol for a multicentre double-blind randomised controlled trial.
LID - e033815
AB  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sensorimotor 
      disorder among patients with end stage renal disease. This clinical trial aimed
      to provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of pramipexole in patients with
      uremic RLS receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods and analysis: This is a
      12-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial. In total, 104 patients with uremic RLS receiving PD will be enrolled from 
      four hospitals and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either placebo or
      pramipexole. We will determine the efficacy of pramipexole in the improvement of 
      International RLS Study Group Rating Scale as the primary outcome, while
      responder rates for other RLS scales at week 12, change from baseline to week 12 
      for psychological status, sleep disorder and quality of life and blood pressure
      represent the secondary outcomes. Ethics and dissemination: The study was
      approved by the ethics committees of Peking University First Hospital, Xinqiao
      hospital of Army Medical University, Cangzhou Center Hospital and Peking
      University Shenzhen Hospital. The results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed
      journals. Trial registration number: NCT03817554

TI  - High-flow nasal oxygenation versus standard oxygenation for gastrointestinal
      endoscopy with sedation. The prospective multicentre randomised controlled ODEPHI
      study protocol.
LID - e034701
AB  - Introduction: Hypoxaemia is a major complication during gastrointestinal
      endoscopy (GIE) procedures (upper/lower) when performed under deep sedation in
      the procedure room. Standard oxygen therapy (SOT) is used to prevent hypoxaemia. 
      Data suggest that risk factors for hypoxaemia under deep sedation during GIE are 
      obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, a body mass index above 30 kg/m², high blood
      pressure, diabetes, heart disease, age over 60 years old, high American Society
      of Anesthesiologists physical status class and the association of upper and lower
      GIE. High-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) may potentially improve oxygenation
      during GIE under deep sedation. We hypothesised that HFNO could decrease the
      incidence of hypoxaemia in comparison with SOT. Methods and analysis: The ODEPHI 
      (High-flow nasal oxygenation versus standard oxygenation for gastrointestinal
      endoscopy with sedation. The prospective multicentre randomised controlled) study
      is a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing HFNO to SOT during GIE
      (upper and/or lower) under deep sedation administered by anaesthesiologists in
      the procedure room. Three hundred and eighty patients will be randomised with a
      1:1 ratio in two parallel groups.The primary outcome is the occurrence of
      hypoxaemia, defined by a pulse oximetry measurement of peripheral capillary
      oxygen saturation (SpO2) below or equal to 92% during the GIE procedure.
      Secondary outcomes include prolonged hypoxaemia, severe hypoxaemia, need for
      manoeuvres to maintain upper airway patency and other adverse events. Ethics and 
      dissemination: This study has been approved by the ethics committee (CPP Sud Est 
      Paris V, France), and patients are included after informed consent. The results
      will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. As provided for by
      French law, patients participating in the study are informed that they have the
      possibility to ask the investigators, once the study is completed, to be informed
      of the overall results of the study. Thus, a summary of the results will be sent 
      by post to the participants on request. Trial registration number:
      ClinicalTrials.gov Registry (NCT03829293).

TI  - Experiences of people taking opioid medication for chronic non-malignant pain: a 
      qualitative evidence synthesis using meta-ethnography.
LID - e032988
AB  - Objective: To review qualitative studies on the experience of taking opioid
      medication for chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) or coming off them. Design: This
      is a qualitative evidence synthesis using a seven-step approach from the methods 
      of meta-ethnography. Data sources and eligibility criteria: We searched selected 
      databases—Medline, Embase, AMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
      Literature, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus (Science Citation Index and
      Social Science Citation Index)—for qualitative studies which provide patients’
      views of taking opioid medication for CNMP or of coming off them (June 2017,
      updated September 2018). Data extraction and synthesis: Papers were quality
      appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool, and the
      GRADE-CERQual (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
      working group - Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research)
      guidelines were applied. We identified concepts and iteratively abstracted these 
      concepts into a line of argument. Results: We screened 2994 unique citations and 
      checked 153 full texts, and 31 met our review criteria. We identified five
      themes: (1) reluctant users with little choice; (2) understanding opioids: the
      good and the bad; (3) a therapeutic alliance: not always on the same page; (4)
      stigma: feeling scared and secretive but needing support; and (5) the challenge
      of tapering or withdrawal. A new overarching theme of ‘constantly balancing’
      emerged from the data. Conclusions: People taking opioids were constantly
      balancing tensions, not always wanting to take opioids, and weighing the pros and
      cons of opioids but feeling they had no choice because of the pain. They
      frequently felt stigmatised, were not always ‘on the same page’ as their
      healthcare professional and felt changes in opioid use were often challenging.

TI  - The Surgeon's Role in the Opioid Crisis: A Narrative Review and Call to Action.
LID - 4
AB  - Over the past two decades, there has been a sharp rise in the use of prescription
      opioids. In several countries, most notably the United States, opioid-related
      harm has been deemed a public health crisis. As surgeons are among the most
      prolific prescribers of opioids, growing attention is now being paid to the role 
      that opioids play in surgical care. While opioids may sometimes be necessary to
      provide patients with adequate relief from acute pain after major surgery, the
      impact of opioids on the quality and safety of surgical care calls for greater
      scrutiny. This narrative review summarizes the available evidence on rates of
      persistent postsurgical opioid use and highlights the need to target known risk
      factors for persistent postoperative use before patients present for surgery. We 
      draw attention to the mounting evidence that preoperative opioid exposure places 
      patients at risk of persistent postoperative use, while also contributing to an
      increased risk of several other adverse clinical outcomes. By discussing the
      prevalence of excess opioid prescribing following surgery and highlighting
      significant variations in prescribing practices between countries, we note that
      there is a pressing need to optimize postoperative prescribing practices. Guided 
      by the available evidence, we call for specific actions to be taken to address
      important research gaps and alleviate the harms associated with opioid use among 
      surgical patients.

TI  - Acute Pancreatitis Due to Disseminated Varicella Zoster Infection in an
      Individual with Newly Diagnosed Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
LID - e7027
AB  - Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection is generally considered as a benign and
      self-limiting disease. However, individuals with VZV infection can have
      disseminated to various organs leading to serious complications, particularly in 
      adults. This pattern is more prevalent in immunosuppressed individuals.
      Disseminated varicella is historically known to involve the central nervous
      system (CNS), liver, and lungs. However, dissemination of varicella to the
      pancreas and subsequently causing acute pancreatitis has been rarely reported.We 
      present a case of disseminated varicella infection in a newly diagnosed human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient causing acute pancreatitis at initial
      disease presentation and subsequently leading to multi organ dysfunction.A
      42-year-old African American female who was initially being treated for
      Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) at an inner-city hospital developed severe
      epigastric pain radiating to back along with nausea on day 2 of admission.
      Physical findings revealed tachycardia, epigastric tenderness and newly formed
      vesicular rash involving the neck and face classical of varicella infection. Skin
      biopsy and serum sample confirmed varicella infection by VZV polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) test. Labs revealed elevated lipase, amylase at a level diagnostic
      of acute pancreatitis. The patient had no other risk factors for pancreatitis.
      She was started on intravenous Acyclovir and intravenous hydration with isotonic 
      normal saline. She was managed conservatively for other systemic complications.
      Pancreatitis resolved after five days of clinical presentation. She completed two
      weeks of Acyclovir, her condition steadily improved and she was successfully
      discharged home with no further recurrence.Acute pancreatitis is a rare
      infectious association of disseminated varicella infection. Clinicians should
      always be mindful of this infectious etiology as one of the rare differentials
      for acute pancreatitis as this is a treatable cause and could prevent morbidity, 
      mortality associated with this condition if treated timely.

TI  - The Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Treatment Gap: A National Study of Substance Use 
      Disorder Treatment.
LID - 1178221820904150
AB  - Background:: Anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) use is associated with serious
      mental and physical health problems. Evidence indicates that AAS use among people
      who use psychoactive substances is higher than in the general population. This
      study aims to estimate lifetime AAS use among patients in substance use disorder 
      (SUD) treatment, compare characteristics of AAS and non-AAS users and identify
      whether AAS use was addressed during treatment. Methods:: This cross-sectional
      survey included 563 (142 women, 24.2%) patients in 38 SUD treatment facilities in
      Norway. Respondents reported on AAS and substance use, and treatment experiences.
      Results:: Lifetime AAS use was reported by 156 (28.3%) SUD patients, thereof
      35.6% of the men and 8.0% of the women. Lifetime AAS use was highest among men
      with stimulants (55.8%) as preferred substance, and lowest among men who
      preferred alcohol (14.6%). Initiation of AAS use due to getting thinner following
      substance use was reported by 44.5% of the AAS using men. AAS users reported more
      severe substance use than non-AAS users. More than half (58%) of all patients had
      not been asked about AAS use, and 42.4% of those who were asked, experienced that
      treatment providers lacked expertise about AAS. Conclusion:: Lifetime AAS use in 
      this sample of SUD patients is common practice and comprise an underrecognized
      problem in SUD treatment. Given the deleterious implications to the individual
      and society that concomitant use of AAS may cause, it would be essential to raise
      the awareness about AAS use among SUD patients, and the level of competence among
      health professionals.

TI  - Timing is everything: Early do-not-resuscitate orders in the intensive care unit 
      and patient outcomes.
LID - e0227971
AB  - Background: The use of Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders has increased but many are
      placed late in the dying process. This study is to determine the association
      between the timing of DNR order placement in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
      nurses’ perceptions of patients’ distress and quality of death. Methods: 200 ICU 
      patients and the nurses (n = 83) who took care of them during their last week of 
      life were enrolled from the medical ICU and cardiac care unit of New York
      Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan and the surgical ICU at
      the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Nurses were interviewed about their
      perceptions of the patients’ quality of death using validated measures. Patients 
      were divided into 3 groups—no DNR, early DNR, late DNR placement during the
      patient’s final ICU stay. Logistic regression analyses modeled perceived patient 
      quality of life as a function of timing of DNR order placement. Patient’s
      comorbidities, length of ICU stay, and procedures were also included in the
      model. Results: 59 patients (29.5%) had a DNR placed within 48 hours of ICU
      admission (early DNR), 110 (55%) placed after 48 hours of ICU admission (late
      DNR), and 31 (15.5%) had no DNR order placed. Compared to patients without DNR
      orders, those with an early but not late DNR order placement had significantly
      fewer non-beneficial procedures and lower odds of being rated by nurses as not
      being at peace (Adjusted Odds Ratio namely AOR = 0.30; [CI = 0.09–0.94]), and
      experiencing worst possible death (AOR = 0.31; [CI = 0.1–0.94]) before
      controlling for procedures; and consistent significance in severe suffering (AOR 
      = 0.34; [CI = 0.12–0.96]), and experiencing a severe loss of dignity (AOR = 0.33;
      [CI = 0.12–0.94]), controlling for non-beneficial procedures. Conclusions:
      Placement of DNR orders within the first 48 hours of the terminal ICU admission
      was associated with fewer non-beneficial procedures and less perceived suffering 
      and loss of dignity, lower odds of being not at peace and of having the worst
      possible death.

TI  - National U.S. time-trends in opioid use disorder hospitalizations and associated 
      healthcare utilization and mortality.
LID - e0229174
AB  - Background: The opioid epidemic is a major public health crisis in the U.S.
      Contemporary data on opioid use disorder (OUD) related hospitalizations are
      needed. Our objective was to assess whether OUD hospitalizations and associated
      mortality are increasing over time and examine the factors associated healthcare 
      utilization and mortality. Methods and findings: We examined the rates of OUD
      hospitalizations and associated mortality using the U.S. National Inpatient
      Sample (NIS) data from 1998–2016. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression
      assessed the association of demographic, clinical and hospital characteristics
      with inpatient mortality and healthcare utilization (total hospital charges,
      discharge to a rehabilitation facility, length of hospital stay) during the index
      hospitalization for opioid use disorder. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and
      95% confidence intervals (CI). We estimated 781,767 OUD hospitalizations. The
      rate of OUD hospitalization and associated mortality (/100,000 overall NIS
      hospitalizations) increased from 59.8 and 1.2 in 1998–2000 to 190.7 and 5.9 in
      2015–16, respectively. In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, the following
      factors were associated with worse outcomes; compared to age <34 years, older age
      was associated with higher risk of hospital charges above the median and length
      of stay >3 days, slightly higher risk of discharge to a rehabilitation facility. 
      Higher Deyo-Charlson score was associated with higher hospital charges, length of
      hospital stay, and inpatient mortality. Women had lower odds of inpatient
      mortality than men and blacks had lower odds of mortality than whites.
      Conclusions: Rising OUD hospitalizations from 1998 to 2016 and increasing
      associated inpatient mortality are concerning. Certain groups are at higher risk 
      of poor utilization outcomes and inpatient mortality. Resources and healthcare
      policies need to focus on the high-risk group to reduce mortality and associated 
      utilization.

TI  - Compliance of private pharmacies in Uganda with controlled prescription drugs
      regulations: a mixed-methods study.
LID - 16
AB  - Background: Controlled prescription drug use disorders are a growing global
      health challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. Effective supply chain regulations on
      dispensing and stock control are important for controlling this epidemic. Since
      compliance with these regulations in resource-limited countries is poor, there is
      need to understand its predictors in order to reduce the risk of prescription
      drug use disorders. Methods: A mixed-methods study utilizing a structured
      questionnaire and a simulated client guide was undertaken in Kampala and Mbale
      towns in Uganda. The questionnaire recorded self-reported dispensing and verified
      stock control practices and their covariates from 101 private pharmacies. The
      guide recorded actual dispensing practices from 27 pharmacies. Snowball sampling 
      was done to enrich the sample with pharmacies that stock opioids. The mean
      compliance with good dispensing and stock control practices was calculated.
      Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of 
      compliance. Results: The mean compliance with dispensing and stock control
      requirements was 82.9% and 23%, respectively. Twenty percent and 40% of the
      pharmacies dispensed pethidine without a prescription and with invalid
      prescriptions, respectively. Having a pharmacist on duty (OR = 5.17; p = 0.02),
      prior in-service training on narcotics regulations (OR = 3.51; p = 0.04), and
      previous narcotics audits by the regulator (OR = 5.11; p = 0.01) were independent
      predictors of compliance with stock control requirements. Pharmacies with a
      previous history of poor compliance with dispensing requirements were less likely
      to demonstrate good compliance (OR = 0.21; p = 0.01). Conclusions: There is
      suboptimal compliance to controlled prescription drug regulations among Uganda’s 
      pharmacies. A previous history of poor compliance to dispensing requirements
      predicted low compliance in subsequent assessments. Training and regulatory
      audits increased compliance in stock control but not dispensing. Expansion of
      training and audits to more pharmacies and/or incentives for compliance are
      necessary.

TI  - Metabolomics in Psychiatric Disorders: What We Learn from Animal Models.
LID - 72
AB  - Biomarkers are a recent research target within biological factors of psychiatric 
      disorders. There is growing evidence for deriving biomarkers within psychiatric
      disorders in serum or urine samples in humans, however, few studies have
      investigated this differentiation in brain or cerebral fluid samples in
      psychiatric disorders. As brain samples from humans are only available at
      autopsy, animal models are commonly applied to determine the pathogenesis of
      psychiatric diseases and to test treatment strategies. The aim of this review is 
      to summarize studies on biomarkers in animal models for psychiatric disorders.
      For depression, anxiety and addiction disorders studies, biomarkers in animal
      brains are available. Furthermore, several studies have investigated psychiatric 
      medication, e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants, or mood stabilizers, in
      animals. The most notable changes in biomarkers in depressed animal models were
      related to the glutamate-γ-aminobutyric acid-glutamine-cycle. In anxiety models, 
      alterations in amino acid and energy metabolism (i.e., mitochondrial regulation) 
      were observed. Addicted animals showed several biomarkers according to the
      induced drugs. In summary, animal models provide some direct insights into the
      cellular metabolites that are produced during psychiatric processes. In addition,
      the influence on biomarkers due to short- or long-term medication is a noticeable
      finding. Further studies should combine representative animal models and human
      studies on cerebral fluid to improve insight into mental disorders and advance
      the development of novel treatment strategies.

TI  - Are Larger Litters a Concern for Piglet Survival or An Effectively Manageable
      Trait?
LID - 309
AB  - Simple Summary: In the swine industry, sows are selectively bred for larger
      litters so, theoretically, more pigs can be sold per year. As producers continue 
      to increase the number of piglets born in a litter, it is necessary to review
      problems that can arise in larger litters, and whether these issues can be
      effectively managed and/or require pharmacological intervention. Additionally,
      this review will reflect on whether selecting sows for larger litter sizes is an 
      ethical concern, regardless of how effectively it can be managed. Abstract: As
      sows continue to be selected for greater prolificacy, it is important to review
      problems that arise in larger litters, and whether these issues can be
      appropriately managed. Although a proportion of piglets in larger litters can be 
      born underweight, proper supervision around farrowing and adequate colostrum
      intake has the potential to improve the survival of low-birth-weight piglets and 
      their ongoing growth to weaning. As larger litters can impart greater stress and 
      discomfort on sows, implementing a low-stress environment leading up to
      parturition may improve sow performance and subsequent survival of piglets.
      Additionally, treating sows with anti-inflammatory compounds, either dietary or
      pharmacologically, shows some promise for alleviating sow discomfort and
      improving piglet survival in larger litters. Understanding that selecting sows
      for larger litters not only affects piglet survival but the well-being of the
      sow, the decision to continue selecting for larger litters, regardless of
      management strategies, remains a topic of ethical concern.

TI  - Network Pharmacology Study on the Pharmacological Mechanism of Cinobufotalin
      Injection against Lung Cancer.
LID - 1246742
AB  - Cinobufotalin injection, extracted from the skin of Chinese giant salamander or
      black sable, has good clinical effect against lung cancer. However, owing to its 
      complex composition, the pharmacological mechanism of cinobufotalin injection has
      not been fully clarified. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of action of 
      cinobufotalin injection against lung cancer using network pharmacology and
      bioinformatics. Compounds of cinobufotalin injection were determined by
      literature retrieval, and potential therapeutic targets of cinobufotalin
      injection were screened from Swiss Target Prediction and STITCH databases.
      Lung-cancer-related genes were summarized from GeneCards, OMIM, and DrugBank
      databases. The pharmacological mechanism of cinobufotalin injection against lung 
      cancer was determined by enrichment analysis of gene ontology and Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and protein-protein interaction network was
      constructed. We identified 23 compounds and 506 potential therapeutic targets of 
      cinobufotalin injection, as well as 70 genes as potential therapeutic targets of 
      cinobufotalin injection in lung cancer by molecular docking. The antilung cancer 
      effect of cinobufotalin injection was shown to involve cell cycle, cell
      proliferation, antiangiogenesis effect, and immune inflammation pathways, such as
      PI3K-Akt, VEGF, and the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. In network
      analysis, the hub targets of cinobufotalin injection against lung cancer were
      identified as VEGFA, EGFR, CCND1, CASP3, and AKT1. A network diagram of
      “drug-compounds-target-pathway” was constructed through network pharmacology to
      elucidate the pharmacological mechanism of the antilung cancer effect of
      cinobufotalin injection, which is conducive to guiding clinical medication.

TI  - Risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations: a qualitative study of the perspectives of Australian general
      practitioners.
LID - e034363
AB  - Objective: To explore the perspectives of general practitioners (GPs) concerning 
      the risk of opioid misuse in people with cancer and pain and related clinical
      considerations. Design: A qualitative approach using semistructured telephone
      interviews. Analysis used an integrative approach. Setting: Primary care.
      Participants: Australian GPs with experience of prescribing opioids for people
      with cancer and pain. Results: Twenty-two GPs participated, and three themes
      emerged. Theme 1 (Misuse is not the main problem) contextualised misuse as a
      relatively minor concern compared with pain control and toxicity, and highlighted
      underlying systemic factors, including limitations in continuity of care and
      doctor expertise. Theme 2 (‘A different mindset’ for cancer pain) captured
      participants’ relative comfort in prescribing opioids for pain in cancer versus
      non-cancer contexts, and acknowledgement that compassion and greater perceived
      community acceptance were driving factors, in addition to scientific support for 
      mechanisms and clinical efficacy. Participant attitudes towards prescribing for
      people with cancer versus non-cancer pain differed most when cancer was in the
      palliative phase, when they were unconcerned by misuse. Participants were
      equivocal about the risk–benefit ratio of long-term opioid therapy in the chronic
      phase of cancer, and were reluctant to prescribe for disease-free survivors.
      Theme 3 (‘The question is always, ‘how lazy have you been?’) captured
      participants’ acknowledgement that they sometimes prescribed opioids for cancer
      pain as a default, easier option compared with more holistic pain management.
      Conclusions: Findings highlight the role of specific clinical considerations in
      distinguishing risk of opioid misuse in the cancer versus non-cancer population, 
      rather than diagnosis per se. Further efforts are needed to ensure continuity of 
      care where opioid prescribing is shared. Greater evidence is needed to guide
      opioid prescribing in disease-free survivors and the chronic phase of cancer,
      especially in the context of new treatments for metastatic disease.

TI  - Is marijuana use associated with decreased use of prescription opioids?
      Toxicological findings from two US national samples of drivers.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: State governments in the United States are increasingly viewing
      marijuana legalization as a policy option for controlling the opioid epidemic
      under the premise that marijuana is a less harmful substitute for opioids. The
      purpose of this study is to assess whether marijuana use is associated with
      decreased odds of prescription opioid use. Methods: A cross-sectional study
      design was applied to toxicological testing data from two national samples of
      drivers: 1) the 2011–2016 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and 2) the
      2013–2014 National Roadside Survey of Alcohol and Drug Use by Drivers (NRS).
      Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimated from
      multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of 
      marijuana use with prescription opioid use and alcohol use. Results: Among the
      47,602 drivers from the FARS, 15.7% tested positive for marijuana and 6.9%
      positive for prescription opioids. Compared with drivers testing negative for
      marijuana, those testing positive for marijuana were 28% more likely to test
      positive for prescription opioids (adjusted OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.15–1.42). Among
      the 7881 drivers from the NRS, 7.9% tested positive for marijuana and 4.5%
      positive for prescription opioids. Relative to drivers testing negative for
      marijuana, those testing positive for marijuana were twice as likely to test
      positive for prescription opioids (adjusted OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.29–3.20). In
      both study samples, marijuana use was associated with significantly increased
      odds of alcohol positivity. Conclusions: Drivers who test positive for marijuana 
      are significantly more likely to test positive for prescription opioids.
      Longitudinal studies with rigorous designs and toxicological testing data are
      needed to further address the substitution hypothesis between marijuana and
      prescription opioids.

TI  - The opioid mortality epidemic in North America: do we understand the supply side 
      dynamics of this unprecedented crisis?
LID - 14
AB  - While there has been extensive attention to the ‘demand side’ – or use and
      adverse consequences, including mortality – of the ‘opioid crisis’ presently
      unfolding across North America, few considerations have focused on the supply
      side. This paper examines the supply side dynamics of this unprecedented public
      health phenomenon. We provide evidence for several interrelated supply-side
      elements that have contributed to the present public health crisis. We observe
      that initially, persistently high levels of prescription opioid availability and 
      use exposed large proportions of the North American population to opioids,
      resulting in correspondingly high levels of medical and non-medical use (e.g.,
      involving diversion). While various intervention measures to control prescription
      opioid availability and use have been implemented in recent years, leading to
      eventual reductions in opioid dispensing levels, these occurred late in the
      crisis’s evolution. Moreover, these supply reductions have not been met by
      corresponding reductions in opioid use or demand levels. These growing
      discrepancies between opioid demand and prescription-based sources have left
      major gaps in opioid supplies. In response to such supply gaps, highly potent and
      toxic illicit opioid products have rapidly proliferated across North America, and
      become a core driver of the dramatic spikes in opioid overdose fatality levels in
      recent years. These supply-related interrelations are corroborated by a
      corresponding increase in illicit opioid-related fatalities, which arose just as 
      medical opioid supplies began to decrease in many jurisdictions. Improved
      analyses and understanding of the supply-side dynamics of the opioid crisis are
      urgently needed in order to inform future intervention and policy development.
      Meanwhile, the high mortality toll related to illicit, highly toxic opioid
      exposure requires sustained solutions, including supply-oriented measures (e.g., 
      safer opioid distribution for at–risk users) towards improved public health
      protection.

TI  - Focus on Clozapine Withdrawal- and Misuse-Related Cases as Reported to the
      European Medicines Agency (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Database.
LID - 105
AB  - Background: Clozapine is of high clinical relevance for the management of both
      treatment-resistant schizophrenia and psychotic disturbances with concurrent drug
      misuse. Although the molecule presents with a range of well-known side-effects,
      its discontinuation/withdrawal syndrome has been only anecdotally described.
      Aims: the 2005–2018 European Medicines Agency (EMA) dataset of Adverse Drug
      Reactions (ADRs) was analyzed to identify and describe possible clozapine
      withdrawal- and misuse-/abuse-/dependence-related issues. Method: A descriptive
      analysis of clozapine-related ADRs was performed when available, data on ADRs’
      outcome, dosage, and possible concomitant drug(s) were considered. Results: Out
      of 11,847 clozapine-related ADRs, some 599 (5.05%) were related to
      misuse/abuse/dependence/withdrawal issues, including 258 withdrawal-related
      (43.1%); 241 abuse-related (40.2%); and 80 intentional product misuse-related
      (13.3%) ADRs. A small number of overdose- and suicide-related ADRs were reported 
      as well. Clozapine was typically (69.2%) identified alone, and most (84.7%)
      fatalities/high-dosage intake instances were reported in association with a
      history of substance abuse. Conclusions: Previous suggestions about the
      possibility of a clozapine discontinuation/withdrawal occurrence are here
      supported, but further studies are needed. However, the misuse/abuse cases here
      identified might be difficult to interpret, given the lack of studies
      highlighting the possible recreational use of clozapine. The high-dosage intake, 
      fatal outcomes and clozapine/polydrug abuse issues reported here may, however, be
      a reason for concern.

TI  - Randomised controlled trial to investigate the relationship between mild
      hypercapnia and cerebral oxygen saturation in patients undergoing major surgery.
LID - e029159
AB  - Objectives: The effects of hypercapnia on regional cerebral oxygen saturation
      (rSO2) during surgery are unclear. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to 
      investigate the relationship between mild hypercapnia and rSO2. We hypothesised
      that, compared with targeted normocapnia (TN), targeted mild hypercapnia (TMH)
      during major surgery would increase rSO2. Design: A prospective, randomised,
      controlled trial in adult participants undergoing elective major surgery.
      Setting: A single tertiary centre in Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.
      Participants: 40 participants were randomised to either a TMH or TN group (20 to 
      each). Interventions: TMH (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, 
      PaCO2, 45–55 mm Hg) or TN (PaCO2 35–40 mm Hg) was delivered via controlled
      ventilation throughout surgery. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The
      primary endpoint was the absolute difference between the two groups in percentage
      change in rSO2 from baseline to completion of surgery. Secondary endpoints
      included intraoperative pH, bicarbonate concentration, base excess, serum
      potassium concentration, incidence of postoperative delirium and length of stay
      (LOS) in hospital. Results: The absolute difference between the two groups in
      percentage change in rSO2 from the baseline to the completion of surgery was
      19.0% higher in both hemispheres with TMH (p<0.001). On both sides, the
      percentage change in rSO2 was greater in the TMH group than the TN group
      throughout the duration of surgery. The difference between the groups became more
      noticeable over time. Furthermore, postoperative delirium was higher in the TN
      group (risk difference 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5, p=0.02). LOS was similar between
      groups (5 days vs 5 days; p=0.99). Conclusion: TMH was associated with a stable
      increase in rSO2 from the baseline, while TN was associated with a decrease in
      rSO2 in both hemispheres in patients undergoing major surgery. This resulted in a
      clear separation of percentage change in rSO2 from the baseline between TMH and
      TN over time. Our findings provide the rationale for larger studies on TMH during
      surgery. Trial registration number: The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials
      Registry (ACTRN12616000320459).

TI  - Impact of Lung Compliance on Neurological Outcome in Patients with Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome Following Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.
LID - 527
AB  - (1) Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following cardiac
      arrest is common and associated with in-hospital mortality. We aim to investigate
      whether lung compliance during targeted temperature management is associated with
      neurological outcome in patients with ARDS after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
      (OHCA). (2) Methods: This observational study is conducted in the emergency
      intensive care unit from January 2011 to April 2019 using data from a prospective
      patient registry. Adult patients (age ≥18 years) who survived non-traumatic OHCA 
      and subsequently developed ARDS based on the Berlin definition are included.
      Mechanical ventilator parameters such as plateau pressure, tidal volume, minute
      ventilation, positive end expiratory pressure, and compliance are recorded for 7 
      days or until death, and categorized as maximum, median, and minimum. The primary
      outcome is a favorable neurological outcome defined as a Cerebral Performance
      Category score of 1 or 2 at hospital discharge. (3) Results: Regarding 246 OHCA
      survivors, 119 (48.4%) patients developed ARDS. A favorable neurologic outcome
      was observed in 23 (19.3%). Patients with a favorable outcome have a
      significantly higher lung compliance (38.6 mL/cm H2O versus 27.5 mL/cm H2O),
      lower inspiratory pressure (12.0 cm H2O versus 16.0 cm H2O), and lower plateau
      pressure (17.0 cm H2O versus 21.0 cm H2O) than those with a poor neurologic
      outcome (all p < 0.01). Concerning time-dependent cox regression models, all
      maximum (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      1.02–1.09), minimum (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03–1.13), and median (HR 1.06, 95% CI
      1.02–1.09) compliances are independently associated with a good neurologic
      outcome. Maximum compliance, >32.5 mL/cm H2O at day 1, has the highest area under
      the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.745) with a positive predictive
      value of 90.4%. (4) Conclusions: Lung compliance may be an early predictor of
      intact neurologic survival in patients with ARDS following cardiac arrest.

TI  - Ethnopharmacological Applications Targeting Alcohol Abuse: Overview and Outlook.
LID - 1593
AB  - Excessive alcohol consumption is the cause of several diseases and thus is of a
      major concern for society. Worldwide alcohol consumption has increased by many
      folds over the past decades. This urgently calls for intervention and relapse
      counteract measures. Modern pharmacological solutions induce complete alcohol
      self-restraint and prevent relapse, but they have many side effects. Natural
      products are most promising as they cause fewer adverse effects. Here we discuss 
      in detail the medicinal plants used in various traditional/folklore medicine
      systems for targeting alcohol abuse. We also comprehensively describe preclinical
      and clinical studies done on some of these plants along with the possible
      mechanisms of action.

TI  - Survey of Addiction Specialists’ Use of Medications to Treat Alcohol Use
      Disorder.
LID - 47
AB  - Objectives: Several medications have been shown to be safe and effective for
      treating alcohol use disorder (AUD); however, these medications are prescribed
      infrequently. We conducted a survey of the demographics, practice
      characteristics, and self-perceived knowledge, experience, and opinions of
      addiction specialists on the use of AUD medications and how to increase their
      use. Methods: We sent a 19-question survey to members of the American Society of 
      Addiction Medicine (ASAM) and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry
      (AAAP). Results: We received a total of 395 responses from ASAM members and 194
      responses from AAAP members. One hundred of the respondents were members of both 
      organizations. The large majority of respondents (92.6%) were prescribers, and
      81.6% were non-trainee physicians. The two most frequently used medications for
      treating AUD were oral naltrexone (27%) and long-acting naltrexone (18%).
      Respondents were significantly more confident in the strength of the research
      findings and evidence for the efficacy and safety of naltrexone than other AUD
      medications (p < 0.001 ). Respondents identified additional education to current 
      providers about existing medications as the most important potential intervention
      to increase the use of AUD medications. Conclusions: Compared with a survey
      published in 2001, in 2018 the proportion of respondents who reported using
      naltrexone more than doubled and addiction specialists were more confident in
      their use of AUD medications, rating their efficacy and safety more highly.
      Consistent with findings from other recent studies, providing more education to
      practitioners about existing AUD medications may be the most effective way to
      increase their use.

TI  - Are Anticholinergic Medications Associated With Increased Risk of Dementia and
      Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia? A Nationwide 15-Year Follow-Up
      Cohort Study in Taiwan.
LID - 30
AB  - Background/Objective: In previous reports, the usage of anticholinergic
      medications has been associated with an increased risk of dementia with prolonged
      usage or with a high Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB). This study aimed to 
      investigate the association between anticholinergic medications and the risk of
      dementia using data from Taiwan's National Health Research Database (NHIRD).
      Methods: A total of 790,240 patients, with 197,560 patients receiving
      anticholinergic medications and 592,680 control patients (1:3) matched for sex,
      age, and index-year, were enrolled from the two million Longitudinal Health
      Insurance Dataset, a subdataset of the NHIRD, between 2000 and 2015. The
      time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to explore the hazard ratio (HR) 
      with a 95% confidence interval for the association between anticholinergics and
      the risk of dementia during the 15-year follow-up. The behavioral and
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) were recognized by the usage of
      psychotropics. The ACB ranged from zero to three, divided as score <1, 1–1.9,
      2–2.9, 3–4.9,and ≧5. The sensitivity analysis was done by excluding the diagnoses
      of dementia in the first 2 or 4 years after anticholinergic usage. Results: In
      the anticholinergic usage cohort, the HR was 1.043 (95% CI = 0.958-1.212, p =
      0.139) without a significant difference. The sensitivity analysis revealed no
      association between the usage of anticholinergics and the risk of dementia.
      Anticholinergic usage was not associated with BPSD. Male sex, patients of ages of
      60–64 and ≧80, usage of antiparkinsonian medications, a history of Parkinson's
      disease, epilepsy, urinary incontinence, depression, bipolar disorder, and
      psychotic disorder were independent risk factors of dementia. Increased HRs for
      dementia were associated with an ACB ≥ 5 and an anticholinergic usage period ≥
      1,460 days. Conclusion: In this study, the usage of anticholinergics was not
      associated with the risk of dementia or BPSD in a 15-year follow-up study.
      However, patients with the male sex, patients with ages of 65–79 and ≧80,
      patients with some comorbidities, high ACB scores, and long anticholinergic
      treatment duration were associated with the risk of dementia.

TI  - MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA IN A CHILD AFTER MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING: A CASE
      REPORT.
LID - e2018267
AB  - Objective:: To report on a case of malignant hyperthermia in a child after a
      magnetic resonance imaging of the skull was performed using sevoflurane
      anesthesia. Case description:: A 3-year-old boy admitted to the pediatric
      intensive care unit after presenting clinical and laboratory findings consistent 
      with unspecified viral meningoencephalitis. While the patient was sedated, a
      magnetic resonance imaging of the skul was performed using propofol followed by
      the administration of sevoflurane through a laryngeal mask in order to continue
      anesthesia. Approximately three hours after the start of the procedure, the
      patient presented persistent tachycardia, tachypnea, generalized muscular
      stiffness and hyperthermia. With a diagnostic hypothesis of malignant
      hyperthermia, dantrolene was then administered, which immediately induced muscle 
      stiffness, tachycardia, tachypnea and reduced body temperature. Comments::
      Malignant hyperthermia is a rare pharmacogenetic syndrome characterized by a
      severe hypermetabolic reaction after the administration of halogenated
      inhalational anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants such as
      succinylcholine, or both. Although it is a potentially fatal disease, the rapid
      administration of continued doses dantrolene has drastically reduced the
      morbidity and mortality of the disease.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of postoperative analgesia, cardiorespiratory parameters and 
      changes in liver and renal function tests of paracetamol compared to meloxicam
      and carprofen in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.
LID - e0223697
AB  - Background: In veterinary medicine, the administration of nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory analgesics (NSAIDs) for the control of postsurgical pain in
      dogs and cats is common given the anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic
      effects of these drugs. This study compared the serum biochemical changes and
      postoperative analgesic effects of paracetamol, meloxicam, and carprofen in
      bitches submitted to an ovariohysterectomy using the Dynamic Interactive Visual
      Analog Scale (DIVAS) and Pain Scale of the University of Melbourne (UMPS) scoring
      systems. Methods: Thirty bitches of different breeds underwent elective
      ovariohysterectomies and were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups:
      a paracetamol group [15 mg kg-1 intravenous (IV)], a carprofen group (4 mg kg-1
      IV), and a meloxicam group (0.2 mg kg-1 IV). All treatments were administered 30 
      minutes prior to surgery. Paracetamol was administered every 8 hours
      postoperatively for 48 hours total, while carprofen and meloxicam were
      intravenously administered every 24 hours. An evaluation of post-surgical pain
      was done with the DIVAS and the UMPS. The first post-surgical pain measurement
      was performed 1 hour after surgery and then 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and
      48 hours after surgery. Results: All groups exhibited a gradual reduction in pain
      throughout the postoperative period in both scales; however, neither scale
      significantly differed between the three treatment groups (P > 0.05) during the
      48 postoperative hours. Conclusions: Paracetamol was as effective as meloxicam
      and carprofen for post-surgical analgesia in bitches subjected to elective
      ovariohysterectomy. The present study demonstrates that paracetamol may be
      considered a tool for the effective treatment of acute perioperative pain in
      dogs. Furthermore, this drug led to no adverse reactions or changes in the
      parameters assessed in the present study, indicating its safety.

TI  - Clinical Pathways for Oncological Gastrectomy: Are They a Suitable Instrument for
      Process Standardization to Improve Process and Outcome Quality for Patients
      Undergoing Gastrectomy? A Retrospective Cohort Study.
LID - 434
AB  - (1) Background: Oncological gastrectomy requires complex multidisciplinary
      management. Clinical pathways (CPs) can potentially facilitate this task, but
      evidence related to their use in managing oncological gastrectomy is limited.
      This study evaluated the effect of a CP for oncological gastrectomy on process
      and outcome quality. (2) Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing oncological
      gastrectomy before (n = 64) or after (n = 62) the introduction of a CP were
      evaluated. Assessed parameters included catheter and drain management,
      postoperative mobilization, resumption of diet and length of stay. Morbidity,
      mortality, reoperation and readmission rates were used as indicators of outcome
      quality. (3) Results: Enteral nutrition was initiated significantly earlier after
      CP implementation (5.0 vs. 7.0 days, p < 0.0001). Readmission was more frequent
      before CP implementation (7.8% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.05). Incentive spirometer usage
      increased following CP implementation (100% vs. 90.6%, p = 0.11). Mortality,
      morbidity and reoperation rates remained unchanged. (4) Conclusions: After
      implementation of an oncological gastrectomy CP, process quality improved, while 
      indicators of outcome quality such as mortality and reoperation rates remained
      unchanged. CPs are a promising tool to standardize perioperative care for
      oncological gastrectomy.

TI  - Family Planning Practices in Appalachia: Focus Group Perspectives on Service
      Needs in the Context of Regional Substance Abuse.
LID - 1198
AB  - Reproductive health disparities in the Appalachian region may be driven by
      barriers to healthcare access. However, the barriers specific to accessing family
      planning services in Appalachia have not yet been identified from the
      perspectives of Appalachian community members. Moreover, it is unclear how
      community members might perceive elevated levels of opioid use in the region to
      impact family planning practices. To fill this gap in knowledge, the current
      qualitative study explored community perspectives about family planning in
      Appalachia in the context of the opioid epidemic for the purpose of developing a 
      survey instrument based on these responses. We conducted three video call focus
      group interviews with community stakeholders, those who live, work and are
      invested in Appalachia (N = 16), and analyzed the responses using Levesque,
      Harris, and Russell’s (2013) five pillars of healthcare access as a framework to 
      categorize family planning practices and perceptions of service needs in the
      context of regional substance abuse: (1) approachability, (2) acceptability, (3) 
      availability and accommodation, (4) affordability, and (5) appropriateness.
      Subthemes within each of these five categories were also identified. Our findings
      highlight stakeholder concerns around a lack of knowledge about and access to
      family planning services in Appalachia. Community members also expressed concern 
      around the lack of availability of substance use treatment services, which may
      negatively impact family planning use and access in the region.

TI  - Application of Acupuncture to Attenuate Immune Responses and Oxidative Stress in 
      Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction: What Do We Know So Far?
LID - 9641904
AB  - Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common sequela following surgery 
      and hospitalization. The prevention and management of POCD are important during
      clinical practice. POCD more commonly affects elderly patients who have undergone
      major surgery and can result in major decline in quality of life for both
      patients and their families. Acupuncture has been suggested as an effective
      intervention for many neurological disorders. In recent years, there are
      increasing interest in the use of acupuncture to prevent and treat POCD. In this 
      review, we summarized the clinical and preclinical evidence of acupuncture on
      POCD using a narrative approach and discussed the potential mechanisms involved. 
      The experimental details and findings of studies were summarized in tables and
      analyzed. Most of the clinical studies suggested that acupuncture before surgery 
      could reduce the incidence of POCD and reduce the levels of systematic
      inflammatory markers. However, their reliability is limited by methodological
      flaws. Animal studies showed that acupuncture reduced cognitive impairment and
      the associated pathology after various types of surgery. It is possible that
      acupuncture modulates inflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic changes, and other
      cellular events to mitigate POCD. In conclusion, acupuncture is a potential
      intervention for POCD. More clinical studies with good research design are
      required to confirm its effectiveness. At the same time, findings from animal
      studies will help reveal the protective mechanisms, in which systematic
      inflammation is likely to play a major role.

TI  - Quo Vadis PCA? A Review on Current Concepts, Economic Considerations,
      Patient-Related Aspects, and Future Development with respect to
      Patient-Controlled Analgesia.
LID - 9201967
AB  - This review assesses four interrelating aspects of patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA), a long-standing and still widely used concept for postoperative pain
      management. Over the years, anaesthesiologists and patients have appreciated the 
      benefits of PCA alike. The market has seen new technologies leveraging
      noninvasive routes of administration and, thus, further increasing patient and
      staff satisfaction as well as promoting safety aspects. Pharmaceutical research
      focuses on the reduction or avoidance of opioids, side effects, and adverse
      events although influence of these aspects appears to be minor. The importance of
      education is still eminent, and new educational formats are tested to train
      healthcare professionals and patients likewise. New PCA technology can support
      the implementation of efficient processes to reduce workload and human errors;
      however, these new products come with a cost, which is not necessarily reflected 
      through beneficial budget impact or significant improvements in patient outcome. 
      Although first steps have been taken to better recognize the importance of
      postoperative pain management through the introduction of value-based
      reimbursement, in most western countries, PCA is not specifically compensated.
      PCA is still an effective and valued technique for postoperative pain management.
      Although there is identifiable potential for future developments in various
      aspects, this potential has not materialized in new products.

TI  - Factors Affecting Quality of Life and Satisfaction in Patients with Arthritis
      after Change to a Fixed-Dose Naproxen/Esomeprazole Combination Drug.
PG  - 86-93
AB  - Background: In drug therapy for patients with arthritis, a naproxen/esomeprazole 
      combination drug may be a tolerable choice because it can minimize
      gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse effects. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the changes in quality of life (QOL), medication adherence, and
      satisfaction after switch from the existing drug to the combination drug. In
      addition, we analyzed the correlation between the above-mentioned variables and
      the stratified demographic and medical data of the patients. Methods: A
      prospective, noninterventional, observational study was conducted in 30 hospitals
      between May 2014 and July 2016. In total, 2,308 patients with osteoarthritis, 99 
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 76 patients with ankylosing spondylitis
      were enrolled. Demographic information (age, sex, body mass index [BMI], alcohol 
      consumption, and smoking) and medical information (type of arthritis, duration of
      disease, and comorbidities) were collected via a self-administered questionnaire.
      Patients were observed for more than three months after switching to the
      combination drug. Data on the QOL (EuroQoL 5-Dimension questionnaire [EQ-5D
      questionnaire]), medication adherence (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale
      [MMAS]), and satisfaction were collected at the first and last visits. Results: A
      total of 2,483 patients enrolled at 30 hospitals completed the questionnaire.
      After the switch to the combination drug, the mean EQ-5D score improved from 0.72
      ± 0.17 to 0.79 ± 0.14 (p < 0.001), and significant improvement was associated
      with female sex (p = 0.016), shorter disease duration (p < 0.001), and absence of
      comorbidities (p < 0.001). The mean MMAS score was 6.38 ± 1.77, indicating medium
      adherence. Satisfaction was significantly higher in female patients (p < 0.001), 
      in patients with a shorter disease duration (p < 0.001), osteoarthritis (p =
      0.003), and no comorbidities (p < 0.001). Serious drug-related adverse effects
      did not occur. Conclusions: The overall QOL was improved with medium adherence
      after the switch to the combination drug. On the basis of the analysis of
      stratified data, sex, age, drinking, smoking, disease duration, comorbidities,
      and BMI might be associated with QOL, satisfaction, and adherence.

LID - 2150132720905950
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects about 20% of all pregnant women. RLS
      symptoms are usually moderate to severe in intensity during pregnancy and can
      result in insomnia, depression, and other adverse outcomes. Although iron
      deficiency has been implicated as a potential etiological factor, other
      mechanisms can also play a role. Nonpharmacologic methods are the primary
      recommended form of treatment for RLS in pregnancy and lactation. Iron
      supplementation may be considered when the serum ferritin is low; however,
      several patients are unable to tolerate iron or have severe symptoms despite oral
      iron replacement. Here, we describe a case of severe RLS in pregnancy and
      illustrate the dilemmas in diagnosis and management. We review the literature on 
      the prevalence, diagnosis, course, possible underlying pathophysiologic
      mechanisms and complications of RLS in pregnancy. We describe current best
      evidence on the efficacy, and safety of nonpharmacologic therapies, oral and
      intravenous iron supplementation, as well as other medication treatments for RLS 
      in pregnancy and lactation. We highlight gaps in the literature and provide a
      practical guide for the clinical management of RLS in pregnancy and during
      breastfeeding.

TI  - Bench to Bedside: Animal Models of Radiation Induced Musculoskeletal Toxicity.
LID - 427
AB  - Ionizing radiation is a critical aspect of current cancer therapy. While
      classically mature bone was thought to be relatively radio-resistant, more recent
      data have shown this to not be the case. Radiation therapy (RT)-induced bone loss
      leading to fracture is a source of substantial morbidity. The mechanisms of RT
      likely involve multiple pathways, including changes in angiogenesis and bone
      vasculature, osteoblast damage/suppression, and increased osteoclast activity.
      The majority of bone loss appears to occur rapidly after exposure to ionizing RT,
      with significant changes in cortical thickness being detectable on computed
      tomography (CT) within three to four months. Additionally, there is a
      dose–response relationship. Cortical thinning is especially notable in areas of
      bone that receive >40 gray (Gy). Methods to mitigate toxicity due to RT-induced
      bone loss is an area of active investigation. There is an accruing clinical trial
      investigating the use of risderonate, a bisphosphonate, to prevent rib bone loss 
      in patients undergoing lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
      Additionally, several other promising therapeutic/preventative approaches are
      being explored in preclinical studies, including parathyroid hormone (PTH),
      amifostine, and mechanical loading of irradiated bones.

TI  - Nerve Block for Septorhinoplasty: A Retrospective Observational Study of
      Postoperative Complications in 24 Hours.
LID - e6961
AB  - Septorhinoplasty is a surgical procedure that provides functional improvements
      and esthetic adjustments to the appearance of the nose. Pain is a common
      postoperative complication, and pain management is known to decrease
      postoperative complications and total cost. Local anesthetics can
      cost-effectively decrease postoperative pain scores and reduce analgesic
      requirements.The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of
      bilateral facial nerve blocks given with general anesthesia on pain scores and
      the use of postoperative analgesia. The secondary objective was to compare the
      vital signs stability between a group given bilateral facial nerve blocks with
      general anesthesia and a group given general anesthesia only.We conducted a
      retrospective observational study among 40 patients who were divided into two
      groups, each containing 20 patients. The patients in the nerve block (NB) group
      received general anesthesia and bilateral facial blocks of the infraorbital and
      infratrochlear nerves via 5 ml of 0.25% levobupivacaine with 5 ml of diluted
      adrenaline 1:100,000. Patients in the Control group received general anesthesia
      only. Both groups received the same local injection of a mixture of 5 ml of 1%
      lidocaine and 5 ml of 1:100,000 epinephrine at the surgical site, along with the 
      standard general anesthesia. A numerical rating scale, the visual analog scale
      (VAS), was used to evaluate postoperative pain at 15, 30, and 45 minutes
      postoperatively, and the stability of the vital signs was also assessed.The
      results showed that using bilateral infraorbital and infratrochlear nerve block
      injection with 0.25% levobupivacaine for patients who underwent septorhinoplasty 
      under general anesthesia provided greater stability of vital signs but had no
      effect on the pain score or analgesia need. Further assessment should be
      performed in a larger number of patients to either confirm or refute these
      results. Additional studies could be conducted in several hospitals within the
      Kingdom to determine how broadly applicable nerve blockade is in reducing pain
      sensation.

AB  - Introduction: Throughout the world, indigenous peoples share traumatic colonial
      experiences that have caused gross inequalities for them and continue to impact
      every aspect of their lives. The effect of intergenerational trauma and other
      health disparities have been remarkable for Indigenous children and adolescents, 
      who are at a greater risk of adverse mental health and addiction outcomes
      compared with non-indigenous people of the same age. Most indigenous children are
      exposed to addictive substances at an early age, which often leads to early
      initiation of substance use and is associated with subsequent physical and mental
      health issues, poor social and relational functioning, and occupational and legal
      problems. The aim of this paper is to report the protocol for the scoping review 
      of school-based interventions for substance use prevention in Indigenous children
      ages 7–13 living in Canada, the USA, Australia and New Zealand. This scoping
      review seeks to answer the following questions: (1) What is known about
      indigenous school-based interventions for preventing substance use and (2) What
      are the characteristics and outcomes of school-based interventions for preventing
      substance use? Methods and analysis: This scoping review will use steps described
      by Arksey and O’Malley and Levac: (1) identifying the research question(s); (2)
      identifying relevant studies; (3) selecting the studies; (4) charting the data;
      (5) collating, summarising and reporting the results and (6) consulting with
      experts. Our findings will be reported according to the guidelines set by the
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
      Scoping Reviews. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics review approval is not required
      for this project. Findings from this study will be presented to lay public, at
      scientific conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

TI  - Effects of Topical Hangeshashinto (TJ-14) on Chemotherapy-Induced Oral Mucositis.
PG  - 1069-78
AB  - Purpose: Hangeshashinto (TJ-14), a Kampo medicine comprising seven types of
      herbs, has been used in Japan to alleviate the side effects associated with
      anticancer drug treatments. However, the pharmacological effects of this medicine
      currently remain unclear. The present study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of 
      TJ-14 against anticancer drug-induced stomatitis, the pain associated with which 
      may have a negative impact on mastication and swallowing. Methods: Mucositis was 
      induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by cancer chemotherapy. Changes in body weight,
      stomatitis grades, histopathological scores, and oral bacterial counts were
      examined among TJ-14-treated, saline-treated, and Control (no treatment) rats. In
      vitro studies, including cell proliferation and wound healing assays, using
      epidermal keratinocyte and fibroblast cell lines were conducted. Results: The
      local application of TJ-14 exerted strong antibacterial effects and attenuated
      oral chemotherapy-induced stomatitis in rats. TJ-14 also increased the viability 
      and invasion of epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Conclusion: The present 
      results demonstrated the potential of TJ-14 to attenuate chemotherapy-induced
      stomatitis.

TI  - Chronic Non-cancer Pain Management and Addiction: A Review.
LID - e6963
AB  - The use of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) has been a fast-rising
      treatment phenomenon in the last two decades. Though opioids are advocated in
      various chronic pain management guidelines, their use in chronic non-cancer pain 
      still remains controversial as evidence of this approach is still weak. This
      paper highlights potential adverse effects associated with opioid use in pain
      management, including an increase in tolerance, dependence, and addiction
      outcomes. Nonetheless, opioids have an important place in contemporary CNCP
      management for selected patients. However, pain management must involve regular
      monitoring and the use of a multimodal pain management strategy. It is essential 
      that the treating physician must be up-to-date with the form of therapy so that
      they have the requisite confidence to prescribe opioids and effectively manage
      adverse effects. Moreover, the adverse effects should be treated promptly to
      enhance patient compliance. Since this approach is beneficial for some patients, 
      opioid treatment should only be applied on a case by case basis.

TI  - Prescription drug diversion, misuse, and abuse among people living with HIV: a
      scoping review protocol.
LID - 29
AB  - Background: Prescription drugs are controlled medicines due to their potential
      risks of being diverted, misused, and abused. Since the introduction of
      antiretroviral (ARVs) drugs, HIV is currently regarded as a chronic condition.
      However, prescription drug diversion, misuse, and abuse might serve as one of the
      critical barriers for achieving optimal medication adherence among people living 
      with HIV, thereby negatively impacting the HIV care mandate. The primary aim of
      this scoping review is to gather evidence on the prevalence, practices, risk
      factors, and motives associated with prescription drug diversion, misuse, and
      abuse, as well as the evidence on the association between prescription drug
      diversion, misuse, and abuse with antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence.
      Methods: This review will be guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s framework as well as
      recommendations by Levac et al. (Implement Sci 5:69, 2010). We will search the
      following databases for relevant literature meeting our eligibility criteria:
      PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCOhost (Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, and
      Newspaper Source), World Health Organization, Science Direct, and Open Access
      Theses and Dissertations. Studies published within the period of January 1996 to 
      June 2019 are eligible. The included studies should report evidence on the
      prevalence, practices, risk factors, motives, or association between ART
      adherence and prescription drug diversion, misuse, and abuse. Thematic analysis
      will be applied to summarize the review findings. Discussion: We anticipate
      finding a considerable number of research studies on prescription drug diversion,
      misuse, and abuse among people living with HIV. Our synthesis of this evidence
      base is intended to serve as guidance for future research studies. The study
      findings will be disseminated through the traditional academic platforms, such as
      peer-reviewed publications and presentations at relevant local and international 
      conferences, symposiums, and seminars. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO

TI  - Pregabalin Abuse in Combination With Other Drugs: Monitoring Among Methadone
      Patients.
LID - 1022
AB  - Introduction: In recent years, there has been an increase in the non-medical use 
      of psychoactive prescription drugs including pregabalin (PGB). Studies have shown
      that multiple drug users and patients in methadone treatment programs
      administered PGB at high dosages in order to achieve euphoria, reduce withdrawal 
      symptoms, or potentiate the effects of methadone. For these reasons, accurate
      toxicological monitoring is required for these high-risk individuals. Materials
      and Methods: The present study investigated whether PGB could be detected in the 
      hair samples of 250 patients with a history of opiate dependency, and under
      toxicological surveillance assess their compliance with methadone maintenance
      therapy. Results: Opiates were found in 54/250 of all hair samples, while
      cannabis was present in 74/250 patients, cocaine was detected in 21/250 patients,
      and benzodiazepines without prescription were identified in 49/250 patients. As
      expected, methadone was present in all 250 patients (100%). PGB without
      prescription was found in the hair samples of 35/250 patients (14%). Of these,
      91.43% were male, 48.57% were <30 y old, and 45.71% were between ages 30 and 50
      y. There were no apparent associations among PGB use, daily methadone dosage, and
      duration of methadone maintenance therapy. Psychiatric comorbidities were present
      in 25.71% of the patients abusing PGB. Anxiety (55.56%) and depression (33.33%)
      were the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. Discussion: Most of the patients
      taking PGB (57.14%) used other drugs (especially opiates) concurrently. The
      utility of hair analysis is explained by easy and rapid sample collection and the
      ability of the hair to reflect long-term drug use and incorporate drug
      metabolites. The findings of this study suggested that PGB has significant
      potential for abuse by high-risk populations such as opioid users and patients
      with dual diagnosis. These risks are particularly high in cases of poly-drug use 
      and drug intake that are not in compliance with prescription guidelines.

TI  - Protocol for a multi-centre, definitive randomised controlled trial of the
      effectiveness of Individual Placement and Support for employment support among
      people with alcohol and drug dependence.
LID - 167
AB  - Background: Unemployment is highly prevalent in populations with alcohol and drug
      dependence and the employment support offered in addiction-treatment programmes
      is ineffective. Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based
      intervention for competitive employment. IPS has been extensively studied in
      severe mental illness and physical disabilities, but there have been no formal
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in alcohol and drug dependence. The
      Individual Placement and Support for Alcohol and Drug Dependence (IPS-AD) study
      should determine whether IPS for patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), opioid
      use disorder (OUD) and other drug use disorder is effective. Design/methods: The 
      IPS-AD study is a seven-site, pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, superiority
      RCT. IPS-AD includes a realist process evaluation. Eligible patients (adult,
      unemployed or economically inactive for at least 6 months and wishing to obtain
      open job market employment and enrolled in ongoing community treatment-as-usual
      (TAU; the control condition) in England for AUD, OUD and other drug use
      disorders) will be randomised (1:1) to receive TAU and any standard employment
      support, or TAU plus IPS (the experimental condition) for 9 months with up to 4
      months of in-work support. The primary outcome measure will be competitive
      employment status (at least 1 day (7 h)) during an 18-month follow-up, determined
      by patient-level, trial-data-linkage with national tax and state benefit
      databases. From meta-analysis, an 18% target difference on this measure of
      vocational effectiveness (for the experimental intervention) and a two-sided 5%
      level of statistical significance, will require a minimum target sample of 832
      participants to achieve 90% power for a pre-registered, mixed-effects,
      multi-variable logistic regression model. A maximum-likelihood
      multiple-imputation approach will manage missing outcome data. IPS-AD has six
      vocational secondary outcome measures during the 18-month follow-up: (1) total
      time in competitive employment (and corresponding National Insurance
      contributions and tax paid); (2) time from randomisation to first competitive
      employment; (3) number of competitive job appointments; (4) job tenure (length of
      longest held competitive employment); (5) sustained employment (tenure in a
      single appointment for at least 13 weeks); and (6) job search self-efficacy. A
      primary cost-benefit analysis and a secondary cost-effectiveness analysis will be
      done using the primary outcome and secondary vocational outcomes, respectively
      and will include addiction treatment and social and health outcomes and their
      associated reference costs. The process evaluation will address IPS
      implementation and delivery. Discussion: The IPS-AD study is the first
      large-scale, multi-site, definitive, superiority RCT of IPS for people with
      alcohol and drug dependence. Findings from the study will have substantial
      implications for service delivery. Trial registration: ISRCTN Registry, ID:
      ISRCTN24159790. Registered on 1 February 2018.

TI  - Different doses of galcanezumab versus placebo in patients with migraine and
      cluster headache: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 14
AB  - Background: Galcanezumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that target to calcitonin
      gene-related peptide (CGRP). It has been tested for the preventive treatment of
      migraine and episodic cluster headache by multiple randomized clinical trials
      (RCTs) and have been found to reduce headache frequency. Methods: We
      systematically searched PubMed and Embase on Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from the earliest date to August 1, 2019. Relative
      risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) were used to evaluate clinical
      outcomes. Results: Seven studies were pooled with 3889 patients. Subcutaneous
      injection of Galcanezumab at 120 mg, 240 mg leads to a statistically significant 
      response rate for the treatment of migraine compared with placebo (120 mg:
      RR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.33 to 1.70; P < 0.001; 240 mg: RR = 1.58; 95% CI, 1.43 to
      1.76; P < 0.001). Among them, 120 mg group has the same treatment efficacy with
      240 mg group (50% response: RR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.22; P = 0.425; 75%
      response: RR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.23; P = 0.301; 100% response; RR = 1.06;
      95% CI, 0.81 to 1.37; P = 0.682; MHD: RR = − 0.08; 95% CI, − 0.55 to − 0.40;
      P = 0.748) while related to a lower risk for adverse events for the treatment of 
      migraine (120 mg RR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.14; P = 0.084; 240 mg: RR = 1.17;
      95% CI, 1.09 to 1.25; P < 0.001). 300 mg per month galcanezumab is effective for 
      the prevention of episodic cluster headache measured by at least 50% reduction of
      cluster headache frequency at week 3 (RR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00–1.84; P = 0.048).
      Conclusions: Use of galcanezumab is related to a significantly reduced monthly
      headache frequency compared with placebo for the treatment of migraine and
      episodic cluster headache, 120 mg has the same treatment efficacy with 240 mg
      group while related to a lower risk for adverse effects for the treatment of
      migraine. 300 mg per month galcanezumab is effective for the prevention of
      episodic cluster headache with no significantly increased adverse events.

TI  - Impact of bottle size on in-home consumption of wine: feasibility and
      acceptability randomised cross-over study.
LID - 19
AB  - Background: Reducing alcohol consumption across populations would prevent many
      non-communicable diseases. Large packages increase food and non-alcoholic drink
      consumption and large glasses increase wine consumption. Smaller bottles may
      reduce alcohol consumption but their impact is uncertain. This study aims to (i) 
      explore the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a large-scale randomised 
      study to assess the impact of bottle size on in-home wine consumption and (ii)
      estimate the effect size and variance of the intervention on consumption to
      inform the design of future studies. Methods: Cross-over randomised study in
      which 16 households in Cambridge, England, consuming at least two 750-ml bottles 
      of wine each week, received a pre-set volume of wine biweekly for 4 weeks, in
      750-ml and 375-ml bottles, in random order. Consumption was assessed by recording
      the number of empty and partially full bottles at the end of each biweekly
      period. At the end of the study, household representatives were interviewed about
      their experiences of participating in the study. Results: The study procedures
      proved feasible. Comparable to similar trials, 14% of identified eligible
      households (18/125) consented to participate in the study. Attrition between
      consent and study completion was 11% (2/18) and 0% between study periods and 13% 
      of households (2/16) correctly identified the study aim. The study procedures
      were considered acceptable. After adjusting for guest and out-of-home
      consumption, the difference in consumption between the 750-ml (3385.2 ml;
      SD = 1698.5) and 375-ml bottles (3376.7 ml; SD = 1719.0) was 8.4 ml (SD = 1235.4;
      95%CI − 596.9, 613.8). Results suggest a possible order effect, with households
      receiving the 375-ml bottles first consuming more wine out of the 750-ml bottles 
      and vice versa. This might also reflect an increase in consumption with study
      duration. Households receiving the 375-ml bottles first (6315.9 ml; SD = 3293.5) 
      also drank less wine overall than those receiving the 750-ml bottles first
      (7335.4 ml; SD = 3735.4). Discussion: The findings support the feasibility and
      acceptability of running a large-scale randomised study to assess the impact of
      bottle size on in-home wine consumption. Due to the heterogeneous patterning of
      results, a future study will be powered using the variance observed in the
      current study to detect a meaningful reduction of 250 ml of wine when consumed
      from smaller compared with larger bottles. Trial registration: Open Science
      Framework (OSF): rmk43; May 23, 2017.

PG  - 65-8
AB  - Introduction: Streptococcus pneumoniae endocarditis (SPE) occurs in <3% of all EI
      cases due to the evolution of penicillin and vaccination. However,
      immunocompromised and unvaccinated patients are still at grave risk.Case: A
      58-year-old African American male who used alcohol and intravenous (IV) drugs
      presented with confusion, fever, and hemoptysis. He had coarse rhonchi with a
      grade 2/5 holosystolic apical murmur. CT chest showed diffuse bilateral
      infiltrates. Blood cultures were positive for pansensitive Streptococcus
      pneumoniae. Echocardiogram demonstrated large vegetations on the anterior and
      posterior leaflets of the mitral valve with flail leaflet and severe eccentric
      mitral regurgitation. Patient was started on IV ceftriaxone, but after 3 weeks of
      therapy, he wished to leave against medical advice. He was discharged on
      combination oral therapy with successful resolution of SPE on
      follow-up.Discussion: Invasive pneumococcus is highly virulent causing
      irreversible valvular destruction or death.IV beta-lactams are first-line
      treatment, but there are currently no guideline-recommended alternatives for oral
      therapy. Recent data suggest partial oral therapy may be noninferior to IV only
      therapy.Conclusion: Switching to oral combination antibiotics after at least 2
      weeks of IV therapy is an acceptable alternative to treat SPE.

TI  - Anesthetic Strategies in Oncological Surgery: Not Only a Simple Sleep, but Also
      Impact on Immunosuppression and Cancer Recurrence.
PG  - 931-40
AB  - Tumor recurrences or metastases remain a major hurdle in improving overall cancer
      survival. In the perioperative period, the balance between the ability of the
      cancer to seed and grow at the metastatic site and the ability of the patient to 
      fight against the tumor (i.e. the host antitumor immunity) may determine the
      development of clinically evident metastases and influence the patient outcome.
      Up to 80% of oncological patients receive anesthesia and/or analgesia for
      diagnostic, therapeutic or palliative interventions. Therefore, anesthesiologists
      are asked to administer drugs such as opiates and volatile or intravenous
      anesthetics, which may determine different effects on immunomodulation and cancer
      recurrence. For instance, some studies suggest that intravenous drugs, such as
      propofol, may inhibit the host immunity to a lower extent as compared to volatile
      anesthetics. Similarly, some studies suggest that analgesia assured by local
      anesthetics may provide a reduction of cancer recurrence rate; whilst on the
      opposite side, opioids may exert negative consequences in patients undergoing
      cancer surgery, by interacting with the immune system response via the modulation
      of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system, or
      directly through the opioid receptors on the surface of immune cells. In this
      review, we summarize the main findings on the effects induced by different drugs 
      on immunomodulation and cancer recurrence.

TI  - Risk factors for pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations in long-term care
      facility residents: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 47
AB  - Background: Older adults who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at
      particularly high risk for infection, morbidity and mortality from pneumonia and 
      influenza (P&I) compared to individuals of younger age and those living outside
      institutional settings. The risk factors for P&I hospitalizations that are
      specific to LTCFs remain poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the
      incidence of P&I hospitalization and associated person- and facility-level
      factors among post-acute (short-stay) and long-term (long-stay) care residents
      residing in LTCFs from 2013 to 2015. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study,
      we used Medicare administrative claims linked to Minimum Data Set and LTCF-level 
      data to identify short-stay (< 100 days, index = admission date) and long-stay
      (100+ days, index = day 100) residents who were followed from the index date
      until the first of hospitalization, LTCF discharge, Medicare disenrollment, or
      death. We measured incidence rates (IRs) for P&I hospitalization per 100,000
      person-days, and estimated associations with baseline demographics, geriatric
      syndromes, clinical characteristics, and medication use using Cox regression
      models. Results: We analyzed data from 1,118,054 short-stay and 593,443 long-stay
      residents. The crude 30-day IRs (95% CI) of hospitalizations with P&I in the
      principal position were 26.0 (25.4, 26.6) and 34.5 (33.6, 35.4) among short- and 
      long-stay residents, respectively. The variables associated with P&I varied
      between short and long-stay residents, and common risk factors included: advanced
      age (85+ years), admission from an acute hospital, select cardiovascular and
      respiratory conditions, impaired functional status, and receipt of antibiotics or
      Beers criteria medications. Facility staffing and care quality measures were
      important risk factors among long-stay residents but not in short-stay residents.
      Conclusions: Short-stay residents had lower crude 30- and 90-day incidence rates 
      of P&I hospitalizations than long-stay LTCF residents. Differences in risk
      factors for P&I between short- and long-stay populations suggest the importance
      of considering distinct profiles of post-acute and long-term care residents in
      infection prevention and control strategies in LTCFs. These findings can help
      clinicians target interventions to subgroups of LTCF residents at highest P&I
      risk.

TI  - Intubation in acute alcohol intoxications at the emergency department.
LID - 11
AB  - Background: Guidelines recommend endotracheal intubation in trauma patients with 
      a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) < 9 because of the loss of airway reflexes and
      consequential risk of airway obstruction. However, in patients with acute alcohol
      intoxication guidelines are not clear. Thus, we aimed to determine the
      proportional incidence of intubation in alcohol intoxication and compare the
      clinical characteristics of intubated and non-intubated patients, as well as
      reasons for intubation in all patients and in the subgroup of patients with
      reduced GCS (< 9) but without traumatic brain injury. Methods: We performed a
      retrospective analysis of all consultations to an urban ED in Switzerland that
      presented with an acute alcohol intoxication between 1st June 2012 and 31th Mai
      2017. Patient and emergency consultations’ characteristics, related injuries,
      intubation and reason for intubations were extracted. As a subgroup analysis, we 
      analysed the patients with a GCS < 9 without a traumatic brain injury. Results:
      Of 3003 consultations included from 01.06.2012 to 31.05.2017, 68 were intubated, 
      leading to a proportional incidence of 2.3% intubations in alcohol-intoxication. 
      Intubated patients had a lower blood alcohol concentration (1.3 g/kg [IQR
      1.0–2.2] vs. 1.6 g/kg [IQR1.1–2.2], p = 0.034) and less often suffered from
      chronic alcohol abuse (1183 [39.4%] patients vs. 14 [20.6%], p = 0.001) than
      non-intubated patients. Patients with trauma were intubated more often (33
      patients [48.5%] vs. 742 [25.3%], p < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, 110/145
      patients (74.3%) were not intubated; again, more intubated patients had a history
      of trauma (9 patients [25.7%] vs. 10 [9.1%], p = 0.011). Conclusions: Intubation 
      in alcohol-intoxicated patients is rare and, among intoxicated patients with GCS 
      < 9, more than two thirds were not intubated in our study - without severe
      complications. Trauma in general, independent of the history of a traumatic brain
      injury, and a missing history of chronic alcohol abuse are associated with
      intubation, but not with blood alcohol concentration. Special caution is required
      for intoxicated patients with trauma or other additional intoxications or
      diseases.

TI  - Combination of post-fascia iliaca compartment block and dexmedetomidine in pain
      and inflammation control after total hip arthroplasty for elder patients: a
      randomized control study.
LID - 42
AB  - Objective: This study aims to investigate the efficiency of fascia iliaca
      compartment block (FICB) combined with dexmedetomidine (DEX) in postoperative and
      inflammation management for elder patients after total hip arthroplasty. Methods:
      The present randomized controlled study included a total of 119 elder patients
      who received total hip arthroplasty in our hospital from March 2016 to December
      2018. These patients were divided into three groups: control group, patients
      received routine general anesthesia; FICB group, patients received additional
      FICB after surgery; and combined group, patients received both pre-treatment of
      DEX and post-treatment of fascia iliaca compartment block. The serum levels of
      interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by ELISA.
      The visual analog scale (VAS) score was measured at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after
      surgery, and the patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) pressing time
      within 48 h after surgery was also recorded. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index
      (PSQI) was used to measure the sleep quality before and at 1 month after surgery.
      Results: The VAS scores were significantly lower in patients in the combined
      group, when compared with the other two groups, at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after
      surgery. In addition, the VAS scores at all time points were significantly lower 
      in the FICB group than the control group. The PCIA pressing times were also
      remarkably lower in the combined group. At 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery, the
      serum levels of these inflammatory factors were the lowest in the combined group,
      and the PSQI scores were significantly lower in the combined group, when compared
      with the other two groups, while the control group had the highest PSQI scores
      among the three groups. There was no severe side effects and significant
      difference observed. Conclusion: FICB combined with DEX reduced the postoperative
      pain, improved the sleep condition, and decreased the serum levels of
      inflammatory factors after total hip arthroplasty.

TI  - Birds Drinking Alcohol: Species and Relationship with People. A Review of
      Information from Scientific Literature and Social Media.
LID - 270
AB  - Simple Summary: Alcohol consumption is quite common in the bird world. Using
      scientific literature and Internet resources (available because of the rising
      popularity of social media), we investigate which species and sources of ethanol 
      are most frequently used by captive and wild birds. Moreover, it was possible
      with the internet videos to discriminate between intentional and unintentional
      ingestion. This information may be helpful in choosing appropriate species for
      future laboratory studies about ethanol metabolism in birds and their behaviour. 
      Abstract: Ethanol is a natural by-product of the fermentation process of fruit
      sugars and is occasionally consumed by fruit-eating and tree sap drinking birds. 
      Information on this form of alcohol consumption features in the scientific
      literature. However, as pets or as wild animals living close to humans in urban
      habitats, birds have increasing possibilities to consume alcohol from beverages, 
      such as beer, wine or spirits. Some observations have been discussed in a
      light-hearted manner in mass media and social media, but without any
      generalization of why some bird species drink the beverages intentionally or
      unintentionally provided by humans. To check which species and in what
      circumstances birds drink alcohol and how this is evaluated by humans, we
      reviewed the scientific literature and analysed videos from YouTube. In total we 
      found and analysed 8 scientific papers and 179 YouTube videos, from which we
      identified at least 55 species (in some cases not all birds were identified to
      species level), 11 in the scientific literature and 47 in videos. The
      distribution of these species over the avian phylogenetic tree suggests that the 
      origin of this convergent behaviour is mainly by human influence. The two data
      sources differed in the species covered. Videos typically presented interactions 
      of birds with human-provided alcoholic beverages, and were dominated by two
      groups of intelligent birds: parrots and corvids. The popularity of YouTube
      videos for a particular species was positively correlated with the general
      popularity of the species as measured by the number of hits (results listed) on
      Google. Human responses to the videos were generally very positive and we
      analysed how the responses were influenced by factors derived from viewing the
      videos. Moreover, YouTube videos also provide information on at least 47 new bird
      species not previously mentioned as using alcohol, and our results suggest that
      parrots in particular can be potentially good candidates for future restricted
      laboratory studies on the effect of ethanol on birds and their relationship with 
      humans.

TI  - Matched pilot study examining cannabis-based dronabinol for acute pain following 
      traumatic injury.
LID - e000391
AB  - Background: To determine whether adjunctive dronabinol, a licensed form of
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, reduces opioid consumption when used off-label for 
      managing acute pain following traumatic injury. Methods: This matched cohort
      study included patients who were admitted with a traumatic injury between 1 March
      2017 and 30 October 2017. The hospital pharmacy database was used to identify
      patients who received dronabinol (cases), and they were matched 1:1 to patients
      who did not receive dronabinol (controls) using age, cause of injury and hospital
      length of stay. The primary outcome, change in opioid consumption, was calculated
      using morphine milligram equivalents (MME). The change in MME was calculated for 
      cases as total MME over 48 hours with adjunctive dronabinol minus 48 hours prior 
      to dronabinol, and for controls as total MME 48–96 hours from admission minus
      0–48 hours from admission. Data are presented as mean and SE or median and IQR.
      Statistical analysis was performed using paired t-tests and McNemar’s tests.
      Results: There were 66 patients included: 33 cases and 33 matched controls.
      Dronabinol was initiated 55 (28–107) hours from admission. Cases and controls
      were well matched. Cases had a significant reduction in opioid consumption with
      adjunctive dronabinol (−79 (20) MME, p<0.001), while opioid consumption was
      unchanged for controls (−9 (20) MME, p=0.63). This resulted in a ninefold greater
      reduction in opioid consumption for cases versus controls that was statistically 
      different between pairs (p=0.02). Nineteen (58%) cases reported using marijuana; 
      in this subset, opioid consumption was reduced with adjunctive dronabinol (−97
      (24) MME, p<0.001) versus a non-significant increase in opioid consumption in
      matched controls (11 (29) MME, p=0.70); difference between groups, p=0.01.
      Conclusions: The results of this study suggest adjunctive dronabinol reduces
      opioid consumption following traumatic injury. The opioid-sparing effect of
      dronabinol may be greater in patients who are marijuana users. Level of evidence:
      III.

TI  - Genotoxic Properties of Synthetic Cannabinoids on TK6 Human Cells by Flow
      Cytometry.
LID - 1150
AB  - Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS) include several classes of substances such as
      synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs), an emerging alternative to marijuana, easily
      purchasable on internet. SCBs are more dangerous than Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol as 
      a consequence of their stronger affinities for the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which
      may result in longer duration of distinct effects, greater potency, and toxicity.
      The information on SCBs cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and long-term
      effects is scarce. This fact suggests the urgent need to increase available data 
      and to investigate if some SCBs have an impact on the stability of genetic
      material. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the evaluation of the
      mutagenic effect of different SCBs belonging to indole- and indazole-structures. 
      The analyzes were conducted in vitro on human TK6 cells and mutagenicity were
      measured as micronucleus fold increase by flow cytometry. Our results have
      highlighted, for the first time, the mutagenic capacity of four SCBs, in
      particular in terms of chromosomal damage induction. We underline the serious
      potential toxicity of SCBs that suggests the need to proceed with the studies of 
      other different synthetic compounds. Moreover, we identified a method that allows
      a rapid but effective screening of NPS placed on the market increasingly faster.

TI  - The Role of Dietary Antioxidants in the Pathogenesis of Neurodegenerative
      Diseases and Their Impact on Cerebral Oxidoreductive Balance.
LID - 435
AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are progressive diseases of the nervous system that
      lead to neuron loss or functional disorders. Neurodegenerative diseases require
      long-term, sometimes life-long pharmacological treatment, which increases the
      risk of adverse effects and a negative impact of pharmaceuticals on the patients’
      general condition. One of the main problems related to the treatment of this type
      of condition is the limited ability to deliver drugs to the brain due to their
      poor solubility, low bioavailability, and the effects of the blood-brain barrier.
      Given the above, one of the main objectives of contemporary scientific research
      focuses on the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. As disorders related to 
      the competence of the antioxidative system are a marker in all diseases of this
      type, the primary prophylactics should entail the use of exogenous antioxidants, 
      particularly ones that can be used over extended periods, regardless of the
      patient’s age, and that are easily available, e.g., as part of a diet or as diet 
      supplements. The paper analyzes the significance of the oxidoreductive balance in
      the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Based on information published
      globally in the last 10 years, an analysis is also provided with regard to the
      impact of exogenous antioxidants on brain functions with respect to the
      prevention of this type of diseases.

      undertaken and new standardised formulations and guidelines were developed.
      Results: Five existing preterm Amino acid-Dextrose formulations have been
      modified and two new concentrated Amino acid-Dextrose formulations added to
      optimise amino acid and nutrient intake according to gestation. Organic phosphate
      has replaced inorganic phosphate allowing for an increase in calcium and
      phosphate content, and acetate reduced. Lipid emulsions are unchanged, with both 
      SMOFlipid (Fresenius Kabi, Australia) and ClinOleic (Baxter Healthcare,
      Australia) preparations included. The physicochemical compatibility and stability
      of all formulations have been tested and confirmed. Guidelines to standardise the
      parenteral nutrition clinical practice across facilities have also been
      developed. Conclusions: The 2017 PN formulations and guidelines developed by the 
      2017 Neonatal Parenteral Nutrition Consensus Group offer concise and practical
      instructions to clinicians on how to implement current and up-to-date evidence
      based PN to the NICU population.

TI  - Early Neonatal Pain—A Review of Clinical and Experimental Implications on Painful
      Conditions Later in Life.
LID - 30
AB  - Modern health care has brought our society innumerable benefits but has also
      introduced the experience of pain very early in life. For example, it is now
      routine care for newborns to receive various injections or have blood drawn
      within 24 h of life. For infants who are sick or premature, the pain experiences 
      inherent in the required medical care are frequent and often severe, with
      neonates requiring intensive care admission encountering approximately fourteen
      painful procedures daily in the hospital. Given that much of the world has seen a
      steady increase in preterm births for the last several decades, an ever-growing
      number of babies experience multiple painful events before even leaving the
      hospital. These noxious events occur during a critical period of neurodevelopment
      when the nervous system is very vulnerable due to immaturity and neuroplasticity.
      Here, we provide a narrative review of the literature pertaining to the idea that
      early life pain has significant long-term effects on neurosensory, cognition,
      behavior, pain processing, and health outcomes that persist into childhood and
      even adulthood. We refer to clinical and pre-clinical studies investigating how
      early life pain impacts acute pain later in life, focusing on animal model
      correlates that have been used to better understand this relationship. Current
      knowledge around the proposed underlying mechanisms responsible for the
      long-lasting consequences of neonatal pain, its neurobiological and behavioral
      effects, and its influence on later pain states are discussed. We conclude by
      highlighting that another important consequence of early life pain may be the
      impact it has on later chronic pain states—an area of research that has received 
      little attention.

TI  - The Antiallodynic Effect of Nefopam on Vincristine-Induced Neuropathy in Mice.
PG  - 323-9
AB  - Background: Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is a disabling condition
      following cancer treatment. Vincristine has more neurotoxicity than other vinca
      alkaloid agents. This study evaluated the correlation of different doses of
      nefopam with antiallodynic effects in a mouse vincristine neuropathy model.
      Methods: A peripheral neuropathic mouse model was made by intraperitoneal
      injection of vincristine (0.1 mg/kg/day; 5-day-on, 2-day-off schedule over 12
      days). After the development of allodynia, mice were injected intraperitoneally
      with 0.9% normal saline (NS group) or various doses (10, 30, 60 mg/kg) of nefopam
      (Nefopam group). We examined allodynia using von Frey hairs pre-administration
      and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 mins, and 24 hrs after drug administration. We
      also measured the neurokinin-1 receptor concentrations in the spinal cord to
      confirm the antiallodynic effect of nefopam after drug administration. Results:
      The peripheral neuropathic mouse model showed prominent mechanical allodynia.
      Intraperitoneal nefopam produced a clear dose-dependent increase in paw
      withdrawal threshold compared with pre-administration values and versus the NS
      group. The concentration of neurokinin-1 receptor was significantly decreased in 
      the Nefopam group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Intraperitoneally administered nefopam
      yielded a dose-dependent attenuation of mechanical allodynia and decreased
      neurokinin-1 receptor concentration, suggesting that the neurokinin-1 receptor is
      involved in the antiallodynic effects of nefopam in vincristine neuropathy.

TI  - Early prediction of extubation failure in patients with severe pneumonia: a
      retrospective cohort study.
LID - BSR20192435
AB  - Backgroud: Severe pneumonia is one of the most common causes for mechanical
      ventilation. We aimed to early identify severe pneumonia patients with high risk 
      of extubation failure in order to improve prognosis.Methods: From April 2014 to
      December 2015, medical records of intubated patients with severe pneumonia in
      intensive care unit were retrieved from database. Patients were divided into
      extubation success and failure groups, and multivariate logistic regressions were
      performed to identify independent predictors for extubation failure.Results: A
      total of 125 eligible patients were included, of which 82 and 43 patients had
      extubation success and failure, respectively. APACHE II score (odds ratio (OR)
      1.141, 95% confident interval (CI) 1.022–1.273, P = 0.019, cutoff at 17.5), blood
      glucose (OR 1.122, 95%CI 1.008–1.249, P = 0.035, cutoff at 9.87 mmol/l), dose of 
      fentanyl (OR 3.010, 95%CI 1.100–8.237, P = 0.032, cutoff at 1.135 mg/d), and the 
      need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (OR 2.774, 95%CI 1.062–7.252, P =
      0.037) were independent risk factors for extubation failure.Conclusion: In
      patients with severe pneumonia, APACHE II score > 17.5, blood glucose > 9.87
      mmol/l, fentanyl usage > 1.135 mg/d, and the need for RBC transfusion might be
      associated with higher risk of extubation failure.

TI  - Buprenorphine to reverse respiratory depression from methadone overdose in
      opioid-dependent patients: a prospective randomized trial.
LID - 44
AB  - Background: Naloxone is the usual drug used in opioid-induced respiratory
      depression but it has a short half-life, precipitates withdrawal in dependent
      patients, and thus for persistent reversal of long-acting opioids has to be given
      by titrated doses and infusions. The partial agonist buprenorphine has a much
      longer duration of action and causes less severe withdrawal, but still should
      largely reverse respiratory depression induced by full agonist opioids. We aimed 
      to compare the efficacy/safety of buprenorphine and naloxone in reversing
      respiratory depression in methadone-poisoned opioid-dependent patients. Methods: 
      Patients with methadone-induced respiratory depression were randomized to receive
      naloxone (titrated doses), or lower or higher doses of buprenorphine (10 μg/kg or
      15 μg/kg). The primary outcome was immediate reversal of respiratory depression. 
      We also recorded acute opioid withdrawal, need for intubation/recurrent apnea,
      repeated doses of opioid antagonists, length of hospital stay, other morbidity,
      and mortality. The study was registered with the Iranian Registry of Clinical
      Trials (Trial ID: 18265; Approval code: IRCT2015011020624N1). Results:
      Eighty-five patients were randomized; 55/56 patients who received buprenorphine
      had rapid reversal of respiratory depression, which persisted for at least 12 h. 
      Naloxone was effective in 28/29 patients, but often required very high titrated
      doses (thus delaying time to respond) and prolonged infusions. Intubation (8/29
      vs 5/56) and opioid withdrawal (15/29 vs 7/56) were less common with
      buprenorphine. There were no serious complications or deaths in those receiving
      buprenorphine. The 15-μg/kg buprenorphine dose appeared to provide a longer
      duration of action, but precipitated withdrawal more frequently than the 10-μg/kg
      dose. Conclusion: Buprenorphine appears to be a safe and effective substitute for
      naloxone in overdosed opioid-dependent patients. Further studies are warranted to
      explore the optimal dosing strategy for buprenorphine to consistently maintain
      reversal of respiratory depression but not precipitate withdrawal. Trial

TI  - Protocol for a multi-site study of the effects of overdose prevention education
      with naloxone distribution program in Skåne County, Sweden.
LID - 49
AB  - Background: Continuously high rates of overdose deaths in Sweden led to the
      decision by the Skåne County to initiate the first regional take-home naloxone
      program in Sweden. The project aims to study the effect of overdose prevention
      education and naloxone distribution on overdose mortality in Skåne County.
      Secondary outcome measures include non-fatal overdoses and overdose-related harm 
      in the general population, as well as cohort-specific effects in study
      participants regarding overdoses, mortality and retention in naloxone program.
      Methods: Implementation of a multi-site train-the-trainer cascade model was
      launched in June 2018. Twenty four facilities, including opioid substitution
      treatment units, needle exchange programs and in-patient addiction units were
      included for the first line of start-up, aspiring to reach a majority of
      individuals at-risk within the first 6 months. Serving as self-sufficient
      naloxone hubs, these units provide training, naloxone distribution and study
      recruitment. During 3 years, questionnaires are obtained from initial training,
      follow up, every sixth month, and upon refill. Estimated sample size is 2000
      subjects. Naloxone distribution rates are reported, by each unit, every 6 months.
      Medical diagnoses, toxicological raw data and data on mortality and cause of
      death will be collected from national and regional registers, both for included
      naloxone recipients and for the general population. Data on vital status and
      treatment needs will be collected from registers of emergency and prehospital
      care. Discussion: Despite a growing body of literature on naloxone distribution, 
      studies on population effect on mortality are scarce. Most previous studies and
      reports have been uncontrolled, thus not being able to link naloxone distribution
      to survival, in relation to a comparison period. As Swedish registers present the
      opportunity to monitor individuals and entire populations over time, conditions
      for conducting systematic follow-ups in the Swedish population are good, serving 
      the opportunity to study the impact of large scale overdose prevention education 
      and naloxone distribution and thus fill the knowledge gap. Trial registration:

TI  - Pain Assessment in Hemodialysis Patients.
LID - e6903
AB  - BackgroundPain is a common complaint among hemodialysis (HD) patients; however,
      most patients are not assessed for this aspect and are not sufficiently treated. 
      In these patients, pain is reported to be associated with a range of parameters
      like increased depression and disrupted quality of life (QOL). Previously
      residual renal function (RRF) was not assessed for associations with pain. The
      primary aim of the study is to evaluate the pain frequency in the Turkish HD
      patient population. In addition, the type, origin, and severity of chronic pain, 
      the pain treatment ratio, and the relationship between pain, QOL, and RRF were
      investigated during the study.MethodsThis study included 328 HD patients. Pain
      assessment used the McGill Pain Questionnaire and neuropathic pain assessment
      used the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) scale. The
      correlation of pain and quality of life was evaluated with the Short Form 36
      (SF-36) quality of life scale.ResultsOf patients, 244 experienced pain (74.4%),
      and this pain had a neuropathic character in 61.8% of these patients. Patients
      with pain had a longer dialysis duration than those without pain (4.00
      (2.00-8.00), 3.00 (2.00-4.75), p=0.01). The most common site of pain was the
      lower extremities. Pain was observed more often among females and with increasing
      age. Only 36.4% of patients used analgesics. The quality of life of patients with
      pain was found to be lower. The incidence of pain was higher among patients
      without RRF and had more neuropathic character.ConclusionsPain is a significant
      problem for the majority of HD patients and is not effectively managed. To
      increase the quality of life of patients, the care team should regularly question
      pain symptoms, and it should be treated effectively. In this context, RRF should 
      be regularly monitored and efforts should be made to preserve it.

TI  - Sustained Release of Levobupivacaine, Lidocaine, and Acemetacin from
      Electrosprayed Microparticles: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.
LID - 1093
AB  - In this study, we explored the release characteristics of analgesics, namely
      levobupivacaine, lidocaine, and acemetacin, from electrosprayed
      poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles. The drug-loaded particles
      were prepared using electrospraying techniques and evaluated for their
      morphology, drug release kinetics, and pain relief activity. The morphology of
      the produced microparticles elucidated by scanning electron microscopy revealed
      that the optimal parameters for electrospraying were 9 kV, 1 mL/h, and 10 cm for 
      voltage, flow rate, and travel distance, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared
      spectrometry indicated that the analgesics had been successfully incorporated
      into the PLGA microparticles. The analgesic-loaded microparticles possessed low
      toxicity against human fibroblasts and were able to sustainably elute
      levobupivacaine, lidocaine, and acemetacin in vitro. Furthermore, electrosprayed 
      microparticles were found to release high levels of lidocaine and acemetacin
      (well over the minimum therapeutic concentrations) and levobupivacaine at the
      fracture site of rats for more than 28 days and 12 days, respectively.
      Analgesic-loaded microparticles demonstrated their effectiveness and sustained
      performance for pain relief in fracture injuries.

TI  - Interaction effects in the association between methadone maintenance therapy and 
      experiences of racial discrimination in U.S. healthcare settings.
LID - e0228755
AB  - Background: Disparities in methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) outcomes have
      received limited attention, but there are important negative outcomes associated 
      with MMT that warrant investigation. Racial discrimination is common in
      healthcare settings and affects opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and
      comorbidities. However, race/ethnicity alone may not fully explain experiences of
      discrimination. MMT remains highly stigmatized and may compound the effect of
      race/ethnicity on discrimination in healthcare settings. We sought to quantify
      differential associations between MMT and experiences of racial discrimination
      between racial/ethnic groups in a U.S. national sample. Methods: We used the
      National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (2012–2013)
      to identify a subset of individuals with a lifetime OUD who had ever used MMT
      (survey n = 766; weighted population n = 5,276,507). We used multivariable
      logistic regression to model past-year experience of racial discrimination in a
      healthcare setting. We included an interaction term between race/ethnicity and
      MMT status to identify the odds of discrimination (MMT vs. no MMT [referent])
      within racial/ethnic groups. We used survey procedures with weights to account
      for the parent study’s complex survey design. Findings: Twenty-two percent of our
      sample experienced racial discrimination in a healthcare setting in the past
      year. Discrimination was more common among those who had ever used MMT (x2 =
      10.00, p = 0.001) and racial/ethnic minorities (x2 = 23.15, p<0.001). The
      interaction effect was much stronger than the main effects of race/ethnicity and 
      MMT status. MMT status (versus no MMT) was positively associated with
      discrimination among Blacks (aOR = 3.93, 95% CI = 3.87–3.98, p<0.001), Whites
      (aOR = 2.25, 95% CI = 2.23–2.27, p<0.001), and Latino/Latinas (aOR = 1.59, 95% CI
      = 1.55–1.62, p<0.001). Among American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), those who
      had used MMT had over thirty times the odds of racial discrimination, compared to
      their non-MMT counterparts (aOR = 32.78, 95% CI = 31.16–34.48, p<0.001).
      Conclusion: Race/ethnicity alone did not sufficiently account for racial
      discrimination in healthcare settings among those with a lifetime OUD. MMT status
      was strongly associated with racial discrimination among AI/AN. Our strong
      interaction effect is indicative of an additional barrier to health services
      utilization among AI/AN, which has important implications for OUD treatment
      outcomes and comorbidities. Health promotion programs aimed at increased adoption
      of MMT are promising, but should be considered in the context of racial/ethnic
      disparities, drug use and MMT stigma, and implicit biases in clinical settings.

TI  - Role of β-Caryophyllene in the Antinociceptive and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of
      Tagetes lucida Cav. Essential Oil.
LID - 675
AB  - Tagetes lucida Cav. (Asteraceae) is an ancient medicinal plant commonly used to
      alleviate pain. Nevertheless, scientific studies validating this property are
      lacking in the literature. Animal models of pain were used to evaluate the
      antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of T. lucida essential oil
      (TLEO) and a bioactive metabolite. The chemical constitution and possible
      toxicity of the extract and the mechanism of action of β-caryophyllene were also 
      explored. Temporal course curves and dose–response graphics were generated using 
      TLEO (0.1–10 mg/kg or 3.16–31.62 mg/kg) and β-caryophyllene (3.16–10 mg/kg).
      Metamizole (80 mg/kg) and indomethacin (20 mg/kg) were used as reference drugs in
      the formalin assay and writhing test in rats and mice, respectively. The
      β-caryophyllene mechanism of action was explored in the presence of naloxone (1
      mg/kg), flumazenil (10 mg/kg), WAY100635 (0.16 mg/kg), or nitro-l-arginine methyl
      ester (L-NAME) (20 mg/kg) in the formalin test in rats. GC/MS analysis
      demonstrated the presence of geranyl acetate (49.89%), geraniol (7.92%), and
      β-caryophyllene (6.27%). Significant and dose-dependent antinociceptive response 
      was produced by TLEO and β-caryophyllene without the presence of gastric damage. 
      In conclusion, β-caryophyllene was confirmed as a bioactive compound in the T.
      lucida analgesic properties by involving the participation of receptors like
      opioids, benzodiazepines, and Serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A), as well as nitric
      oxide.

TI  - Airway Pressure Release Ventilation: A Review of the Evidence, Theoretical
      Benefits, and Alternative Titration Strategies.
LID - 1179548420903297
AB  - Objective:: To review the theoretical benefits of airway pressure release
      ventilation (APRV), summarize the evidence for its use in clinical practice, and 
      discuss different titration strategies. Data Source:: Published randomized
      controlled trials in humans, observational human studies, animal studies, review 
      articles, ventilator textbooks, and editorials. Data Summary:: Airway pressure
      release ventilation optimizes alveolar recruitment, reduces airway pressures,
      allows for spontaneous breathing, and offers many hemodynamic benefits. Despite
      these physiologic advantages, there are inconsistent data to support the use of
      APRV over other modes of ventilation. There is considerable heterogeneity in the 
      application of APRV among providers and a shortage of information describing
      initiation and titration strategies. To date, no direct comparison studies of
      APRV strategies have been performed. This review describes 2 common management
      approaches that bedside providers can use to optimally tailor APRV to their
      patients. Conclusion:: Airway pressure release ventilation remains a form of
      mechanical ventilation primarily used for refractory hypoxemia. It offers unique 
      physiological advantages over other ventilatory modes, and providers must be
      familiar with different titration methods. Given its inconsistent outcome data
      and heterogeneous use in practice, future trials should directly compare APRV
      strategies to determine the optimal management approach.

TI  - A logistic regression analysis comparing minimalistic approach and intubation
      anaesthesia in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve
      replacement.
LID - e0227345
AB  - Aims: Patients with postoperative delirium (POD) after transcatheter aortic valve
      replacement (TAVR) are ventilated and hospitalized longer and suffer increased
      in-hospital mortality. This study hypothesized that a minimalistic approach with 
      conscious sedation during transfemoral aortic valve replacement (TF-AVR) protects
      against delirium, time of mechanical ventilation, and increased length of stay in
      intensive care unit (ICU) compared to intubation anaesthesia. Methods and
      results: 308 patients which underwent TF-AVR in our centre between 01/2013 and
      08/2017 were retrospectively evaluated regarding postoperative delirium, time of 
      mechanical ventilation, and days in ICU. TF-AVR was performed with intubation
      anaesthesia in 245 patients and with conscious sedation in 63. The operative risk
      estimated by the logEUROScore was similar in both groups (intubation: 13.28
      +/-9.06%, conscious sedation: 12.24 +/-6.77%, p = 0.395). In the conscious
      sedation group procedure duration was shorter (0.61 +/-0.91h vs. 1.75 +/-0.96h,
      p<0.001). The risk for intraprocedural complications was not influenced by the
      anaesthesia method (OR conscious sedation instead of intubation 1.66, p = 0.117),
      but days on ICU (-2.21 days, p<0.0001) and minutes of mechanical ventilation
      (-531.2 min, p < 0.0001) were reduced. Furthermore, the risk of POD was decreased
      when TF-AVR was performed under conscious sedation (6.35% vs. 18.18%, OR 0.29, p 
      = 0.021). Conclusions: Time of mechanical ventilation, risk of POD, and days on
      ICU were substantially reduced in patients who underwent TF-AVR under conscious
      sedation. Our data suggest that TF-AVR with conscious sedation is safe with a
      beneficial postoperative course in clinical practice, and should be considered
      the favoured approach.

TI  - Comparison of Biochemical Recurrence After Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical
      Prostatectomy with Volatile and Total Intravenous Anesthesia.
PG  - 449-56
AB  - Aims: Recurrence after cancer surgery is a major concern in patients with cancer.
      Growing evidence from preclinical studies has revealed that various anesthetics
      can influence the immune system in different ways. The current study compared the
      long-term biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after robot-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) in terms of selection of anesthetic
      agent between total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol/remifentanil and 
      volatile anesthetics (VA) with sevoflurane or desflurane/remifentanil.Methods: We
      followed up oncologic outcomes of patients who underwent RALP from two previous
      prospective randomized controlled trials, and the outcomes of those who received 
      TIVA (n = 64) were compared with those who received VA (n = 64). The follow-up
      period lasted from November 2010 to March 2019.Results: Both TIVA and VA groups
      showed identical biochemical recurrence-free survivals at all-time points after
      RALP. The following predictive factors of prostate cancer recurrence were
      determined by Cox regression: colloid input [hazard ratio (HR)=1.002, 95%
      confidence interval (CI): 1.000-1.003; P = 0.011], initial prostate-specific
      antigen level (HR=1.025, 95% CI: 1.007-1.044; P = 0.006), and pathological tumor 
      stage 3b (HR=4.217, 95% CI:1.207-14.735; P = 0.024), but not the anesthetic
      agent.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that both TIVA with
      propofol/remifentanil and VA with sevoflurane or desflurane/remifentanil have
      comparable effects on oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing RALP.

TI  - Effects of Labor Epidural Analgesia on Short Term Neonatal Morbidity.
PG  - 59-70
AB  - Background: Epidural Analgesia (EA) is the most effective and most commonly used 
      method for pain relief during labor. Some researchers have observed an
      association between EA and increased neonatal morbidity. But this observation was
      not consistent in many other studies. Objectives: The primary objective of the
      study was to examine whether exposure to epidural analgesia increased the risk of
      NICU admission. The secondary objectives included the risks of clinical
      chorioamnionitis, instrumental delivery, neonatal depression, respiratory
      distress, birth trauma, and neonatal seizure during the first 24 hours of life.
      Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study involving 2360 low-risk
      nulliparous women who delivered at AWH, Qatar, during the two years between
      January 2016 December and 2017. Short-term neonatal outcomes of the mothers who
      received EA in active labor were compared with a similar population who did not
      receive EA. As secondary objectives, labor parameters like maternal temperature
      elevation, duration of the second stage of labor, and instrumental delivery were 
      compared. Results: Significantly higher numbers of neonates were admitted to the 
      NICU from the EA group (P<0.001, OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.46). They were more
      likely to have respiratory distress (P=0.01, OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.07), birth
      injuries (P=0.02, OR =1.71, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.74), admission temperature>37.5 °C
      (P=0.04, OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 11.49), need for oxygen on the first day
      (P=0.04, OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.07) and receive antibiotics (P<0.001, OR
      2.06,95% CI 1.47 to 2.79). There was no difference in the Apgar score at 1 minute
      (P=0.12), need of resuscitation at birth (P=0.05), neonatal white cell count
      (P=0.34), platelet count (P=0.38) and C reactive protein (P=0.84). Mothers who
      received EA had a lengthier second stage (P<0.001), temperature elevation >37.5°C
      (P<0.001, OR 7.40, 95% CI 3.93 to 13.69) and instrumental delivery (P<0.001, OR
      2.13, 95% CI 1.69 to 2.68). Conclusion: EA increases NICU admission, antibiotic
      exposure, neonatal birth injuries, need for positive pressure ventilation at
      birth, and respiratory distress in the first 24 hours of life. Mothers on
      epidural analgesia have prolonged second stage of labor, a higher rate of
      instrumental delivery, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, fetal distress, and
      temperature elevation.

TI  - The Prevalence and Clinical Implications of Comorbid Back Pain in Shoulder
      Instability: A Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder
      Instability Cohort Study.
LID - 2325967119894738
AB  - Background:: Understanding predictors of pain is critical, as recent literature
      shows that comorbid back pain is an independent risk factor for worse functional 
      and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as well as increased opioid dependence after
      total joint arthroplasty. Purpose/Hypothesis:: The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate whether comorbid back pain would be predictive of pain or self-reported 
      instability symptoms at the time of stabilization surgery. We hypothesized that
      comorbid back pain will correlate with increased pain at the time of surgery as
      well as with worse scores on shoulder-related PRO measures. Study Design::
      Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods:: As part of the Multicenter
      Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder Instability cohort, patients
      consented to participate in pre- and intraoperative data collection. Demographic 
      characteristics, injury history, preoperative PRO scores, and radiologic and
      intraoperative findings were recorded for patients undergoing surgical shoulder
      stabilization. Patients were also asked, whether they had any back pain.
      Results:: The study cohort consisted of 1001 patients (81% male; mean age, 24.1
      years). Patients with comorbid back pain (158 patients; 15.8%) were significantly
      older (28.1 vs 23.4 years; P < .001) and were more likely to be female (25.3% vs 
      17.4%; P = .02) but did not differ in terms of either preoperative imaging or
      intraoperative findings. Patients with self-reported back pain had significantly 
      worse preoperative pain and shoulder-related PRO scores (American Shoulder and
      Elbow Surgeons score, Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index) (P < .001),
      more frequent depression (22.2% vs 8.3%; P < .001), poorer mental health status
      (worse scores for the RAND 36-Item Health Survey Mental Component Score, Iowa
      Quick Screen, and Personality Assessment Screener) (P < .01), and worse
      preoperative expectations (P < .01). Conclusion:: Despite having similar physical
      findings, patients with comorbid back pain had more severe preoperative pain and 
      self-reported symptoms of instability as well as more frequent depression and
      lower mental health scores. The combination of disproportionate shoulder pain,
      comorbid back pain and mental health conditions, and inferior preoperative
      expectations may affect not only the patient’s preoperative state but also
      postoperative pain control and/or postoperative outcomes.

TI  - Reciprocal association between depression and peptic ulcers: Two longitudinal
      follow-up studies using a national sample cohort.
LID - 1749
AB  - This study was aimed to explore the bidirectional association between depression 
      and peptic ulcers. The ≥20-year-old participants of the Korean National Health
      Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort from 2002 to 2013 were included in the
      study. In study I, 30,306 depression patients were 1:4 matched with 121,224
      control I participants. In study II, 127,590 peptic ulcer patients were 1:1
      matched with 127,590 control II participants. The stratified Cox-proportional
      hazards models were used to analyse the hazard ratio (HR) of depression for
      peptic ulcers (study I) and of peptic ulcers for depression (study II). A total
      of 8.9% (2,703/ 30,306) of depression patients and 7.3% (8,896/ 121,224) of
      patients in the control I group had peptic ulcers (P < 0.001). The depression
      group had an adjusted HR for peptic ulcers that was 1.14-fold higher than that of
      the control I group (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.09–1.19, P < 0.001). A 
      total of 6.4% (8,144/ 127,590) of peptic ulcer patients and 3.5% (4,515/127,590) 
      of patients in the control II group had depression (P < 0.001). The peptic ulcer 
      group had an adjusted HR for depression that was 1.68-fold higher than that of
      the control II group (95% CI = 1.62–1.74, P < 0.001). Depression and peptic
      ulcers exhibited a bidirectional relationship.

TI  - Mobile Peer-Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine
      Learning Tool.
LID - e200001
AB  - Background:: The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not
      receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access 
      to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs
      turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related 
      information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and
      during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery
      programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as
      reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and 
      scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content
      moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or “trolling”); and lack
      common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care. Methods:: This 
      present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile 
      treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure,
      technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. Forty adults
      receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked to pilot a
      smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the “Marigold App”, for a
      duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study to
      obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative
      interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform.
      Anticipated findings and future directions:: The Marigold mobile platform will
      allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to
      different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and
      constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the
      emotional sentiment in messages, automatically “flagging” critical or clinically 
      relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools 
      by adapting them to catch OUD-specific “flags” in peer messages while also
      examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.

TI  - Factors associated with the successful completion of a substance rehabilitation
      programme at a psychiatric training hospital.
LID - 1255
AB  - Background: Comorbid psychiatric and substance use disorders are common and
      present several treatment challenges. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine
      which patient and substance factors are associated with the completion of a
      substance rehabilitation programme in psychiatric inpatients. Setting: The study 
      was conducted at the Substance Rehabilitation Unit (SRU) at Weskoppies Hospital, 
      a psychiatric training hospital in South Africa, which offers a 6-week programme 
      at the hospital for psychiatric inpatients. Methods: This descriptive,
      retrospective hospital-based study was carried out comparing completers and
      non-completers of the SRU programme with respect to patient and substance
      factors. All patients accepted into the SRU during 2013–2014 were included (n =
      119). Data were collected over a year (2016–2017) from the clinical files, SRU
      referral forms, SRU attendance register, hospital computerised demographic
      records, nursing notes and administration files using a data collection sheet
      designed by the researchers for this study. Comparison between completers and
      non-completers was performed using Chi-Square or Fisher’s Exact tests. Results:
      The SRU accepted 119 patients from January 2013 to December 2014. The majority of
      the sample were involuntary patients (n = 39), 30–49 years old (n = 57), male (n 
      = 89), unmarried (n = 112), never having received a disability grant (n = 27),
      unemployed (n = 96) and with a Grade 8–11 education (n = 49). Substance-induced
      psychotic disorders (n = 39), schizophrenia (n = 29) and bipolar disorders (n =
      22) were found to be common. Frequent medical comorbidities included head injury 
      (n = 27), cardiovascular disease (n = 18) and HIV reactivity (n = 7). Cannabis (n
      = 98), alcohol (n = 94) and nicotine (n = 90) were the most frequently used
      substances. Level of education (p = 0.004), disability grant status (p = 0.004), 
      Nyaope use (p = 0.001) and nicotine use (p = 0.049) were statistically seen to be
      significantly associated with completion. Psychiatric diagnoses and general
      medical comorbidity were not associated with completion. Conclusions: This study 
      has yielded several results in areas that have not yet been well researched in
      South Africa. Risk factors for non-completion may include lower levels of
      education, being on a disability grant and using Nyaope or nicotine, but may vary
      in different settings. Future research should focus on identifying further
      factors that may affect completion of substance rehabilitation in psychiatric
      inpatients, the role of disability grants in patients with co-occurring disorders
      and the effect of Nyaope and nicotine use on treatment outcomes in this
      population. Effective and accessible interventions to assist vulnerable patients 
      also need to be identified.

TI  - Battlefield Acupuncture for Chronic Pain Management in Patients on Long-Term
      Opioid Therapy.
PG  - 38-44
AB  - Objectives: Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) is a unique auricular acupuncture
      procedure utilized by many Veterans Affairs Healthcare Administration facilities.
      Several previous studies have shown an immediate reduction in pain for up to 2
      weeks post BFA. The long-term effects of BFA and its potential to decrease opioid
      use had yet to be analyzed. This study was conducted to analyze the effectiveness
      of BFA to decrease chronic pain immediately and 6 months after treatment and to
      decrease the number of opioids needed for management of chronic pain.Materials
      and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study comparing veterans who
      received BFA and were prescribed opioids for their chronic pain to veterans who
      did not receive BFA. The treatment group included 24 veterans who received BFA
      and had opioid contracts. The comparison group consisted of 23 randomly selected 
      veterans who had opioid contracts but did not receive BFA. A numeric rating scale
      (NRS) was used to measure pain before and after treatment, as well as 3 months
      prior and 6 months post. The average morphine mg equivalents for opioids 3 months
      prior and 6 months post treatment were also compared. Differences between groups 
      were statistically analyzed by an analysis of variance and a Student's
      t-test.Results: Significant average decreases of 1.3 points on the NRS occurred
      in 66.1% immediately after the procedure. No significant decreases in pain were
      found. No significant changes of the average number of opioids over the 9 months 
      analyzed were found.Conclusions: BFA is effective for immediate pain reduction.
      Further research with a randomized controlled trial in a larger population is
      needed to assess BFA effects on chronic pain and opioid dependency.

TI  - Incidence of and risk factors for postoperative delirium in older adult patients 
      undergoing noncardiac surgery: a prospective study.
LID - 40
AB  - Background: To identify the incidence of, risk factors for, and outcomes
      associated with postoperative delirium (POD) in older adult patients who
      underwent noncardiac surgery. Methods: This prospective study recruited patients 
      aged ≥ 60 years who were scheduled to undergo noncardiac surgery at Siriraj
      Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand). Functional and cognitive statuses were assessed
      preoperatively using Barthel Index (BI) and the modified Informant Questionnaire 
      on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, respectively. POD was diagnosed based on the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition criteria.
      Incidence of POD was reported. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to 
      identify risk factors for POD. Results: Of the 249 included patients, 29 (11.6%) 
      developed POD. Most patients (61.3%) developed delirium on postoperative day 1.
      Univariate analysis showed age ≥ 75 years, BI score ≤ 70, pre-existing dementia, 
      preoperative use of opioid or benzodiazepine, preoperative infection, and
      hematocrit < 30% to be significantly associated with POD. Multivariate logistic
      analysis revealed pre-existing dementia (adjusted risk ratio [RR]: 3.95, 95%
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.91–8.17; p < 0.001) and age ≥ 75 years (adjusted RR: 
      2.54, 95% CI: 1.11–5.80; p = 0.027) to be independent risk factors for POD.
      Median length of hospital stay was 10 (range: 3–36) days for patients with POD
      versus 6 (range: 2–76) days for those without delirium (p < 0.001). Conclusions: 
      POD remains a common surgical complication, with an incidence of 11.6%. Patients 
      with pre-existing dementia and age ≥ 75 years are the most vulnerable high-risk
      group. A multidisciplinary team consisting of anesthesiologists and geriatricians
      should implement perioperative care to prevent and manage POD.

TI  - Opioid versus opioid-free analgesia after surgical discharge: protocol for a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - e035443
AB  - Introduction: Excessive prescribing after surgery has contributed to a public
      health crisis of opioid addiction and overdose in North America. However, the
      value of prescribing opioids to manage postoperative pain after surgical
      discharge remains unclear. We propose a systematic review and meta-analysis to
      assess the extent to which opioid analgesia impact postoperative pain intensity
      and adverse events in comparison to opioid-free analgesia in patients discharged 
      after surgery. Methods and analysis: Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase,
      Cochrane Library, Scopus, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL and PsycINFO) will be searched for
      multi-dose randomised-trials examining the comparative effectiveness of opioid
      versus opioid-free analgesia after surgical discharge. Studies published from
      January 1990 to July 2019 will be targeted, with no language restrictions. The
      search will be re-run before manuscript submission to include most recent
      literature. We will consider studies involving patients undergoing minor and
      major surgery. Teams of reviewers will, independently and in duplicate, assess
      eligibility, extract data and evaluate risk of bias. Our main outcomes of
      interest are pain intensity and postoperative vomiting. Study results will be
      pooled using random effects models. When trials report outcomes for a common
      domain (eg, pain intensity) using different scales, we will convert effect sizes 
      to a common standard metric (eg, Visual Analogue Scale). Minimally important
      clinical differences reported in previous literature will be considered when
      interpreting results. Subgroup analyses defined a priori will be conducted to
      explore heterogeneity. Risk of bias will be assessed according to the Cochrane
      Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. The quality of evidence for all outcomes
      will be evaluated using the GRADE rating system. Ethics and dissemination:
      Ethical approval is not required since this is a systematic review of published
      studies. Our results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented
      at relevant conferences. Further knowledge dissemination will be sought via
      public and patient organisations focussed on pain and opioid-related harms.

TI  - Comprehensive Care for Patients with Sarcoidosis.
LID - 390
AB  - Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease, associated with significant
      morbidity and impaired quality of life. Treatment is aimed at recovering organ
      function, reducing symptom burden and improving quality of life. Because of the
      heterogeneity and variable disease course, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary
      approach to care is needed. Comprehensive care includes not only pharmacological 
      interventions, but also supportive measures aimed at relieving symptoms and
      improving quality of life. The purpose of this review is to summarize the most
      recent knowledge regarding different aspects of care and propose a structured
      approach to sarcoidosis management.

TI  - Lumbar Erector Spinae Plane Block as a Main Anesthetic Method for Hip Surgery in 
      High Risk Elderly Patients: Initial Experience with a Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
PG  - 16-20
AB  - Objective: Since initial description by Forero for thoracic region, ultrasound
      guided erector spinae plane (ESP) block has experienced several surgeries for
      postoperative pain management, chronic pain or surgical anesthesia. Although ESP 
      block has been reported to provide effective analgesia in the thoracic region,
      its effect in lumbar region still unclear. In this study we aimed to showed our
      successful experience with lumbar ESP block as a main anesthetic technique in
      fifteen high risk elderly patients undergoing hip surgery with mild propofol
      sedation. Materials and Methods: In this observational study high risk elderly
      fifteen patients received lumbar ESP block as a main anesthetic technique with
      mild propofol sedation. 40 mL of local anesthetic mixture (20 mL bupivacaine
      0.5%, 10 mL lidocaine 2%, and 10 mL normal saline) was administered between the
      erector spinae muscles and transverse process at the level of the 4th lumbar
      vertebra. Also we demonstrate magnetic resonance images and discuss the anatomic 
      basis of lumbar ESP block. Results: All patients’ surgeries were completed
      without requirement for general anesthesia or local anesthesia infiltration of
      the surgical site. All patients’ pain scores were <2/10 in the recovery room.
      Significant contrast spread was observed between the Th12 and L5 transverse
      process and erector spinae muscle and between multifidus muscle and iliocostal
      muscle at the L2–4 levels. Contrast material was observed at the anterior of the 
      transverse process spreading to the paravertebral, foraminal and partially
      epidural area/spaces and also in the areas where the lumbar nerves enter the
      psoas muscle. Conclusion: Lumbar ESP block when combined with mild sedoanalgesia 
      provides adequate and safe anesthesia in high risk elderly patients undergoing
      hip surgery.

TI  - Fentanyl inhibits the progression of gastric cancer through the suppression of
      MMP-9 via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
LID - 118
AB  - Background: Fentanyl is a drug commonly used for perioperative and postoperative 
      analgesia. Previous studies have confirmed that fentanyl can affect the
      progression of gastric cancer; however, this effect has not yet been elucidated. 
      The purpose of our study was thus to investigate the role of fentanyl in gastric 
      cancer and clarify its potential mechanisms. Methods: A CCK-8 assay was used to
      determine the proliferation of MGC-803 cells, while Transwell assay and wound
      healing assay were used to determine the invasion and migration abilities,
      respectively. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were assessed by flow cytometry, and
      the ultrastructure of the cells was examined with a transmission electron
      microscope. The mRNA expression levels of serine-threonine protein kinase 1
      (Akt-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and death-associated protein kinase 
      1 (DAPK1) were evaluated by real-time (RT) quantitative PCR. The protein
      expression of p-Akt, MMP-9, and caspase-9 was detected by western blot analysis. 
      To study the interaction of fentanyl with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
      (PI3K)/Akt/MMP-9 pathway, PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and MMP-9 inhibitor (SB-3CT) 
      were used to treat the MGC-803 cells. Results: Findings indicated that fentanyl
      inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and migration of MGC-803 cells.
      Specifically, fentanyl inhibits the expression of MMP-9 and enhances the
      expression of apoptosis-promoting factors such as caspase-9 and DAPK1 through the
      PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Cell cycle arrest was observed in the G0/G1 phase.
      Furthermore, the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/MMP-9 by LY294002 and SB-3CT enhanced the
      anticancer effects of fentanyl. Conclusions: Fentanyl inhibits the proliferation,
      invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/MMP-9
      pathway, which could be very useful for gastric cancer treatment.

TI  - Robotic adrenalectomy: when and how?
PG  - S166-72
AB  - Currently, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is considered as the preferred technique to
      manage adrenal tumors. However, there are no prospective randomized studies
      evaluating this strategy. With the recent advances in surgical equipment and the 
      widespread of robotic technology, a robotic approach is considered as an
      interesting option in some medical centers. This approach seems to be feasible
      and safe but high-level evidence of its benefits is still lacking. This review
      summarizes indications, advantages and drawbacks of robotic adrenalectomy and
      describes its surgical technique.

TI  - Polysubstance Use: A Broader Understanding of Substance Use During the Opioid
      Crisis.
PG  - 244-50
AB  - Objectives. To understand important changes in co-occurring opioid and nonopioid 
      drug use (i.e., polysubstance use) within the opioid epidemic in the United
      States.Methods. We analyzed survey data on the past month co-use of prescription 
      and illicit opioids and 12 nonopioid psychoactive drug classes from a national
      sample of 15 741 persons entering treatment of opioid use disorder.Results.
      Past-month illicit opioid use increased from 44.8% in 2011 to 70.1% in 2018,
      while the use of prescription opioids alone dropped from 55.2% to 29.9%, yet
      overall remained high (94.5% to 85.2%). Past-month use of at least 1 nonopioid
      drug occurred in nearly all participants (> 90%), with significant increases in
      methamphetamine (+85%) and decreases across nonopioid prescription drug classes
      (range: −40% to –68%).Conclusions. Viewing opioid trends in a “silo” ignores the 
      fact not only that polysubstance use is ubiquitous among those with opioid use
      disorder but also that significant changes in polysubstance use should be
      monitored alongside opioid trends.Public Health Implications. Treatment,
      prevention, and policymaking must address not only the supply and demand of a
      singular drug class but also the global nature of substance use overall.

TI  - Association Between a State Law Allowing Pharmacists to Dispense Naloxone Without
      a Prescription and Naloxone Dispensing Rates.
LID - e1920310
AB  - Question: Is an Ohio law allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a
      prescription in accordance with a physician-approved protocol associated with an 
      increase in naloxone dispensing rates? Findings: In this cohort study of patients
      in Ohio who received naloxone, the number of naloxone orders dispensed after the 
      state law was implemented increased by 2328%, and the naloxone dispensing rate
      per month per county increased significantly in the Ohio Medicaid (4%) and Kroger
      Pharmacy (3%) populations. In the Ohio Medicaid population, the naloxone
      dispensing rate in low-employment counties increased by 18% compared with
      high-employment counties. Meaning: The implementation of an Ohio law allowing
      pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a prescription was associated with a
      significant increase in naloxone dispensing rates, especially in low-employment
      counties.

TI  - Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder in Pregnant Women via Telemedicine: A
      Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.
LID - e1920177
AB  - Question: Is opioid use disorder treatment received via telemedicine in obstetric
      practices associated with similar maternal and newborn outcomes compared with
      opioid use disorder treatment received in person in obstetric practices?
      Findings: In this nonrandomized controlled trial including 98 pregnant women with
      opioid use disorder, there were no statistically significant differences in rates
      of retention in treatment between women receiving opioid use disorder treatment
      via telemedicine vs in person (80.4% vs 92.7%). These findings were also apparent
      in newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome (telemedicine: 45.4% vs in person: 
      63.2%). Meaning: Telemedicine may provide a scalable solution to making
      lifesaving treatment available to pregnant women to reduce the maternal morbidity
      and mortality associated with opioid use disorder and improve maternal and child 
      health.

TI  - TLR4-Targeting Therapeutics: Structural Basis and Computer-Aided Drug Discovery
      Approaches.
LID - 627
AB  - The integration of computational techniques into drug development has led to a
      substantial increase in the knowledge of structural, chemical, and biological
      data. These techniques are useful for handling the big data generated by
      empirical and clinical studies. Over the last few years, computer-aided drug
      discovery methods such as virtual screening, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative
      structure-activity relationship analysis, and molecular docking have been
      employed by pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers for the development
      of pharmacologically active drugs. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a vital role
      in various inflammatory, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders such as
      sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
      multiple sclerosis, cancer, and systemic lupus erythematosus. TLRs, particularly 
      TLR4, have been identified as potential drug targets for the treatment of these
      diseases, and several relevant compounds are under preclinical and clinical
      evaluation. This review covers the reported computational studies and techniques 
      that have provided insights into TLR4-targeting therapeutics. Furthermore, this
      article provides an overview of the computational methods that can benefit a
      broad audience in this field and help with the development of novel drugs for
      TLR-related disorders.

TI  - Opioid Prescribing Behaviors — Prescription Behavior Surveillance System, 11
      States, 2010–2016.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Problem/Condition: In 2017, a total of 70,237 persons in the United States died
      from a drug overdose, and 67.8% of these deaths involved an opioid. Historically,
      the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States has been closely associated
      with a parallel increase in opioid prescribing and with widespread misuse of
      these medications. National and state policy makers have introduced multiple
      measures to attempt to assess and control the opioid overdose epidemic since
      2010, including improvements in surveillance systems. Period Covered: 2010–2016
      Description of System: The Prescription Behavior Surveillance System (PBSS) was
      created in 2011. Its goal was to track rates of prescribing of controlled
      substances and possible misuse of such drugs using data from selected state
      prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP). PBSS data measure prescribing
      behaviors for prescription opioids using multiple measures calculated from PDMP
      data including 1) opioid prescribing, 2) average daily opioid dosage, 3)
      proportion of patients with daily opioid dosages ≥90 morphine milligram
      equivalents, 4) overlapping opioid prescriptions, 5) overlapping opioid and
      benzodiazepine prescriptions, and 6) multiple-provider episodes. For this
      analysis, PBSS data were available for 2010–2016 from 11 states representing
      approximately 38.0% of the U.S. population. Average quarterly percent changes
      (AQPC) in the rates of opioid prescribing and possible opioid misuse measures
      were calculated for each state. Results and Interpretation: Opioid prescribing
      rates declined in all 11 states during 2010–2016 (range: 14.9% to 33.0%). Daily
      dosage declined least (AQPC: -0.4%) in Idaho and Maine, and most (AQPC: -1.6%) in
      Florida. The percentage of patients with high daily dosage had AQPCs ranging from
      -0.4% in Idaho to -2.3% in Louisiana. Multiple-provider episode rates declined by
      at least 62% in the seven states with available data. Variations in trends across
      the 11 states might reflect differences in state policies and possible
      differential effects of similar policies. Public Health Actions: Use of PDMP data
      from individual states enables a more detailed examination of trends in opioid
      prescribing behaviors and indicators of possible misuse than is feasible with
      national commercially available prescription data. Comparison of opioid
      prescribing trends among states can be used to monitor the temporal association
      of national or state policy interventions and might help public health
      policymakers recognize changes in the use or possible misuse of controlled
      prescription drugs over time and allow for prompt intervention through amended or
      new opioid-related policies.

TI  - Strategies for the Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease: Beyond Dopamine.
LID - 4
AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second-leading cause of dementia and is
      characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
      nigra alongside the presence of intraneuronal α-synuclein-positive inclusions.
      Therapies to date have been directed to the restoration of the dopaminergic
      system, and the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal cell death in the midbrain.
      This review discusses the physiological mechanisms involved in PD as well as new 
      and prospective therapies for the disease. The current data suggest that
      prevention or early treatment of PD may be the most effective therapeutic
      strategy. New advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of PD
      predict the development of more personalized and integral therapies in the years 
      to come. Thus, the development of more reliable biomarkers at asymptomatic stages
      of the disease, and the use of genetic profiling of patients will surely permit a
      more effective treatment of PD.

TI  - Increased risk of perforated appendicitis in patients with schizophrenia and
      dementia: A population-based case-control study.
LID - e18919
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that patients with psychotic or mental disorders 
      are relatively pain insensitive, resulting in difficulties in the diagnosis of
      acute intra-abdominal diseases requiring emergency surgeries. We aimed to
      evaluate whether central nervous system (CNS) or mental disorders are associated 
      with perforated appendicitis in patients with acute appendicitis.We conducted a
      population-based case-control study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance
      Research database. Patients aged >18 years who had been hospitalized with a
      diagnosis of acute appendicitis between 2000 and 2013 were identified. After 1:1 
      matching for age and sex, 2792 patients with perforated appendicitis (case group)
      and 2792 patients with nonperforated appendicitis (control group) were included. 
      CNS disorders, mental disorders, pain control medication, and several
      comorbidities were analyzed for the odds of appendiceal perforation with 95%
      confidence interval (CI) using the multivariable logistic regression
      model.Schizophrenia and dementia were associated with a high risk of appendiceal 
      rupture in patients with acute appendicitis, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.01 
      for dementia (95% CI: 1.19–3.39, P = .009) and 4.8 for schizophrenia (95% CI:
      1.62–14.19, P = .005). Other factors, such as other CNS disorders, comorbidities,
      and pain control medication, were not associated with the risk of perforated
      appendicitis.Dementia and schizophrenia are associated with perforated
      appendicitis in patients with acute appendicitis. This might be owing to altered 
      pain perception, difficult symptom expression, and delayed hospitalization.
      Further studies are still needed to determine the underlying mechanism and
      confirm the causality.

TI  - Midlife mortality in White non-Hispanic male veterans enrolled in Department of
      Veterans Affairs primary care, 2003–2014.
LID - e03328
AB  - Background: After years of decline in mortality rates in the United States, there
      have been increases in mortality rates in White non-Hispanic Americans ages
      45–54, due to increases in deaths from suicide, poisoning, and alcoholic liver
      disease. Objectives: To determine whether White non-Hispanic middle age male
      Veterans enrolled in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary care had
      increased mortality, as found in the general population. Research design:
      Repeated cross-sectional analysis over 12 years to describe trends in death rates
      for men across 3 race/ethnicity groups (White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic,
      Hispanic) and 2 age groups (45–54, 55–64) for the Veteran and general US male
      populations. Subjects: 60 million patient-years for Veterans enrolled in VA
      primary care from 2003 to 2014 and 1.8 million who died during the study period. 
      Measures: All-cause and cause specific death rates for alcoholic liver disease,
      poisoning, and suicide. Results: For White non-Hispanic male Veterans ages 55–64,
      the increase in all-cause mortality from 2003 to 2014 (+309 deaths/100,000) was
      accompanied by significant changes in deaths due to poisoning (+30/100,000),
      alcoholic liver disease (+23/100,000), and suicide (+17/100,000). For US men ages
      55–64, all-cause mortality decreased slightly from 2003-2014 (-22
      deaths/100,000). However, there were increases in death rates due to poisoning
      (+17/100,000), alcoholic liver disease (+14/100,000) and suicide (+11/100,000).
      Conclusions: These disturbing findings for White non-Hispanic Veteran men ages
      55–64 suggest the critical importance of suicide prevention programs as well as
      the importance of high quality integrated health care for both Veteran and
      non-Veteran men.

TI  - Brazilian Nutritional Consensus in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation:
      Adults.
LID - AE4530
AB  - The nutritional status of patients submitted to hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant is considered an independent risk factor, which may influence on
      quality of life and tolerance to the proposed treatment. The impairment of
      nutritional status during hematopoietic stem cell transplant occurs mainly due to
      the adverse effects resulting from conditioning to which the patient is
      subjected. Therefore, adequate nutritional evaluation and follow-up during
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant are essential. To emphasize the importance of 
      nutritional status and body composition during treatment, as well as the main
      characteristics related to the nutritional assessment of the patient, the
      Brazilian Consensus on Nutrition in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant: Adults
      was prepared, aiming to standardize and update Nutritional Therapy in this area. 
      Dietitians, nutrition physicians and hematologists from 15 Brazilian centers thar
      are references in hematopoietic stem cell transplant took part.

TI  - Chronic pain diagnoses and opioid dispensings among insured individuals with
      serious mental illness.
LID - 40
AB  - Background: Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder
      (BD) have particularly high rates of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) and are also 
      more likely to receive prescription opioids for their pain. However, there have
      been no known studies published to date that have examined opioid treatment
      patterns among individuals with schizophrenia. Methods: Using electronic medical 
      record data across 13 Mental Health Research Network sites, individuals with
      diagnoses of MDD (N = 65,750), BD (N = 38,117) or schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder (N = 12,916) were identified and matched on age, sex and
      Medicare status to controls with no documented mental illness. CNCP diagnoses and
      prescription opioid medication dispensings were extracted for the matched
      samples. Multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate (1) the odds of
      receiving a pain-related diagnosis and (2) the odds of receiving opioids, by
      separate mental illness diagnosis category compared with matched controls,
      controlling for age, sex, Medicare status, race/ethnicity, income, medical
      comorbidities, healthcare utilization and chronic pain diagnoses. Results:
      Multivariable models indicated that having a MDD (OR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.85–1.95) 
      or BD (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.66–1.77) diagnosis was associated with increased
      odds of a CNCP diagnosis after controlling for age, sex, race, income, medical
      comorbidities and healthcare utilization. By contrast, having a schizophrenia
      diagnosis was associated with decreased odds of receiving a chronic pain
      diagnosis (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.82–0.90). Having a MDD (OR = 2.59; 95%
      CI = 2.44–2.75) or BD (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.97–2.28) diagnosis was associated
      with increased odds of receiving chronic opioid medications, even after
      controlling for age, sex, race, income, medical comorbidities, healthcare
      utilization and chronic pain diagnosis; having a schizophrenia diagnosis was not 
      associated with receiving chronic opioid medications. Conclusions: Individuals
      with serious mental illness, who are most at risk for developing opioid-related
      problems, continue to be prescribed opioids more often than their peers without
      mental illness. Mental health clinicians may be particularly well-suited to lead 
      pain assessment and management efforts for these patients. Future research is
      needed to evaluate the effectiveness of involving mental health clinicians in
      these efforts.

TI  - Suicide among people treated for drug use disorders: a Danish national
      record-linkage study.
LID - 146
AB  - Background: Substance use disorders are a major risk factor for suicide. However,
      less is known about specific risk factors for suicide in people with substance
      use disorders. Methods: This population cohort study assessed suicide among
      people treated for drug use disorders in Denmark 2000–2010, and described risk
      factors for completed suicide. Data from 27,942 individuals enrolled in treatment
      were linked to national registers and matched with controls without drug use
      disorder and with (n = 138,136) or without psychiatric history (n = 1574).
      Competing risk regression was used to identify risk factors of completed suicide.
      Results: There were 163 suicides among patients with a history of drug treatment 
      (0.6% of patients). Increased risk was associated with younger age at enrolment
      (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95, 0.98), history of 
      psychiatric care (HR = 1.96, CI 95%: 1.39, 2.77), opioid use (HR = 1.81, 95% CI: 
      1.23, 2.68), and alcohol use (HR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.23). Lower risk was
      associated with cannabis use (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.96). Compared with age- 
      and gender-matched controls without a history of treatment for substance use
      disorders or recent psychiatric care, the standardized mortality ratio due to
      suicide was 7.13 for people with drug use disorder without a history of
      psychiatric care (95% CI: 5.81, 8.44), 13.48 for people with drug use disorder
      and psychiatric history (95% CI: 9.75, 17.22), and 13.61 for people with
      psychiatric history only (95% CI: 6.72, 20.50). Conclusions: Risk of suicide is
      increased among people with drug use disorders. Access to treatment for co-morbid
      mental health problems for people with drug use disorders could potentially
      reduce risk of suicide.

TI  - Correlations between opioid mortality increases related to illicit/synthetic
      opioids and reductions of medical opioid dispensing - exploratory analyses from
      Canada.
LID - 143
AB  - Background: North America has been experiencing a persistent epidemic of
      opioid-related overdose mortality, which has increasingly been driven by
      fatalities from illicit, toxic opioids in most recent years. Patterns of
      synthetic opioid availability and related mortality are heterogeneous across
      Canada, and differing explanations exist as to their differentiated
      proliferation. We examined the perspective that heterogeneous province-based
      variations in prescription opioid availability, facilitated by various control
      strategies, post-2010 may have created regionally differential supply gaps for
      non-medical opioid use substituted by synthetic opioid products with differential
      impacts on mortality risks and outcomes in Canada. Methods: We examined annual,
      prescription opioid dispensing rates and changes in the ten Canadian provinces
      (for the periods of 1) 2011–2018, 2) ‘peak-year’-to-2018) in Defined Daily
      Doses/1000 population/day, derived from data from a large representative,
      stratified sample of community pharmacies projected to a Canada total. Annual,
      provincial opioid-related mortality rates and changes for years 2016–2018 were
      calculated from federal data. We computed correlation values (Pearson’s R)
      between respective province-based change rates for prescription opioid dispensing
      and opioid-related mortality for the two over-time scenarios. Results: All but
      one province featured reductions in prescription opioid dispensing 2011–2018;
      seven of the ten provinces had increases in opioid mortality 2016–2018. The
      correlation between changes in opioid dispensing (2011–2018) and in
      opioid-mortality (2016–2018) was r = 0.63 (df = 8, p-value: 0.05); the
      correlation was r = 0.57 (df = 8, p-value: 0.09) for changes in opioid dispensing
      ‘peak year’-to-2018, respectively. Conclusions: Quasi-significant results
      indicate that recent increases in opioid-related deaths driven by illicit,
      synthetic opioids tended to be larger in provinces where reductions in
      prescription opioid availability have been more extensive. It is a plausible
      explanation that these reductions created supply gaps for non-medical opioid use 
      increasingly filled by illicit, synthetic opioids differentially contributing to 
      opioid-related deaths, generating un-intended adverse effects for previous
      interventions. General prevention measures to reduce opioid availability, and
      targeted prevention for at-risk opioid users exposed to toxic drug supply may be 
      include counteractive effects and require coordinated reconciliation.

TI  - The National Ambulance Surveillance System: A novel method for monitoring acute
      alcohol, illicit and pharmaceutical drug related-harms using coded Australian
      ambulance clinical records.
LID - e0228316
AB  - Although harmful consumption of alcohol and other drugs (both illicit and
      pharmaceutical) significantly contribute to global burden of disease, not all
      harms are captured within existing morbidity data sources. Indeed, harms
      occurring in the community may be missed or under-reported. This paper describes 
      the National Ambulance Surveillance System, a unique Australian system for
      monitoring and mapping acute harms related to alcohol and other drug consumption.
      Data are sourced from paramedic electronic patient care records provided by
      ambulance services from across Australia. Coding occurs in a purpose-built
      system, by a team of specialised research assistants. Alcohol, and specific
      illicit and pharmaceutical drugs, rather than broad drug classes, are manually
      coded and the dataset is reviewed and cleaned prior to analysis. The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an ongoing, dynamic surveillance system of
      alcohol and other drug-related harms across Australia. The data includes more
      than 140 output variables per attendance, including individual substances,
      demographics, temporal, geospatial, and clinical data (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale
      score, naloxone provision and response, outcome of attendance). The National
      Ambulance Surveillance System is an internationally unique population-level
      surveillance system of acute harms arising from alcohol and other drug
      consumption. Dissemination of National Ambulance Surveillance System data has
      been used to inform and evaluate policy approaches and potential points of
      intervention, as well as guide workforce development needs and clinical practice 
      at the local and national level. This methodology could be replicated in other
      countries.

TI  - Adapting a peer recovery coach-delivered behavioral activation intervention for
      problematic substance use in a medically underserved community in Baltimore City.
LID - e0228084
AB  - Low-income, racial/ethnic minority groups have disproportionately high rates of
      problematic substance use yet face barriers in accessing evidence-based
      interventions (EBIs). Peer recovery coaches (PRCs), individuals with lived
      experience with problematic substance use, may provide an effective approach to
      reaching these individuals. Traditionally PRCs have focused on bridging to other 
      types of care rather than delivering EBIs themselves. The aim of this study was
      to assess perceptions of the appropriateness of a PRC-delivered adapted
      behavioral activation (BA) intervention to reduce problematic substance use for
      individuals not engaged in care. This study was conducted at a community resource
      center in Baltimore, Maryland serving low-income and homeless clients who have
      high rates of problematic substance use yet also face barriers to accessing care.
      Guided by the ADAPT-ITT framework, we conducted semi-structured key informant
      interviews with clients (n = 30) with past or present problematic substance use, 
      and a focus group with community providers, including staff at the community
      resource center (n = 5) and PRCs (n = 6) from the community. Thirty percent (n = 
      9) of clients interviewed reported past problematic substance use and 70% (n =
      21) met criteria for current use, most commonly cocaine and opioids. Clients,
      center staff, and PRCs shared that PRC-delivered BA could be acceptable and
      appropriate with suggested adaptations, including adding peer-delivered
      case-management and linkage to care alongside BA, and tailoring BA to include
      activities that are accessible and feasible in the community. These findings will
      inform the adaptation of PRC-delivered BA to address problematic substance use in
      this setting.

TI  - Desmetramadol Is Identified as a G-Protein Biased µ Opioid Receptor Agonist.
LID - 1680
AB  - Tramadol is widely used globally and is the second most prescribed opioid in the 
      United States. It treats moderate to severe pain but lethal opioid-induced
      respiratory depression is uncommon even in large overdose. It is unknown why
      tramadol spares respiration. Here we show its active metabolite, desmetramadol,
      is as effective as morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl in eliciting G protein
      coupling at the human µ opioid receptor (MOR), but surprisingly, supratherapeutic
      concentrations spare human MOR-mediated βarrestin2 recruitment thought to mediate
      lethal opioid-induced respiratory depression.

TI  - Propoxyphene Mediates Oxyhemoglobin-Induced Injury in Rat Cortical Neurons
      Through Up-Regulation of Active-β-Catenin.
LID - 1616
AB  - Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in various biological processes, including
      the development of the central nervous system. The dysfunction of mitochondria
      has been shown to participate in the progress of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
      Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH) is a serious complication in acute
      craniocerebral trauma. Opioids can activate the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling
      pathway. c-Myc, a downstream protein of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, contributes to
      the fusion of mitochondria. Here, we investigated the protective roles of
      Propoxyphene (Pro) against Oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb)-induced primary cultured neuron 
      apoptosis. The data indicated that Pro rescued active-β-catenin from
      OxyHb-induced decline. Furthermore, Pro attenuated OxyHb-induced apoptosis and
      fission of mitochondria in primary cortical neurons. However, the protective
      effects were abrogated under active-β-catenin-deficient conditions. Together, the
      data presented here showed that Pro, a weak opioid analgesic drug, attenuates
      OxyHb-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in an
      active-β-catenin-c-Myc-dependent manner.

TI  - Cannabis and Pain Treatment—A Review of the Clinical Utility and a Practical
      Approach in Light of Uncertainty.
LID - e0002
AB  - Over the past decade the phenomenon of cannabis as a legitimate form of treatment
      for pain has overwhelmed the medical community, especially in the field of pain. 
      From a status of a schedule 1 substance having no currently accepted medical use 
      and being considered to have high potential for abuse, its use has mushroomed to 
      over 50,000 legal medical users per year in Israel alone. There appear to be many
      reasons behind this phenomenon—medical, sociological, and economical. Thus, what 
      is cannabis? An abusive substance or a medication? Should it be incorporated into
      current biomedical practice, and how should it be administered? Finally, what is 
      the evidence for the beneficial and detrimental effects of cannabis? This article
      reviews and discusses the current literature regarding the beneficial and the
      detrimental effects of medical cannabis in the treatment of pain. We further
      discuss the problems and challenges facing the medical community in this domain
      and offer a practical approach to deal with these challenges.

TI  - Spinal versus General Anesthesia for Patients with Parkinson’s Disease.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - Background: Anesthesiologists prefer using general anesthesia (GA) in Parkinson’s
      disease (PD). However, GA may mask neurological symptoms in the intraoperative
      period and exacerbate them postoperatively. Furthermore, the anesthetics used in 
      GA have clear interactions with the drugs used to control PD. On the other hand, 
      drugs used in spinal anesthesia (SA) might be safer for patients with PD. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the effect of SA and GA in patients with PD who
      underwent hip fracture repairs. Methods: Retrospectively, we identified those
      patients with PD who were admitted due to hip joint fracture. The following
      information were obtained: demographics, preoperative assessment information of
      the patients, type of anesthesia, and types of fractures and orthopedic
      procedures. In addition, intraoperative and postoperative complications were
      studied. The patients were divided based on the type of anesthesia received and
      were compared. Results: Ten (8 males) patients with PD who underwent hip fracture
      surgery included in the study. Six patients received SA and 4 patients received
      GA. The mean age was 73.2 years. The preoperative assessment was not significant 
      for all patients. Postoperatively, within the inpatient period, 3 out of 4
      patients received GA developed complications (two atelectasis and urinary tract
      infection) while no patient developed complication from the SA group.
      Postoperative outpatient complications within one-month included 3 out of 4 cases
      in the GA group and only one complication in the SA group. The mean
      hospitalization period was 9 days for patients received GA and 5.8 days for
      patients received SA. Conclusion: This study reported less perioperative
      complications in the SA. Accordingly, further investigations and rp-randomized
      controlled trials evaluating various anesthetic techniques or drugs are needed.

      Setting: A Baseline Analysis of the Asia and Latin America Fracture Observational
      Study (ALAFOS).
PG  - 111-21
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this analysis is to describe the baseline characteristics of 
      patients who are prescribed teriparatide for the treatment of postmenopausal
      osteoporosis in a real-world setting in East Asia. Patients and Methods: The Asia
      and Latin America Fracture Observational Study (ALAFOS) is a prospective,
      multinational, observational study designed to evaluate real-world use of
      teriparatide in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 20 countries
      across Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia. This subregional
      analysis focuses on the East Asian subpopulation of the ALAFOS study. Here we
      report baseline clinical characteristics, details regarding the history of
      fractures, risk factors for osteoporosis, comorbidities, osteoporosis treatment, 
      and health-related quality of life in patients enrolled in China, Hong Kong,
      South Korea, and Taiwan. Results: The East Asian subgroup of ALAFOS included 1136
      postmenopausal women, constituting 37.5% (1136/3031) of the overall ALAFOS
      patient population. The mean (SD) age was 75.0 (9.6) years. The mean (SD) bone
      mineral density T-scores were −3.11 (1.54), −2.58 (1.11), and −2.86 (1.09) at the
      lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, respectively; 69.6% of patients had
      experienced at least one fragility fracture and 40.4% had experienced ≥2
      fragility fractures after 40 years of age. Overall, 63.3% of patients had used
      medications for osteoporosis in the past. The mean (SD) EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS) score at baseline was 59.7 (20.8); the mean (SD) back pain numeric
      rating scale score for worst pain in the last 24 hrs was 5.2 (3.2). Conclusion:
      Our results indicate that patients who are prescribed teriparatide in East Asia
      were elderly women with severe osteoporosis, low bone mineral density, high
      prevalence of fractures, back pain and poor health-related quality of life. Most 
      of the patients received teriparatide as a second-line treatment.

TI  - Job postings in the substance use disorder treatment related sector during the
      first five years of Medicaid expansion.
LID - e0228394
AB  - Background: Effective treatment strategies exist for substance use disorder
      (SUD), however severe hurdles remain in ensuring adequacy of the SUD treatment
      (SUDT) workforce as well as improving SUDT affordability, access and stigma.
      Although evidence shows recent increases in SUD medication access from expanding 
      Medicaid availability under the Affordable Care Act, it is yet unknown whether
      these policies also led to a growth in hiring in the SUDT related workforce,
      partly due to poor data availability. Our study uses novel data to shed light on 
      recent trends in a fast-evolving and policy-relevant labor market, and
      contributes to understanding data sources to track the SUDT related workforce and
      the effect of recent state healthcare policies on the supply side of this sector.
      Methods and data: We examine hiring attempts in the SUDT and related behavioral
      health sector over 2010-2018 to estimate the causal effect of the 2014-and-beyond
      state Medicaid expansions on these outcomes through “difference-in-difference”
      econometric models. We use Burning Glass Technologies (BGT) data covering
      virtually all U.S. job postings by employers. Findings: Nationally, we find
      little growth in the sector’s hiring attempts in 2010-2018 relative to the rest
      of the economy or to health care as a whole. However, this masks heterogeneity in
      the bimodal trend in SUDT job postings, with some increases in most years but a
      decrease in 2014 and in 2017, as well as a shift in emphasis between different
      occupational categories. Medicaid expansion, however, is not associated with any 
      statistically significant change in overall hiring attempts in the SUDT related
      sector during this time period, although there is moderate evidence of increases 
      among primary care physicians. Conclusions: Although hiring attempts in the SUDT 
      related sector as measured by the number of job advertisements have not grown
      substantially over time, there was a shift in the hiring landscape. Many national
      factors including reimbursement policy may play a role in incentivizing demand
      for the SUDT related workforce, but our research does not show that recent state 
      Medicaid expansion was one such statistically detectable factor. Future research 
      is needed to understand how aggregate labor demand signals translate into actual 
      increases in SUDT workforce and availability.

TI  - Electroacupuncture Treatment Attenuates Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathic Pain in
      Rats via Inhibiting Spinal Glia and the TLR4/NF-κB Pathway.
PG  - 239-50
AB  - Background and Purpose: Neuropathic pain is a major side-effect of paclitaxel
      (PTX) chemotherapy. Although the precise mechanisms responsible for this pain are
      unclear, the activation of neuroglia and upregulation of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway
      are known to be involved. In this study, we determined whether electroacupuncture
      (EA) could limit mechanical hypersensitivity resulting from the chemotherapeutic 
      drug PTX in rats, and investigated the potential mechanisms involved. Methods:
      Rats intraperitoneally received a cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg PTX (2 mg/kg per
      day) or vehicle control on alternate days (day 0, 2, 4 and 6). EA treatment (10
      Hz, 1 mA) was applied at bilateral ST36 acupoints in rats once every other day on
      days 0–14. For sham EA, needles were inserted at ST36 acupoints without
      electrical stimulation. Mechanical allodynia was measured by mechanical
      withdrawal latency (MWL) of paws to a mechanical stimulus every 2 days. Protein
      expression of TLR4 and NF-κB p65, as well as TMEM119 and GFAP (indicators of
      microglia and astrocytes, respectively) in spinal cord was quantified by Western 
      blot analysis. Levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α in spinal cord
      and serum were detected by ELISA. Results: Mechanical allodynia induced by PTX in
      both paws (right and left) of rats was significantly attenuated by EA but not
      sham EA treatment. In addition, EA, but not sham EA, inhibited the activation of 
      both microglia (TMEM119) and astrocytes (GFAP) in lumbar spinal cord. Moreover,
      Western blot analysis revealed that protein expression of TLR4 and NF-κB in
      spinal cord was suppressed by EA but not sham EA treatment. PTX significantly
      increased inflammatory cytokines in spinal cord and serum, which were ameliorated
      by EA treatment but not by sham EA. Conclusion: These results indicate that EA
      treatment attenuates PTX-induced mechanical allodynia. The putative mechanism
      corroborating this finding could be related to the suppression of activated
      microglia and astrocytes in spinal cord, as well as the inhibition of the
      activated TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway by EA treatment.

TI  - Fetal and Maternal Responses to Dexmedetomidine Intrathecal Application During
      Cesarean Section: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e918523-1-e918523-13
AB  - Background: Intrathecal dexmedetomidine (DEX) can improve the blockade of spinal 
      anesthesia, but there is no clear conclusion on whether it has an effect on the
      fetus during cesarean section. Our meta-analysis evaluated the safety and
      efficacy of intrathecal DEX in cesarean delivery. Material/Methods: We searched
      Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and CBM for eligible studies, and used the Revised
      Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2.0) to assess the risk of bias of each study.
      RevMan was used for statistical analyses. We have registered this meta-analysis
      on PROSPERO (CRD42019120995). Results: The meta-analysis included 10 RCTs, but
      only 5 were prospectively registered. The results of preregistration studies,
      including the 1- or 5-min Apgar score (mean difference [MD], −0.03; 95%
      confidence intervals [CI], −0.16 to 0.10; P=0.64 or MD, 0.00; 95% CI, −0.09 to
      0.09; P=1), the umbilical arterial oxygen or carbon dioxide partial pressure (MD,
      0.90; 95% CI, −4.92 to 6.72; P=0.76 or MD, 1.20; 95% CI, −2.06 to 4.46; P=0.47), 
      and the cord blood pH (MD, −0.01; 95% CI, −0.05 to 0.03; P=0.72), showed that
      intrathecal DEX had no significant difference in neonatal outcomes compared with 
      placebo. In maternal outcomes, intrathecal DEX significantly prolonged
      postoperative pain-free period and reduced the incidence of postoperative
      shivering, which did not increase spinal anesthesia-associated adverse effects.
      Conclusions: Intrathecal DEX is safe for the fetus during cesarean section and
      can improve the blockade effects of spinal anesthesia on puerperae.

TI  - Epigenetics and In Utero Acquired Predisposition to Metabolic Disease.
LID - 1270
AB  - Epidemiological evidence has shown an association between prenatal malnutrition
      and a higher risk of developing metabolic disease in adult life. An inadequate
      intrauterine milieu affects both growth and development, leading to a permanent
      programming of endocrine and metabolic functions. Programming may be due to the
      epigenetic modification of genes implicated in the regulation of key metabolic
      mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs
      (miRNAs). The expression of miRNAs in organs that play a key role in metabolism
      is influenced by in utero programming, as demonstrated by both experimental and
      human studies. miRNAs modulate multiple pathways such as insulin signaling,
      immune responses, adipokine function, lipid metabolism, and food intake. Liver is
      one of the main target organs of programming, undergoing structural, functional, 
      and epigenetic changes following the exposure to a suboptimal intrauterine
      environment. The focus of this review is to provide an overview of the effects of
      exposure to an adverse in utero milieu on epigenome with a focus on the molecular
      mechanisms involved in liver programming.

TI  - Opioid and Polydrug Use Among Patients in Opioid Maintenance Treatment.
PG  - 9-18
AB  - Purpose: Opioid maintenance treatment reduces a person’s use of heroin. However, 
      frequent substance use in treatment is a problem. Aim: To examine the association
      between opioid maintenance treatment and opioid/polydrug use, and whether social 
      factors, adverse experiences, social resources, and quality of life are
      associated with opioid/polydrug use during the first 12 months in treatment.
      Patients and Methods: Forty-seven participants from treatment units in Bergen,
      Norway participated in five waves of data collection. Every third month, a
      structured face-to-face interview collected self-reported data on
      sociodemographic characteristics, opioid/polydrug use, participants’ social
      resources or adverse experiences, and quality of life. Data were collected as
      part of KVARUS, the National Quality Register for Substance Abuse Treatment. A
      multilevel binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the
      association of opioid/polydrug use and time in current treatment. The analysis
      included regressions of opioid/polydrug use on time-invariant baseline adverse
      experiences and social resources, and time-varying reports of quality of life.
      Results: There was a significant negative association between time in treatment
      and use of opioids, b =−0.89, SE = 0.19, p = <0.01. Furthermore, a negative
      association of age at substance use on polydrug use was found, b =−0.40, SE
      =0.19, p = 0.03. A higher overall quality of life was significantly associated
      with lower odds of opioid use during opioid maintenance treatment, b = −0.62, SE 
      = 0.23, p = < 0.01. Social dimensions, participants’ adverse experiences, and
      social resources were not associated with polydrug or opioid use. Conclusion:
      Opioid maintenance treatment is associated with lowered opioid use, but to a
      lesser degree with polydrug use. Our findings add quality of life as an important
      factor that should be given particular attention because it can offer insight to 
      aspects that can affect the patients’ opioid use.

TI  - PRESCRIPTION OPIOID MISUSE MOTIVE LATENT CLASSES: OUTCOMES FROM A NATIONALLY
      REPRESENTATIVE US SAMPLE.
PG  - e97
AB  - Aims:: Prescription opioid misuse (POM) contributes to a larger opioid crisis in 
      the US and Canada, with over 17,000 US POM-related overdose deaths in 2017. Our
      aims were to 1) identify specific profiles of respondents based on POM motives
      using the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and 2) compare
      profile respondents on sociodemographics, substance use and mental and physical
      health outcomes. Methods:: Analyses included 2017-18 NSDUH respondents with data 
      on POM motives (n= 4,810). POM was defined as prescription opioid use in a way
      not intended by the prescriber, including use without a prescription, in larger
      amounts or more frequently. Nine POM motives for the most recent episode were
      assessed, including “to relieve physical pain” and “to get high”. Latent classes,
      based on POM motives, were estimated. Classes were compared on sociodemographics,
      substance use, physical and mental health outcomes. Results:: Eight latent
      classes were identified (in order of prevalence): pain relief only, relax-pain
      relief, sleep-pain relief, multi-motive, high, experimenter, emotional coping,
      and dependent/hooked. Compared to the pain relief only group, the high and
      multi-motive classes had higher odds of all substance use outcomes, with the
      dependent/hooked class having higher odds on all but one outcome. Six of the
      eight classes had higher odds of past-year mental health treatment and suicidal
      ideation than the pain relief only class. Conclusions:: Screening for pain, pain 
      conditions, problematic substance use and psychopathology are recommended in
      those with any POM. While those in the dependent/hooked, multi-motive, and
      emotional coping classes are most likely to have prescription opioid use
      disorder, screening for opioid use disorder symptoms in all individuals with POM 
      is also warranted.

TI  - The identification of risk factors contributing to accidental opioid poisonings
      in companion dogs using data from a North American poison control center
      (2006-2014).
LID - e0227701
AB  - In the last decade, there has been a marked increase in opioid-related human
      deaths in the U.S. However, the effects of the growth in opioid use on vulnerable
      populations, such as pet dogs, are largely unknown. The objective of this study
      was to investigate potential risk factors at the dog, county, and state-levels
      that contributed to accidental dog opioid poisonings. Dog demographic information
      was collected during calls to the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC), operated
      by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, about pet dog
      exposures to poisons from 2006–2014. Data concerning state-level opioid-related
      human death rates and county-level human opioid prescription rates were collected
      from databases accessed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A
      multilevel logistic regression model with random intercepts for county and state 
      was fitted to explore associations between the odds of a call to the APCC being
      related to dog opioid poisonings with the following independent variables: sex,
      weight, age, reproductive status, breed class, year, source of calls,
      county-level human opioid prescription rate, and state-level opioid human death
      rate. There was a significant non-linear positive association between accidental 
      opioid dog poisoning calls and county-level human opioid prescription rates.
      Similarly, the odds of a call being related to an opioid poisoning significantly 
      declined over the study period. Depending on the breed class, the odds of a call 
      being related to an opioid poisoning event were generally lower for older and
      heavier dogs. The odds of a call being related to an opioid poisoning were
      significantly higher for intact compared to neutered dogs, and if the call was
      made by a veterinarian compared to a member of the public. Veterinarians
      responding to poisonings may benefit from knowledge of trends in the use and
      abuse of both legal and illegal drugs in human populations.

TI  - Cannabis Sativa Revisited—Crosstalk between microRNA Expression, Inflammation,
      Oxidative Stress, and Endocannabinoid Response System in Critically Ill Patients 
      with Sepsis.
LID - 307
AB  - Critically ill patients with sepsis require a multidisciplinary approach, as this
      situation implies multiorgan distress, with most of the bodily biochemical and
      cellular systems being affected by the condition. Moreover, sepsis is
      characterized by a multitude of biochemical interactions and by dynamic changes
      of the immune system. At the moment, there is a gap in our understanding of the
      cellular, genetic, and molecular mechanisms involved in sepsis. One of the
      systems intensely studied in recent years is the endocannabinoid signaling
      pathway, as light was shed over a series of important interactions of cannabinoid
      receptors with biochemical pathways, specifically for sepsis. Furthermore, a
      series of important implications on inflammation and the immune system that are
      induced by the activity of cannabinoid receptors stimulated by the
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) have been noticed.
      One of the most important is their ability to reduce the biosynthesis of
      pro-inflammatory mediators and the modulation of immune mechanisms. Different
      studies have reported that cannabinoids can reduce oxidative stress at
      mitochondrial and cellular levels. The aim of this review paper was to present,
      in detail, the important mechanisms modulated by the endocannabinoid signaling
      pathway, as well as of the molecular and cellular links it has with sepsis. At
      the same time, we wish to present the possible implications of cannabinoids in
      the most important biological pathways involved in sepsis, such as inflammation, 
      redox activity, immune system, and epigenetic expression.

TI  - A Census of Medicolegal Death Investigation in the United States: A Need to
      Determine the State of our Nation’s Toxicology Laboratories and Their
      Preparedness for the Current Drug Overdose Epidemic†, ‡.
PG  - 544-9
AB  - In 2007, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported on 2004 data collected from
      the Census of Medical Examiner and Coroner Offices (CMEC). The CMEC was one of
      the first comprehensive reports on the state of the medicolegal death
      investigation system in the United States and included information on
      administration, expenditure, workload, specialized death investigations, records 
      and evidence retention, and resources. However, the report did not include
      responses on questions that were related to toxicology such as specimen retention
      and type of testing. The purpose of this publication is to provide the community 
      with toxicology laboratory‐specific responses from nearly 2000 medical examiner
      and coroner (MEC) offices. Data obtained from a BJS CMEC public use dataset for
      any remaining information that was not reported in the 2007 BJS report were
      evaluated specific to the operation of toxicology laboratories within a MEC
      office or specific to toxicology testing. The CMEC includes information on
      average operating budget for MEC offices with internal or external toxicology
      services, budget for toxicology/microbiology services, respondents’ routine uses 
      of toxicology analysis, toxicology specimen retention time, average turnaround
      times, use of computerized information management systems, and participation in
      federal data collections. These historical data begin to address the present
      state of our nation’s toxicology laboratories within the medicolegal death
      investigation system and their preparedness for the current drug overdose
      epidemic.

TI  - Economic Evaluation of Hepatitis C Treatment Extension to Acute Infection and
      Early-Stage Fibrosis Among Patients Who Inject Drugs in Developing Countries: A
      Case of China.
LID - 800
AB  - We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of (1) treating acute hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) vs. deferring treatment until the chronic phase and (2) treating all
      chronic patients vs. only those with advanced fibrosis; among Chinese genotype 1b
      treatment-naïve patients who injected drugs (PWID), using a combination
      Daclatasvir (DCV) plus Asunaprevir (ASV) regimen and a Peg-interferon
      (PegIFN)-based regimen, respectively. A decision-analytical model including the
      risk of HCV reinfection simulated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
      (QALYs) of three treatment timings, under the DCV+ASV and PegIFN regimen,
      respectively: Treating acute infection (“Treat at acute”), treating chronic
      patients of all fibrosis stages (“Treat at F0 (no fibrosis)”), treating only
      advanced-stage fibrosis patients (“Treat at F3 (numerous septa without
      cirrhosis)”). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to compare 
      scenarios. “Treat at acute” compared with “Treat at F0” was cost-saving (cost:
      DCV+ASV regimen—US$14,486.975 vs. US$16,224.250; PegIFN-based
      regimen—US$19,734.794 vs. US$22,101.584) and more effective (QALY: DCV+ASV
      regimen—14.573 vs. 14.566; PegIFN-based regimen—14.148 vs. 14.116). Compared with
      “Treat at F3”; “Treat at F0” exhibited an ICER of US$3780.20/QALY and
      US$15,145.98/QALY under the DCV+ASV regimen and PegIFN-based regimen;
      respectively. Treatment of acute HCV infection was highly cost-effective and
      cost-saving compared with deferring treatment to the chronic stage; for both
      DCV+ASV and PegIFN-based regimens. Early treatment for chronic patients with
      DCV+ASV regimen was highly cost-effective.

TI  - Prescription Pattern of Drugs Used for Neuropathic Pain and Adherence to NeuPSIG 
      Guidelines in Cancer.
PG  - 13-8
AB  - Objective:: The objective of the present research was to evaluate the
      prescription pattern of the drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of
      cancer-related neuropathic pain (CRNP) and to assess the adherence of the
      physicians to the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) Guidelines.
      Materials and Methods:: This was a cross-sectional, observational study where
      patients who presented to the pain and palliative care outpatient clinic of the
      tertiary care hospital with CRNP were prospectively recruited. Participants were 
      screened for neuropathic pain using DN4 questionnaire. Demographic details,
      diagnosis, medication details, and adherence to NeuPSIG guidelines were assessed 
      using a validated questionnaire. Results:: Of 300 patients screened, 64% were
      male and 36% were female, with a mean age of 48.26 ± 13.05 years. The predominant
      symptoms found were pin-and-needle sensation (99%) followed by tingling sensation
      (98.66%). The most common diagnosis was head-and-neck cancers (37.3%) followed by
      bone cancers (17.3%) and lung cancers (15.3%). Among the first-line drugs
      recommended in NeuPSIG for CRNP, pregabalin (78.7%) was the most common drug
      prescribed followed by amitriptyline (67%). The most common co-prescribed drugs
      were acid suppressants drugs (50.7%). Tapentadol, which is not part of the
      NeuPSIG guidelines, was prescribed on 51 occasions for neuropathic pain.
      Underdosing was observed in 272 prescriptions. Only 12 prescriptions completely
      adhered, while 275 had partial, and 13 prescriptions had poor adherence to
      NeuPSIG guidelines. Conclusion:: The most commonly used drugs in the treatment of
      CRNP were pregabalin and amitriptyline. Most physician partially or did not
      adhere to the NeuPSIG guideline in the management of CRNP.

TI  - Cannabinoids as an Alternative Option for Conventional Analgesics in Cancer Pain 
      Management: A Pharmacogenomics Perspective.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - The global cancer burden is significantly increasing at an alarming rate
      affecting patients, relatives, communities, and health-care system. Cancer
      patients require adequate pain relief and palliative care throughout the life
      course, especially in terminal illness. Although opioid treatment is successful
      in majority of patients, around 40% do not achieve enough analgesia or are prone 
      to serious side effects and toxicity. The treatment of medical conditions with
      cannabis and cannabinoid compounds is constantly expanding. This review organizes
      the current knowledge in the context of SNPs associated with opioids and
      nonopioids and its clinical consequences in pain management and pharmacogenetic
      targets of cannabinoids, for use in clinical practice.

PG  - 145-64
AB  - Hemorrhoidal disease (HD) is the most common proctological disease in the Western
      countries. However, its real prevalence is underestimated due to the frequent
      self-medication.The aim of this consensus statement is to provide evidence-based 
      data to allow an individualized and appropriate management and treatment of HD.
      The strategy used to search for evidence was based on application of electronic
      sources such as MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Review Library, CINAHL, and
      EMBASE.These guidelines are inclusive and not prescriptive.The recommendations
      were defined and graded based on the current levels of evidence and in accordance
      with the criteria adopted by American College of Chest Physicians. The
      recommendations were graded A, B, and C.

TI  - Staphylococcus Aureus Osteomyelitis as an Inducer of Tolerance to Escherichia
      Coli Pyelonephritis: an Experimental Study.
LID - 1345
AB  - The high incidence of osteomyelitis in vulnerable populations like those with
      multiple injuries or elderly undergoing joint arthroplasties generates the
      question what may be their responses to subsequent infection by high virulent
      isolates. Rabbits were subject to two operations at three week intervals; sham
      osteomyelitis and sham pyelonephritis (group S); sham osteomyelitis and
      Escherichia coli pyelonephritis (group P); and Staphylococcus aureus
      osteomyelitis and E. coli pyelonephritis (group OP). Survival was recorded;
      cytokine stimulation of circulating mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tissue
      myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and bacterial growth were monitored. In some
      experiments, dalbavancin treatment was given before pyelonephritis. Healthy PBMCs
      were pre-treated with bone homogenate, S. aureus or both. Mortality of groups S, 
      P and OP after induction of pyelonephritis was 0%, 50% and 8.3% respectively.
      Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) production by PBMCs was significantly lower
      in the OP group at 48 hours. E. coli bacterial load was similar in groups P and
      OP at death or sacrifice whereas the MPO activity of group OP was decreased.
      Production of TNFα was further decreased among dalbavancin treated rabbits; in
      these rabbits tissue MPO was increased. TNFα production decreased when healthy
      PBMCs pre-treated with bone homogenate, S. aureus (HKSA) or both were stimulated 
      with E. coli (HKEC); production was further decreased in the presence of
      anti-TLR4 and anti-TLR9. It is concluded that staphylococcal osteomyelitis
      modulated the innate immune responses of the host leading to protection from
      death by highly virulent E. coli. Tolerance to TLR ligands is the most likely
      mechanism of action.

TI  - Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine in preventing postoperative nausea and
      vomiting in pediatric patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - e0227904
AB  - Background: Intravenous lidocaine in adults undergoing general anesthesia has
      been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
      However, the anti-postoperative vomiting (POV) effect of lidocaine in pediatric
      patients remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with
      Trial Sequential Analysis to evaluate the effect of intravenous lidocaine on
      prevention of POV/PONV. Methods: Six databases including trial registration sites
      were searched. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the incidence of POV/PONV
      after intravenous lidocaine compared with control were included. The primary
      outcome was the incidence of POV within 24 hours after general anesthesia. The
      incidence of POV was combined as a risk ratio with 95% confidence interval using 
      a random-effect model. We used the I2 to assess heterogeneity. We evaluated the
      quality of trials using the Cochrane methodology, and we assessed quality of
      evidence using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and
      Evaluation approach. We also assessed adverse events. Results and discussion: Six
      trials with 849 patients were included, of whom 433 received intravenous
      lidocaine. Three trials evaluated the incidence of POV, and 3 evaluated the
      incidence of PONV. The overall incidence of POV within 24 hours after anesthesia 
      was 45.9% in the lidocaine group and 63.4% in the control group (risk ratio,
      0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–1.00; I2 = 32%; p = 0.05). The incidence of
      PONV within 24 hours after anesthesia was 3.73% in the lidocaine group and 4.87% 
      in the control group (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.36–1.59; I2 = 0%; p = 0.47). The
      quality of evidence was downgraded to “very low” due to the study designs,
      inconsistency, imprecision, and possible publication bias. Conclusion: Our
      meta-analysis suggests that intravenous lidocaine infusion may reduce the
      incidence of POV, however, the evidence quality was “very low.” Further trials
      with a low risk of bias are necessary.

TI  - Neuromuscular blockade in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
LID - 12
AB  - Background: Neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) has been proposed by medical
      guidelines for early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) because of
      its survival benefits. However, new studies have provided evidence contradicting 
      these results. Method: A search was performed of the Pubmed, Scopus,
      Clinicaltrials.gov, and Virtual Health Library databases for randomized
      controlled trials (RCT) evaluating 28-day mortality in ARDS patients treated with
      NMBA within 48 h. An English language restriction was applied. Relevant data were
      extracted and pooled into risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and
      corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effect model.
      Sensitivity and meta-regression analysis were performed. Results: From 2675
      studies, we included five RCTs in the analysis, for a total of 1461 patients with
      a mean PaO2/FIO2 of 104 ± 35 mmHg. The cisatracurium group had the same risk of
      death at 28 days (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78–1.03; I2 = 50%, p = 0.12) and 90 days
      (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62–1.06; I2 = 56%, p = 0.06) as the control group (no
      cisatracurium). The secondary outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration and
      ventilator-free days were not different between the two groups. Cisatracurium had
      a significantly lower risk of barotrauma than the control group with no
      difference in intensive care unit (ICU)–induced weakness. The PaO2/FIO2 ratio was
      higher in the cisatracurium group but not until 48 h. Meta-regression analysis of
      the baseline PaO2/FIO2 ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) revealed no
      heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis excluding the trial using high PEEP and light
      sedation strategy yielded an improvement in all mortality outcomes. Conclusion:
      NMBA improves oxygenation only after 48 h in moderate, severe ARDS patients and
      has a lower barotrauma risk without affecting ICU weakness. However, NMBA does
      not reduce ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation or, most
      importantly, the mortality risk regardless of the severity of ARDS.

TI  - A Collaborative Medication Review Including Deprescribing for Older Patients in
      an Emergency Department: A Longitudinal Feasibility Study.
LID - 348
AB  - Medication review for older patients with polypharmacy in the emergency
      department (ED) is crucial to prevent inappropriate prescribing. Our objective
      was to assess the feasibility of a collaborative medication review in older
      medical patients (≥65 years) using polypharmacy (≥5 long-term medications). A
      pharmacist performed the medication review using the tools: Screening Tool of
      Older Persons’ potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria, a
      drug–drug interaction database (SFINX), and Renbase® (renal dosing database). A
      geriatrician received the medication review and decided which recommendations
      should be implemented. The outcomes were: differences in Medication
      Appropriateness Index (MAI) and Assessment of Underutilization Index (AOU) scores
      between admission and 30 days after discharge and the percentage of patients for 
      which the intervention was completed before discharge. Sixty patients were
      included from the ED, the intervention was completed before discharge for 50
      patients (83%), and 39 (61.5% male; median age 80 years) completed the follow-up 
      30 days after discharge. The median MAI score decreased from 14 (IQR 8-20) at
      admission to 8 (IQR 2-13) 30 days after discharge (p < 0.001). The number of
      patients with an AOU score ≥1 was reduced from 36% to 10% (p < 0.001). Thirty
      days after discharge, 83% of the changes were sustained and for 28 patients
      (72%), 1≥ medication had been deprescribed. In conclusion, a collaborative
      medication review and deprescribing intervention is feasible to perform in the
      ED.

TI  - Palliative Liver Radiotherapy (RT) for Symptomatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma
      (HCC).
LID - 1254
AB  - This study aims at evaluating the symptom response, response duration, and
      toxicity of single dose palliative liver radiotherapy (RT) for symptomatic HCC
      patients. We reviewed unresectable HCC patients treated with palliative RT in our
      institution. Eligible patients were unsuitable or refractory to trans-arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), with an index
      symptom of pain or abdominal discomfort. The primary outcome was the percentage
      of patients with clinical improvement of index symptom at 1 month. Secondary
      outcomes were response duration, toxicities, alpha-feto protein (AFP) response,
      and radiological response. Fifty-two patients were included in the study. The
      index symptom was pain in 34 patients (65.4%), and abdominal discomfort (34.6%)
      in 18 patients. At 1 month, 51.9% of patients had improvement of symptoms. Median
      time to symptom progression was 89 days (range: 12–392 days). Treatment was well 
      tolerated with only 2 patients (3.8%) developing grade 3 GI toxicities. AFP
      response, radiological response rate, and disease control rate at 3 months were
      48.6%, 15.1%, and 54.5% respectively. Half of the patients had improvement of
      index symptoms after receiving palliative liver RT with median response duration 
      of 3 months. The treatment was well tolerated with minimal toxicities.

TI  - Improving opioid guideline adherence: evaluation of a multifaceted,
      theory-informed pilot intervention for family physicians.
LID - e032167
AB  - Objectives: Opioid-related deaths continue to increase in North America, an
      epidemic that was initiated by high rates of opioid prescribing. We designed a
      multifaceted, theory-informed Opioid Self-Assessment (OSA) package, to increase
      adherence to the Canadian Opioid Guideline among family physicians. This study
      aimed to assess changes in Canadian family physicians’ knowledge and practices
      after completing the OSA package. Design: We conducted a mixed-method evaluation 
      using a pre-test and post-test design that involved the collection of both
      qualitative and quantitative data. Setting: This research was conducted in the
      primary care setting in Ontario, Canada. Participants: We recruited a purposive
      sample of nine family physicians in Ontario who use long-term opioid therapy to
      treat patients with chronic pain. Interventions: The OSA package included four
      components: an online knowledge test, an online learning programme, a safe
      medication practice self-assessment questionnaire and chart audit with feedback. 
      Outcome measures: Our measures included changes in knowledge, opioid safety
      practices and physicians’ perspectives on the OSA package. Results: We found
      statistically significant improvements between pre-test and post-test knowledge
      scores at both baseline and 6-month follow-up. Physicians’ scores improved
      significantly on five of the seven core characteristics of the practice
      self-assessment questionnaire. On the chart audits, we observed an improvement in
      patient education between baseline and 6 months. Qualitative interviews showed
      that participants appreciated embedded resources in the OSA package. The
      completion of the package stimulated identification of gaps or deficits in
      practice and served as a useful reminder to discuss risk and safety with
      patients. Participants described the chart review as helpful in prompting
      discussions with their patients, identifying deficits and strengths and a
      ‘primary motivator’ for project participation. Conclusions: The OSA package has
      the potential to improve medication safety practices in primary care related to
      opioid monitoring and adherence to current opioid guidelines.

TI  - Gamified M-Health Attention Bias Modification Intervention for Individuals with
      Opioid Use Disorder: Protocol for a Pilot Randomised Study.
LID - 752
AB  - Introduction: Globally, there is an epidemic of opioid use disorders. Locally, in
      Singapore, there is an increase in the number of individuals abusing opioids. The
      advances in experimental psychology have highlighted the need to modify
      unconscious, automatic biases. These automatic, unconscious biases result in
      individuals having preferential attention to substance-related cues in their
      natural environment, thus leading to a slip or relapse back into their underlying
      addictive disorders. Prior studies have demonstrated not only the presence of
      robust attentional biases amongst individuals with opioid use disorder, even when
      maintained on methadone; and the effectiveness of bias modification amongst these
      individuals. There remains limited evaluation of attention bias modification
      amongst a treatment-seeking cohort of Asian individuals. The objective of this
      pilot is to ensure that the methods of the planned definitive randomized trial
      could be conducted. Methods and Analysis: A non-blinded pilot randomized trial
      will be conducted. A total of 30 participants will be randomized to receive
      either the conventional application or the newly designed co-designed
      application. In order to identify these 30 participants, 60 participants will be 
      recruited and screened to determine if they have baseline biases. Participants
      will be recruited from the inpatient unit at the National Addictions Management
      Service (NAMS) Singapore. All participants who are enrolled into the trial will
      complete a baseline assessment task, and a bias modification assessment and
      modification task daily. They will have to complete a baseline demographic and
      clinical information questionnaire, as well as a cravings rating scale before and
      after the intervention daily. Perspectives—that of self-reported experiences—will
      be sought from the participants following their completion of three intervention 
      tasks. Descriptive statistical analyses will be performed, and chi-square and
      ANOVA analyses will be performed. Qualitative analyses will be undertaken for the
      perspectives shared. Ethics and Dissemination: Ethical approval has been obtained
      from the National Healthcare Group’s Domain Specific Research Board (DSRB)
      (approval number that of 2019/00934). The findings arising from this study will
      be disseminated by means of conferences and publications.

TI  - Unmet needs of patients with cancer in their last year of life as described by
      caregivers in a developing world setting: a qualitative study.
LID - 13
AB  - Background: Palliative care is in its infancy in most of the developing world. We
      set out to explore the lived experiences of families and caregivers of recently
      deceased cancer patients in Trinidad and Tobago and to determine the unmet needs 
      of the patients and what recommendations could be derived to improve the current 
      services. Methods: A phenomenological approach with purposeful sampling was used.
      Participants were referred by key health professionals. Face-to-face interviews
      were conducted. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, with analysis and data
      collection occurring concurrently. Thematic content analysis was used to
      determine common domains, themes and sub-themes. Results: Interviews were
      completed with 15 caregivers. All were spouses or children of the deceased. Ages 
      of the deceased ranged from 43 to 93, the average being 65.5 years. The deceased 
      experienced a variety of cancers including lung, colorectal and oesophageal.Unmet
      needs were identified under 4 domains of institutions, community, the family unit
      and the wider society. Institutional unmet needs were delayed diagnosis and
      treatment and poor inter-institution coordination. Medical and nursing care
      failed in the areas of health care providers’ attitudes, pain management and
      communication. The family unit lacked physical and psychosocial support for the
      caregiver and financial aid for the family unit. Societal needs were for public
      education to address myths and cultural beliefs around cancer. Conclusion: There 
      is need for systemic interventions to improve the care of those dying from cancer
      in Trinidad and Tobago. Stakeholders need to commit to palliative care as a
      public health priority, implementing education, planning services and mobilizing 
      community resources.

TI  - Drivers of the opioid crisis: An appraisal of financial conflicts of interest in 
      clinical practice guideline panels at the peak of opioid prescribing.
LID - e0227045
AB  - Background: Starting in the late 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry sought to
      increase prescribing of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Influencing the
      content of clinical practice guidelines may have been one strategy industry
      employed. In this study we assessed potential risk of bias from financial
      conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry in guidelines for opioid
      prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain published between 2007 and 2013, the peak
      of opioid prescribing. Methods: We used the Guideline Panel Review (GPR) to
      appraise the guidelines included in the 2014 systematic review and critical
      appraisal by Nuckols et al. These were English language opioid prescribing
      guidelines for adults with chronic non-cancer pain published between July 2007
      and July 2013, the peak of opioid prescribing. The GPR assigns red flags to items
      known to introduce potential bias from financial conflicts of interest. We
      operationalized the GPR by creating specific definitions for each red flag. Two
      reviewers independently evaluated each guideline. Disagreements were resolved
      with discussion. We also compared our score to the critical appraisal scores for 
      overall quality from the study by Nuckols et al. Results: We appraised 13
      guidelines, which received 43 red flags in total. Guidelines had 3.3 red flags on
      average (out of a possible seven) with range from one to six. Four guidelines had
      missing information, so red flags may be higher than reported. The guidelines
      with the highest and second highest scores for overall quality in the 2014
      critical appraisal by Nuckols et al. had five and three red flags, respectively. 
      Conclusion: Our findings reveal that the guidelines for opioid prescribing
      chronic non-cancer pain from 2007 to 2013 were at risk of bias because of
      pervasive conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry and a paucity of
      mechanisms to address bias. Even highly-rated guidelines examined in a 2014
      systematic review and critical appraisal had many red flags.

TI  - Unintentional Drug-related Deaths in Cambridgeshire: A Retrospective
      Observational Study.
LID - e6750
AB  - Background: Drug-related deaths are a growing public health problem in the United
      Kingdom, overtaking road fatalities and homicides in terms of annual deaths. In
      this study, we investigated the causes and circumstances of unintentional
      drug-related deaths occurring in the county of Cambridgeshire, with the objective
      of identifying the prevalence of physical, mental, and social health problems
      within this cohort.Methods: We collected data on the demographics and mental and 
      physical health of, and drugs contributing to, 30 consecutive unintentional
      drug-related deaths recorded by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough County
      Council Coroners in 2017. A retrospective observational study was used, and data 
      were collected by manual extraction from coroners’ files.Results: Social
      isolation was identified as a recurring theme amongst the decedents, although
      homelessness was found in very few cases. Pharmacologically, multiple drug
      toxicity and opioid toxicity were highly prevalent, whilst prescription opioids
      were implicated in more cases than heroin. Chronic pain was also highly prevalent
      amongst the decedents, and a history of mental illness was found to occur in the 
      majority of cases.Discussion: Our findings show that reports from the coronial
      system provide a rich narrative to understand the causes of drug-related deaths. 
      We have identified that individuals who die from drug-related deaths frequently
      have multiple adverse physical, mental, and social problems. This implies that
      any attempt to reduce drug-related deaths requires a multi-faceted and
      multi-disciplinary approach.

TI  - Epilepsy Benchmarks Area IV: Limit or Prevent Adverse Consequence of Seizures and
      Their Treatment Across the Life Span.
PG  - 31S-9S
AB  - Epilepsy represents a complex spectrum disorder, with patients sharing seizures
      as a common symptom and manifesting a broad array of additional clinical
      phenotypes. To understand this disorder and treat individuals who live with
      epilepsy, it is important not only to identify pathogenic mechanisms underlying
      epilepsy but also to understand their relationships with other health-related
      factors. Benchmarks Area IV focuses on the impact of seizures and their treatment
      on quality of life, development, cognitive function, and other aspects and
      comorbidities that often affect individuals with epilepsy. Included in this
      review is a discussion on sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and other causes of
      mortality, a major area of research focus with still many unanswered questions.
      We also draw attention to special populations, such as individuals with
      nonepileptic seizures and pregnant women and their offspring. In this study, we
      review the progress made in these areas since the 2016 review of the Benchmarks
      Area IV and discuss challenges and opportunities for future study.

TI  - Heterogeneity in the distribution of 159 drug-response related SNPs in world
      populations and their genetic relatedness.
LID - e0228000
AB  - Interethnic variability in drug response arises from genetic differences
      associated with drug metabolism, action and transport. These genetic variations
      can affect drug efficacy as well as cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We
      retrieved drug-response related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated
      data from databases and analyzed to elucidate population specific distribution of
      159 drug-response related SNPs in twenty six populations belonging to five
      super-populations (African, Admixed Americans, East Asian, European and South
      Asian). Significant interpopulation differences exist in the minor (variant)
      allele frequencies (MAFs), linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype
      distributions among these populations. 65 of the drug-response related alleles,
      which are considered as minor (variant) in global population, are present as the 
      major alleles (frequency ≥0.5) in at least one or more populations. Populations
      that belong to the same super-population have similar distribution pattern for
      majority of the variant alleles. These drug response related variant allele
      frequencies and their pairwise LD measure (r2) can clearly distinguish the
      populations in a way that correspond to the known evolutionary history of human
      and current geographic distributions, while D' cannot. The data presented here
      may aid in identifying drugs that are more appropriate and/or require
      pharmacogenetic testing in these populations. Our findings emphasize on the
      importance of distinct, ethnicity-specific clinical guidelines, especially for
      the African populations, to avoid ADRs and ensure effective drug treatment.

      agonist psychedelics may hold potential in treating a variety of substance use
      disorders (SUDs), including opioid use disorder (OUD). Aims: The study aim was to
      describe and analyze self-reported cases in which naturalistic psychedelic use
      was followed by cessation or reduction in other substance use. Methods: An
      anonymous online survey of individuals reporting cessation or reduction in
      cannabis, opioid, or stimulant use following psychedelic use in non-clinical
      settings. Results: Four hundred forty-four respondents, mostly in the USA (67%)
      completed the survey. Participants reported 4.5 years of problematic substance
      use on average before the psychedelic experience to which they attributed a
      reduction in drug consumption, with 79% meeting retrospective criteria for severe
      SUD. Most reported taking a moderate or high dose of LSD (43%) or
      psilocybin-containing mushrooms (29%), followed by significant reduction in drug 
      consumption. Before the psychedelic experience 96% met SUD criteria, whereas only
      27% met SUD criteria afterward. Participants rated their psychedelic experience
      as highly meaningful and insightful, with 28% endorsing psychedelic-associated
      changes in life priorities or values as facilitating reduced substance misuse.
      Greater psychedelic dose, insight, mystical-type effects, and personal meaning of
      experiences were associated with greater reduction in drug consumption.
      Conclusions: While these cross-sectional and self-report methods cannot determine
      whether psychedelics caused changes in drug use, results suggest the potential
      that psychedelics cause reductions in problematic substance use, and support
      additional clinical research on psychedelic-assisted treatment for SUD.

AB  - Objective: To understand the use of tools, protocols and comfort measures related
      to sedation/analgesia, and to screen the occurrence of delirium in pediatric
      intensive care units. Methods: A survey with 14 questions was distributed by
      e-mail to Brazilian critical care pediatricians. Eight questions addressed
      physician and hospital demographics, and six inquired practices to assess
      sedation, analgesia, and delirium in pediatric intensive care units. Results: Of 
      373 questionnaires sent, 61 were answered (16.3%). The majority of physicians
      were practicing in the Southeast region (57.2%). Of these, 46.5% worked at public
      hospitals, 28.6% of which under direct state administration. Of respondents,
      57.1% used formal protocols for sedation and analgesia, and the Ramsay scale was 
      the most frequently employed (52.5%). Delirium screening scores were not used by 
      48.2% of physicians. The Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium was the score
      most often used (23.2%). The majority (85.7%) of physicians did not practice
      daily sedation interruption, and only 23.2% used non-pharmacological measures for
      patient comfort frequently, with varied participation of parents in the process. 
      Conclusion: This study highlights the heterogeneity of practices for assessment
      of sedation/analgesia and lack of detection of delirium among critical care
      pediatricians in Brazil.

TI  - Direct Anterior Approach Versus Posterolateral Approach for Hemiarthroplasty in
      the Treatment of Displaced Femoral Neck Fractures in Geriatric Patients.
PG  - e919993-1-8
AB  - Background: In the present study, we aimed to evaluate early clinical and
      biochemical outcomes of direct anterior approach (DAA) versus posterolateral
      approach (PLA) for hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of displaced femoral neck
      fractures in geriatric patients. Material/Methods: Between September 2012 and
      September 2017, a total of 110 patients who underwent hemiarthroplasty for
      displaced femoral neck fractures were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were
      divided into 2 groups according to the surgical technique PLA (Group 1, n=54) and
      DAA (Group 2, n=56). Clinical and biochemical results were compared. Results:
      There was no significant difference in the demographic characteristics of the
      patients, fixation type, and follow-up (P>0.05). However, there was a significant
      difference in the duration of surgery, amount of blood transfusion, change from
      baseline in postoperative hemoglobin levels, amount of intraoperative gauze
      dressing, amount of drainage fluid from the surgical wound, postoperative VAS
      scores, incision length, length of hospital stay, and Barthel Index scores in
      favor of DAA group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the degree of
      mobilization (P>0.05). None of the patients had postoperative complications in
      Group 1, while 3 patients in Group 2 developed a lateral femoral cutaneous nerve 
      lesion and one patient had a missed iatrogenic fracture of the greater
      trochanter. Conclusions: Our study results suggest that early clinical and
      biochemical outcomes are better in DAA than PLA with early return to daily living
      activities in patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty for displaced femoral neck
      fractures.

TI  - Interventions for incarcerated adults with opioid use disorder in the United
      States: A systematic review with a focus on social determinants of health.
LID - e0227968
AB  - Incarceration poses significant health risks for people involved in the criminal 
      justice system. As the world’s leader in incarceration, the United States
      incarcerated population is at higher risk for infectious diseases, mental
      illness, and substance use disorder. Previous studies indicate that the mortality
      rate for people coming out of prison is almost 13 times higher than that of the
      general population; opioids contribute to nearly 1 in 8 post-release fatalities
      overall, and almost half of all overdose deaths. Given the hazardous intersection
      of incarceration, opioid use disorder, and social determinants of health, we
      systematically reviewed recent evidence on interventions for opioid use disorder 
      (OUD) implemented as part of United States criminal justice system involvement,
      with an emphasis on social determinants of health (SDOH). We searched academic
      literature to identify eligible studies of an intervention for OUD that was
      implemented in the context of criminal justice system involvement (e.g.,
      incarceration or parole/probation) for adults ages 19 and older. From 6,604
      citations, 13 publications were included in final synthesis. Most interventions
      were implemented in prisons (n = 6 interventions), used medication interventions 
      (n = 10), and did not include SDOH as part of the study design (n = 8).
      Interventions that initiated medication treatment early and throughout
      incarceration had significant, positive effects on opioid use outcomes. Evidence 
      supports medication treatment administered throughout the period of criminal
      justice involvement as an effective method of improving post-release outcomes in 
      individuals with criminal justice involvement. While few studies included SDOH
      components, many investigators recognized SDOH needs as competing priorities
      among justice-involved individuals. This review suggests an evidence gap;
      evidence-based interventions that address OUD and SDOH in the context of criminal
      justice involvement are urgently needed.

TI  - Integrated miRNA-/mRNA-Seq of the Habenulo-Interpeduncular Circuit During Acute
      Nicotine Withdrawal.
LID - 813
AB  - Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of mortality in the world. The
      limited number of smoking cessation aids currently available are minimally
      effective, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic interventions. We describe
      a genome-wide approach to identify potential candidates for such interventions.
      Next-generation sequencing was performed using RNA isolated from the
      habenulo-interpeduncular circuit of male mice withdrawn from chronic nicotine
      treatment. This circuit plays a central role in the nicotine withdrawal response.
      Differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs were validated using RT-qPCR. Many of
      the differentially expressed mRNAs are predicted targets of reciprocally
      expressed miRNAs. We illustrate the utility of the dataset by demonstrating that 
      knockdown in the interpeduncular nucleus of a differentially expressed mRNA, that
      encoding profilin 2, is sufficient to induce anxiety-related behavior.
      Importantly, profilin 2 knockdown in the ventral tegmental area did not affect
      anxiety behavior. Our data reveal wide-spread changes in gene expression within
      the habenulo-interpeduncular circuit during nicotine withdrawal. This dataset
      should prove to be a valuable resource leading to the identification of
      substrates for the design of innovative smoking cessation aids.

TI  - Epidemiology of knee osteoarthritis in general practice: a registry-based study.
LID - e031734
AB  - Objectives: The present study investigated (1) trends in the prevalence and
      incidence of knee osteoarthritis over a 20-year period (1996–2015); (2) trends in
      multimorbidity and (3) trends in drug prescriptions. Design: Registry-based
      study. Setting: Primary healthcare, Flanders, Belgium. Participants: Data were
      collected from Intego, a general practice-based morbidity registration network.
      In the study period between 1996 and 2015, data from 440 140 unique patients were
      available. Outcome measures: Trends in prevalence and incidence rate of knee
      osteoarthritis were computed using joinpoint regression analysis. The mean
      disease count was calculated to assess trends in multimorbidity. In addition, the
      number of drug prescriptions was identified by the Anatomical Therapeutic
      Chemical Classification code and trends were equally recorded with joinpoint
      regression. Results: The total age-standardised prevalence of knee osteoarthritis
      increased from 2.0% in 1996 to 3.6% in 2015. An upward trend was observed with an
      average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 2.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 2.9). In 2015, the 
      prevalence rates in the 10 year age groups from the 45–54 years age group onwards
      were 3.1%, 5.6%, 9.0% and 13.9%, to reach 15.0% in people aged 85 years and
      older. The incidence remained stable with 3.75‰ in 2015 (AAPC=−0.5, 95% CI −1.4
      to 0.5). The mean disease count significantly increased from 1.63 to 2.34
      (p<0.001) for incident cases with knee osteoarthritis. Finally, we observed a
      significantly positive trend in the overall prescription of acetaminophen
      (AAPC=6.7, 95% CI 5.6 to 7.7), weak opioids (AAPC=4.0, 95% CI 0.9 to 7.3) and
      glucosamine (AAPC=8.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 15.1). Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs were most prescribed, with a prevalence rate of 29.8% in 2015, but remained
      stable during the study period (AAPC=0.0, 95% CI −1.1 to 1.1). Conclusions:
      Increased prevalence, multimorbidity, and number of drug prescriptions confirm an
      increased burden of knee osteoarthritis. In future, these trends can be used to
      prioritise initiatives for improvement in care.

TI  - Diagnosis of Acute Mesenteric Ischemia in a Patient with End-Stage Renal Disease 
      with Normal Serum Lactate.
LID - e6708
AB  - Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening vascular emergency and a
      diagnostic challenge for physicians. It represents a group of pathophysiologic
      processes that have a common end point, that is, bowel infarction, and has a
      nonspecific clinical picture and a high mortality rate. The most common
      underlying etiologies are arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, nonocclusive
      mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), and mesenteric venous thrombosis. NOMI is caused by
      prolonged functional vasoconstriction of the visceral arterial vessels, leading
      to progressive intestinal ischemia, and could be defined by the absence of
      atherosclerotic thrombotic or embolic occlusion of the mesenteric arteries. The
      pathophysiology of NOMI remains poorly understood. It can occur in a wide range
      of critical systemic illnesses associated with hypotension and hypovolemia and in
      patients on hemodialysis. Elevation of serum lactate may not be present in a
      significant portion of patients with AMI, which creates an additional obstacle to
      the prompt diagnosis and often delays treatment. We present a case of a
      35-year-old female with HIV and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who was
      admitted for complaints of vague nonspecific abdominal pain. Her initial lactic
      acid was normal, and due to renal function, she underwent CT of the chest and
      abdomen without contrast, which only revealed findings consistent with chronic
      constipation. She later developed vasopressor-dependent hypotension, but her
      serial lactic acids were all normal. Finally, CT of the abdomen and pelvis was
      performed with IV contrast, with findings of enterocolitis of the ileum and
      proximal ascending colon. There was also evidence of pneumatosis involving
      dilated loops of the small bowel in the lateral mid-abdomen. She underwent an
      exploratory laparotomy and was found to have gangrene of terminal ileum with
      associated perforation. Small bowel resection was performed, after which the
      patient clinically stabilized.

TI  - New drugs are not enough-drug repositioning in oncology: An update.
PG  - 651-84
AB  - Drug repositioning refers to the concept of discovering novel clinical benefits
      of drugs that are already known for use treating other diseases. The advantages
      of this are that several important drug characteristics are already established
      (including efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity), making the
      process of research for a putative drug quicker and less costly. Drug
      repositioning in oncology has received extensive focus. The present review
      summarizes the most prominent examples of drug repositioning for the treatment of
      cancer, taking into consideration their primary use, proposed anticancer
      mechanisms and current development status.

TI  - Comparing the prophylactic effects of oral gabapentin, pregabalin, and celecoxib 
      on postoperative pain management in orthopedic surgery of the lower extremity: A 
      double-blind randomized controlled trial.
LID - 9
AB  - Background:: Lower extremity pain after orthopedic surgery is so frequent that
      has led to many treatment modalities. This study aims to compare the prophylactic
      effects of oral gabapentin, pregabalin, and celecoxib on reducing postsurgical
      pain of the lower extremity orthopedic surgery. Materials and Methods:: In a
      double-blind randomized controlled trial, 120 patients were randomly divided into
      four groups using block design randomization. 1 h before spinal anesthesia, the
      studied groups received 300 mg oral gabapentin; 75 mg oral pregabalin; 200 mg
      oral celecoxib; and starch as placebo. The severity of postoperative pain (using 
      visual analog scale), mean arterial pressure, heart rate, opioid consumption
      dose, and drug side effects were recorded for six times (each 60 min up to two
      times and then every 6 h for the next four times). Chi-square, one-way analysis
      of variance (ANOVA), and ANOVA repeated measure tests were used for statistical
      analysis. Results:: Significant reduction of pain severity was observed only at
      the first time measurement between pregabalin and placebo groups (P: 0.014).
      Patients in the pregabalin group required lower dose of opioid compared to
      placebo group during admission in surgical ward. There were no significant
      differences concerning pain reduction, opioid administration, and side effects
      between pregabalin, gabapentin, and celecoxib groups. Conclusion:: Taking 75 mg
      oral pregabalin before lower extremity orthopedic surgery can attenuate
      postoperative pain, especially during the 1st h postoperation as well as less
      opioid consumption and much more patients' satisfaction.

TI  - Routes of non-traditional entry into buprenorphine treatment programs.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: Excessive prescribing, increased potency of opioids, and increased
      availability of illicit heroin and synthetic analogs such as fentanyl has
      resulted in an increase of overdose fatalities. Medications for opioid use
      disorder (MOUD) significantly reduces the risk of overdose when compared with no 
      treatment. Although the use of buprenorphine as an agonist treatment for opioid
      use disorder (OUD) is growing significantly, barriers remain which can prevent or
      delay treatment. In this study we examine non-traditional routes which could
      facilitate entry into buprenorphine treatment programs. Methods: Relevant,
      original research publications addressing entry into buprenorphine treatment
      published during the years 1989–2019 were identified through PubMed, PsychInfo,
      PsychArticles, and Medline databases. We operationalized key terms based on three
      non-traditional paths: persons that entered treatment via the criminal justice
      system, following emergencies, and through community outreach. Results: Of 462
      screened articles, twenty studies met the inclusion criteria for full review.
      Most studies were from the last several years, and most (65%) were from the
      Northeastern region of the United States. Twelve (60%) were studies suggesting
      that the criminal justice system could be a potentially viable entry route, both 
      pre-release or post-incarceration. The emergency department was also found to be 
      a cost-effective and viable route for screening and identifying individuals with 
      OUD and linking them to buprenorphine treatment. Fewer studies have documented
      community outreach initiatives involving buprenorphine. Most studies were small
      sample size (mean = < 200) and 40% were randomized trials. Conclusions: Despite
      research suggesting that increasing the number of Drug Addiction Treatment Act
      (DATA) waived physicians who prescribe buprenorphine would help with the opioid
      treatment gap, little research has been conducted on routes to increase
      utilization of treatment. In this study, we found evidence that engaging
      individuals through criminal justice, emergency departments, and community
      outreach can serve as non-traditional treatment entry points for certain
      populations. Alternative routes could engage a greater number of people to
      initiate MOUD treatment.

TI  - Morphine plasmatic concentration in a pregnant mare and its foal after long term 
      epidural administration.
LID - 19
AB  - Background: Epidural administration of morphine has been shown to be an effective
      analgesic strategy in horses; however, the possible occurrence of side effects
      limits its usage. In order to decrease their frequency, it is important to target
      the minimal effective plasma concentration and avoid overdosing. As to date
      species-specific pharmacokinetics data are not available for epidural morphine,
      the dosing regimen is usually established on the basis of clinical reports and
      personal experience. In certain physiological conditions, like gestation, the
      outcome of an empirical dosing scheme can be unpredictable. The aim of this case 
      report is to describe the pharmacological profile of morphine and its metabolites
      after prolonged epidural administration in a pregnant mare and her foal. Case
      presentation: A 20 years old pregnant mare was presented to our hospital because 
      of severe lameness, 2 months before delivery. Following an ineffective systemic
      pain treatment, an epidural catheter was inserted and morphine administered
      (initial dose 0.1 mg/kg every 8 h). Due to its efficacy in controlling pain, it
      was continued until end of gestation. Plasmatic concentration of morphine and its
      metabolites were assessed in the mare 6 weeks after starting the treatment, and
      in both the mare and foal during the first days after delivery. Plasmatic values 
      similar to those previously reported in the literature following morphine short
      term administration through various routes and not accompanied by side effects
      were found in the mare, except during an excitatory period. Moreover, no evidence
      of dangerous drug accumulation or significant milk passage was noticed in the
      foal. Mild reduction of feces production with no signs of colic and two
      self-limiting episodes of excitement occurred during treatment in the mare. No
      side effects occurred during gestation and first phases of life in the foal.
      Conclusion: Prolonged epidural administration of morphine in a pregnant mare
      allowed good pain control in absence of clinically relevant side effects, in both
      the mare and her foal. Sudden increase in morphine plasmatic concentration can
      occur and side effects appear; careful treatment to the lowest effective dose and
      continuous monitoring of the clinical condition of the treated horse should be
      performed.

TI  - Risk factors for prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay among patients
      with acute drug overdose in Japan.
LID - e482
AB  - Aim: Hospital selection for patients with drug overdose (DOD) is a critical
      issue. In Tokyo, the 50‐tablet rule has been widely utilized by paramedics for
      triaging patients with DOD given that it shortens the triage time. However,
      studies have not investigated the utility of such a rule in local cities. The
      present study aimed to identify prognostic pre‐ and in‐hospital factors among
      patients with DOD and determine whether the 50‐tablet rule benefits local cities.
      Methods: Clinical records of patients with DOD admitted at the University of
      Tsukuba Hospital (Tsukuba, Japan) between 2013 and 2017 were retrospectively
      reviewed. Results: A total of 93 patients with DOD were enrolled in this study.
      Multivariate analysis showed that creatine kinase and C‐reactive protein values
      and the total number of ingested pills were in‐hospital risk factors that
      significantly prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay. Moreover,
      Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission and the total number of ingested pills were
      identified as significant pre‐hospital risk factors for prolonged ICU and
      hospital stay. Setting the total number of ingested pills to 50 tablets did not
      significantly influence ICU and hospital stay. Conclusion: The total number of
      ingested pills and creatine kinase and C‐reactive protein values were identified 
      as predictive factors for prolonged ICU and hospital stay in patients with DOD
      after admission. Moreover, pre‐hospital risk factors included Glasgow Coma Scale 
      score and the total number of ingested pills. However, the 50‐tablet rule was
      determined to be a poor cut‐off value for patients with DOD. We presented a
      subset of our findings at the 46th annual meeting of the Japanese Society for
      Acute Medicine (Yokohama, Japan) on 20 November 2018.

TI  - Re-prioritizing traffic stops to reduce motor vehicle crash outcomes and racial
      disparities.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: Law enforcement traffic stops are one of the most common entryways to
      the US justice system. Conventional frameworks suggest traffic stops promote
      public safety by reducing dangerous driving practices and non-vehicular crime.
      Law enforcement agencies have wide latitude in enforcement, including
      prioritization of stop types: (1) safety (e.g. moving violation) stops, (2)
      investigatory stops, or (3) economic (regulatory and equipment) stops. In order
      to prevent traffic crash fatalities and reduce racial disparities, the police
      department of Fayetteville, North Carolina significantly re-prioritized safety
      stops. Methods: Annual traffic stop, motor vehicle crash, and crime data from
      2002 to 2016 were combined to examine intervention (2013–2016) effects.
      Fayetteville was compared against synthetic control agencies built from 8 similar
      North Carolina agencies by weighted matching on pre-intervention period trends
      and comparison against post-intervention trends. Results: On average over the
      intervention period as compared to synthetic controls, Fayetteville increased
      both the number of safety stops + 121% (95% confidence interval + 17%, + 318%)
      and the relative proportion of safety stops (+ 47%). Traffic crash and injury
      outcomes were reduced, including traffic fatalities − 28% (− 64%, + 43%),
      injurious crashes − 23% (− 49%, + 16%), and total crashes − 13% (− 48%, + 21%).
      Disparity measures were reduced, including Black percent of traffic stops − 7%
      (− 9%, − 5%) and Black vs. White traffic stop rate ratio − 21% (− 29%, − 13%). In
      contrast to the Ferguson Effect hypothesis, the relative de-prioritization of
      investigatory stops was not associated with an increase in non-traffic crime
      outcomes, which were reduced or unchanged, including index crimes − 10% (− 25%,
      + 8%) and violent crimes − 2% (− 33%, + 43%). Confidence intervals were estimated
      using a different technique and, given small samples, may be asymmetrical.
      Conclusions: The re-prioritization of traffic stop types by law enforcement
      agencies may have positive public health consequences both for motor vehicle
      injury and racial disparity outcomes while having little impact on non-traffic
      crime.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA H19 in the injured dorsal root ganglion contributes to
      peripheral nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity.
PG  - 176-84
AB  - Peripheral nerve injury-induced changes in gene transcription and translation in 
      the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) play a critical role in the development and
      maintenance of neuropathic pain. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene
      expression. Here, we report that peripheral nerve injury caused by ligation of
      the fourth spinal nerve (SNL) led to a time-dependent increase in the expression 
      in H19, an lncRNA, in the injured DRG. Microinjection of a specific H19 siRNA,
      but not negative control scrambled siRNA, into the injured DRG 4 days before SNL 
      alleviated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia on days 3 and 5
      post-SNL. Additionally, DRG microinjection of the H19 siRNA on day 7 after SNL
      reduced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia on days 10 and 12 post-SNL.
      DRG microinjection of neither siRNA affected locomotor activity and acute basal
      responses to mechanical and thermal stimuli. Our findings suggest that H19
      participates in the peripheral mechanism underlying the development and
      maintenance of neuropathic pain. H19 may be a potential target for treatment of
      this disorder.

TI  - The Role of CYP450 Drug Metabolism in Precision Cardio-Oncology.
LID - 604
AB  - As many novel cancer therapies continue to emerge, the field of Cardio-Oncology
      (or onco-cardiology) has become crucial to prevent, monitor and treat cancer
      therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity. Furthermore, given the narrow
      therapeutic window of most cancer therapies, drug-drug interactions are prevalent
      in the cancer population. Consequently, there is an increased risk of affecting
      drug efficacy or predisposing individual patients to adverse side effects. Here
      we review the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes in the field of
      Cardio-Oncology. We highlight the importance of cardiac medications in preventive
      Cardio-Oncology for high-risk patients or in the management of cardiotoxicities
      during or following cancer treatment. Common interactions between Oncology and
      Cardiology drugs are catalogued, emphasizing the impact of differential
      metabolism of each substrate drug on unpredictable drug bioavailability and
      consequent inter-individual variability in treatment response or development of
      cardiovascular toxicity. This inter-individual variability in bioavailability and
      subsequent response can be further enhanced by genomic variants in CYP450, or by 
      modifications of CYP450 gene, RNA or protein expression or function in various
      ‘omics’ related to precision medicine. Thus, we advocate for an individualized
      approach to each patient by a multidisciplinary team with clinical pharmacists
      evaluating a treatment plan tailored to a practice of precision Cardio-Oncology. 
      This review may increase awareness of these key concepts in the rapidly evolving 
      field of Cardio-Oncology.

TI  - New Perspective in Diabetic Neuropathy: From the Periphery to the Brain, a Call
      for Early Detection, and Precision Medicine.
LID - 929
AB  - Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common chronic complication of diabetes
      mellitus. It leads to distressing and expensive clinical sequelae such as foot
      ulceration, leg amputation, and neuropathic pain (painful-DPN). Unfortunately,
      DPN is often diagnosed late when irreversible nerve injury has occurred and its
      first presentation may be with a diabetic foot ulcer. Several novel diagnostic
      techniques are available which may supplement clinical assessment and aid the
      early detection of DPN. Moreover, treatments for DPN and painful-DPN are limited.
      Only tight glucose control in type 1 diabetes has robust evidence in reducing the
      risk of developing DPN. However, neither glucose control nor pathogenetic
      treatments are effective in painful-DPN and symptomatic treatments are often
      inadequate. It has recently been hypothesized that using various patient
      characteristics it may be possible to stratify individuals and assign them
      targeted therapies to produce better pain relief. We review the diagnostic
      techniques which may aid the early detection of DPN in the clinical and research 
      environment, and recent advances in precision medicine techniques for the
      treatment of painful-DPN.

TI  - Opioids Impair Intestinal Epithelial Repair in HIV-Infected Humanized Mice.
LID - 2999
AB  - Intestinal barrier dysfunction and subsequent microbial translocation play
      crucial roles in persistent immune activation leading to HIV disease progression.
      Opioid use is associated with worse outcome in HIV-infected patients. The
      exacerbated disease progression by opioids is mainly driven by excessive
      intestinal inflammation and increased gut permeability. The objective of this
      study is to investigate how opioids potentiate HIV disease progression by
      compromising intestinal barrier function and impairing intestinal epithelial
      self-repair mechanism. In the present study, abnormal intestinal morphology and
      reduced epithelial proliferation were observed in bone marrow-liver-thymus
      humanized mice and in HIV-infected patients who were exposed to opioids. In bone 
      marrow-liver-thymus mice, HIV, and morphine independently, and additively induced
      gut dysbiosis, especially depletion of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and
      Muribaculaceae. We also observed that the abundance of Lachnospiraceae,
      Ruminococcaceae, and Muribaculaceae negatively correlated with apoptosis of
      epithelial cells, and intestinal IL-6 levels. Previous studies have shown that
      these bacterial families play crucial roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis
      because they include most short-chain fatty acid-producing members. Short-chain
      fatty acids have been shown to maintain stem cell populations and suppress
      inflammation in the gut by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDAC). In addition,
      we demonstrate that morphine exposure inhibited growth of intestinal organoids
      derived from HIV transgenic mice by suppressing Notch signaling in an
      HDAC-dependent manner. These studies implicate an important role for HDAC in
      intestinal homeostasis and supports HDAC modulation as a therapeutic intervention
      in improving care of HIV patients, especially in opioid-abusing population.

TI  - The Risks and Outcomes Resulting From Medication Errors Reported in the Finnish
      Tertiary Care Units:: A Cross-Sectional Retrospective Register Study.
LID - 1571
AB  - Background: Hospital-acquired medication errors (MEs) are common in health care. 
      Although voluntary reporting is criticized for not producing reliable estimates
      on ME frequency, it provides valuable knowledge on errors occurring in the
      medication process.Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze and
      determine the risks and outcomes resulting from MEs related to the TOP15
      medicines in the Finnish tertiary care units from July 2016 to July 2017.Methods:
      The data consisting of 1,447 ME reports was organized according to ATC
      classification, after which TOP15 medicines involved in the reports were
      selected. Inductive content analysis was performed to the reports. After this,
      the reports were categorized by ME outcome into five categories and further
      analyzed accordingly.Results: The most common ME outcome in the reports was
      “omitted medicine” (33.9%). More than a quarter (27.1%) of ME reports were
      estimated to cause moderate or severe risk to the patient. When compared with
      each other, none of the outcome groups were more susceptible to high-risk events 
      (p = 0.71). Of the TOP15 medicines, only Norepinephrine had significantly higher 
      risk of being involved in high-risk events (OR 2.43, 95%CI 1.35–4.61).Conclusion:
      Voluntary reporting has an important role in the development of medication safety
      and the overall medication process within organizations. Although majority of the
      TOP15 medicines were involved in MEs resulting in seemingly high-risk outcomes,
      they were estimated to be insignificant or minor within the reporting unit. In
      the future, more emphasis will be needed for the assessment and analysis of the
      reports for more efficient, real-time detection and response to signals from
      health care units.

TI  - Socioeconomic risk factors for fatal opioid overdoses in the United States:
      Findings from the Mortality Disparities in American Communities Study (MDAC).
LID - e0227966
AB  - Background: Understanding relationships between individual-level demographic,
      socioeconomic status (SES) and U.S. opioid fatalities can inform interventions in
      response to this crisis. Methods: The Mortality Disparities in American Community
      Study (MDAC) links nearly 4 million 2008 American Community Survey responses to
      the 2008–2015 National Death Index. Univariate and multivariable models were used
      to estimate opioid overdose fatality hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CI). Results: Opioid overdose was an overrepresented cause of death
      among people 10 to 59 years of age. In multivariable analysis, compared to
      Hispanics, Whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives had elevated risk (HR =
      2.52, CI:2.21–2.88) and (HR = 1.88, CI:1.35–2.62), respectively. Compared to
      women, men were at-risk (HR = 1.61, CI:1.50–1.72). People who were disabled were 
      at higher risk than those who were not (HR = 2.80, CI:2.59–3.03). Risk was higher
      among widowed than married (HR = 2.44, CI:2.03–2.95) and unemployed than employed
      individuals (HR = 2.46, CI:2.17–2.79). Compared to adults with graduate degrees, 
      those with high school only were at-risk (HR = 2.48, CI:2.00–3.06). Citizens were
      more likely than noncitizens to die from this cause (HR = 4.62, CI:3.48–6.14).
      Compared to people who owned homes with mortgages, those who rented had higher
      HRs (HR = 1.36, CI:1.25–1.48). Non-rural residents had higher risk than rural
      residents (HR = 1.46, CI:1.34, 1.59). Compared to respective referent groups,
      people without health insurance (HR = 1.30, CI:1.20–1.41) and people who were
      incarcerated were more likely to die from opioid overdoses (HR = 2.70,
      CI:1.91–3.81). Compared to people living in households at least five-times above 
      the poverty line, people who lived in poverty were more likely to die from this
      cause (HR = 1.36, CI:1.20–1.54). Compared to people living in West North Central 
      states, HRs were highest among those in South Atlantic (HR = 1.29, CI:1.11, 1.50)
      and Mountain states (HR = 1.58, CI:1.33, 1.88). Discussion: Opioid fatality was
      associated with indicators of low SES. The findings may help to target
      prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts to vulnerable groups.

TI  - Outpatient narcotic consumption following total shoulder arthroplasty.
PG  - 100-4
AB  - Introduction: In the setting of the opioid epidemic, physicians continue to
      scrutinize ways to minimize exposure to narcotic medications. Several studies
      emphasize improvements in perioperative pain management following total shoulder 
      arthroplasty (TSA). However, there is a paucity of literature describing
      outpatient narcotic consumption requirements following TSA. Methods: A
      single-institution, prospective study of patients undergoing primary TSA was
      performed. Preoperative demographics including exposure to narcotics, smoking
      history, and alcohol exposure were collected. The primary outcome was measurement
      of total outpatient narcotic consumption 6 weeks from surgery. Narcotic
      consumption was verified by counting leftover pills at the final follow-up visit.
      Results: Overall, 50 patients were enrolled. The median narcotic consumption in
      the cohort was 193 morphine equivalent units (MEUs), approximately 25 (5-mg)
      tablets of oxycodone, and the mean consumption was 246 MEUs, approximately 32
      (5-mg) tablets. Almost 25% of patients consumed fewer than 10 total tablets, with
      10% of patients taking no narcotics at home. Multivariate regression found
      preoperative narcotic exposure associated with increased consumption of 31 MEUs
      (P = .004). Older age was found to be protective of narcotic consumption, with
      increasing age by 1 year associated with 0.75 MEU decrease in consumption (P =
      .04). Conclusions: Anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty in general provides
      quick, reliable pain relief and does not require a significant amount of narcotic
      medication postoperatively. For most patients, it is reasonable to prescribe the 
      equivalent of 25-30 (5-mg) oxycodone tablets following TSA.

TI  - Fluoroscopy-Guided Percutaneous Sacroplasty for Painful Metastases at the Sacral 
      Ala.
PG  - 151-6
AB  - Objective: Percutaneous sacroplasty (PSP) is widely used in the clinic for
      osteoporotic sacral insufficiency fractures; however, few reports have described 
      the safety and effectiveness of PSP for painful sacral metastases at the sacral
      ala under fluoroscopy alone. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      fluoroscopy-guided PSP for painful metastases at the sacral ala. Patients and
      Methods: Thirty-five consecutive patients (median age, 60.74 ± 12.74 years), with
      a total of 41 metastatic lesions at the sacral ala, were treated with PSP. The
      patients were followed up for periods ranging from 1 month to 30 months (average,
      8.23 ± 6.75 months). The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index
      (ODI), and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) were used to evaluate pain,
      mobility, and quality of life before the procedure and at 3 days and 1, 3, 6, 12,
      and 18 months after the procedure. Results: Technical success was achieved in all
      patients. The minimum follow-up duration was 1 month. The mean VAS scores
      declined significantly from 7.20 ± 0.93 before the procedure to 3.43 ± 1.38 by
      day 3 after the procedure, and was 3.13 ± 1.07 at 1 month, 3.17 ± 1.15 at 3
      months, 2.91± 1.38 at 6 months, and 2.57 ± 1.51 at 12 months after the procedure 
      (P < 0.001). After PSP, analgesic drug administration had been discontinued in 31
      of 35 patients (88.57%). The ODI and KPS also changed after PSP, with significant
      differences between the baseline scores and those at each follow-up examination
      (P < 0.001). Extraosseous cement leakage occurred in 12 cases without any major
      clinical complications. Conclusion: PSP is a safe and effective technique for the
      palliative treatment of painful metastases involving the sacral ala under
      fluoroscopic guidance alone. It can relieve pain, reduce disability, and improve 
      function, and is associated with minimal complications.

TI  - Incidence of Opioid Overdose Among Patients Using ER/LA Opioid Analgesics Before 
      and After Implementation of the Class-Wide Opioid Risk Evaluation and Mitigation 
      Strategy.
PG  - 157-69
AB  - Introduction: The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required 
      a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and
      long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics on 09 July 2012. Methods: This study
      compared the incidence of opioid overdose before (July 2010-June 2012) and after 
      (July 2013-September 2016) the initiation of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
      Strategy (REMS) for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics.
      We identified patients with ≥1 ER/LA opioid dispensing in either time period in
      national data from the HealthCore Integrated Research DatabaseSM (HIRD) and in
      United States (US) Medicaid claims data from four states. We described each
      population, calculated the incidence rate (IR) of opioid overdose, and assessed
      crude and propensity score adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing the
      overdose rate after vs before implementation of the REMS. Results: A total of
      121,229 commercially insured and 11,488 Medicaid patients were included in the
      analysis. Rates of overdose were substantially higher in Medicaid patients than
      in the commercially insured patients (IR 192.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      162.60–225.18 versus 102.60, 95% CI 93.0–112.93 in the active period). The IRRs
      for opioid overdose were 1.01 (95% CI 0.87–1.17) in the commercially insured
      population and 0.70 (95% CI 0.52–0.93) in Medicaid. Conclusion: This leveling off
      of overdose rates among commercially insured patients and decline among Medicaid 
      patients is encouraging, but it is difficult to disentangle the specific impact
      of the REMS from many other ongoing initiatives with similar goals.

TI  - Developing a clinical decision support for opioid use disorders: a NIDA center
      for the clinical trials network working group report.
LID - 4
AB  - There is an urgent need for strategies to address the US epidemic of prescription
      opioid, heroin and fentanyl-related overdoses, misuse, addiction, and diversion. 
      Evidence-based treatment such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are
      available but lack numbers of providers offering these services to meet the
      demands. Availability of electronic health record (EHR) systems has greatly
      increased and led to innovative quality improvement initiatives but this has not 
      yet been optimized to address the opioid epidemic or to treat opioid use disorder
      (OUD). This report from a clinical decision support (CDS) working group convened 
      by the NIDA Center for the Clinical Trials Network aims to converge electronic
      technology in the EHR with the urgent need to improve screening, identification, 
      and treatment of OUD in primary care settings through the development of a CDS
      algorithm that could be implemented as a tool in the EHR. This aim is consistent 
      with federal, state and local government and private sector efforts to improve
      access and quality of MOUD treatment for OUD, existing clinical quality and HEDIS
      measures for OUD or drug and alcohol use disorders, and with a recent draft grade
      B recommendation from the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) for
      screening for illicit drug use in adults when appropriate diagnosis, treatment
      and care services can be offered or referred. Through a face-to-face expert panel
      meeting and multiple follow-up conference calls, the working group drafted CDS
      algorithms for clinical care felt to be essential for screening, diagnosis, and
      management of OUD in primary care. The CDS algorithm was reviewed by addiction
      specialists and primary care providers and revised based on their input. A
      clinical decision support tool for OUD screening, assessment, and treatment
      within primary care systems may help improve healthcare delivery to help address 
      the current epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose that has outpaced the capacity
      of specialized treatment settings. A semi-structured outline of clinical decision
      support for OUD was developed to facilitate implementation within the EHR.
      Further work for adaptation at specific sites and for testing is needed.

TI  - Chronotherapy of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs May Enhance Postoperative 
      Recovery.
LID - 468
AB  - Postoperative pain relief is crucial for full recovery. With the ongoing opioid
      epidemic and the insufficient effect of acetaminophen on severe pain;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are heavily used to alleviate this
      pain. However, NSAIDs are known to inhibit postoperative healing of connective
      tissues by inhibiting prostaglandin signaling. Pain intensity, inflammatory
      mediators associated with wound healing and the pharmacological action of NSAIDs 
      vary throughout the day due to the circadian rhythm regulated by the clock genes.
      According to this rhythm, most of wound healing mediators and connective tissue
      formation occurs during the resting phase, while pain, inflammation and tissue
      resorption occur during the active period of the day. Here we show, in a murine
      tibia fracture surgical model, that NSAIDs are most effective in managing
      postoperative pain, healing and recovery when drug administration is limited to
      the active phase of the circadian rhythm. Limiting NSAID treatment to the active 
      phase of the circadian rhythm resulted in overexpression of circadian clock
      genes, such as Period 2 (Per2) at the healing callus, and increased serum levels 
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-13 (IL-13), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and
      vascular endothelial growth factor. By contrast, NSAID administration during the 
      resting phase resulted in severe bone healing impairment.

TI  - The effectiveness of substance use interventions for homeless and vulnerably
      housed persons:  A systematic review of systematic reviews on supervised
      consumption facilities, managed alcohol programs, and pharmacological agents for 
      opioid use disorder.
LID - e0227298
AB  - Background: Substance use is disproportionately high among people who are
      homeless or vulnerably housed. We performed a systematic overview of reviews
      examining the effects of selected harm reduction and pharmacological
      interventions on the health and social well-being of people who use substances,
      with a focus on homeless populations. Methods and findings: We searched MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, PsycINFO, Joanna Briggs Institute EBP, Cochrane Database of Systematic
      Reviews and DARE for systematic reviews from inception to August 2019. We
      conducted a grey literature search and hand searched reference lists. We selected
      reviews that synthesized evidence on supervised consumption facilities, managed
      alcohol programs and pharmacological interventions for opioid use disorders. We
      abstracted data specific to homeless or vulnerably housed populations. We
      assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Our search identified
      483 citations and 30 systematic reviews met all inclusion criteria, capturing the
      results from 442 primary studies. This included three reviews on supervised
      consumption facilities, 24 on pharmacological interventions, and three on managed
      alcohol programs. Supervised consumption facilities decreased lethal overdoses
      and other high risk behaviours without any significant harm, and improved access 
      to care. Pharmaceutical interventions reduced mortality, morbidity, and substance
      use, but the impact on retention in treatment, mental illness and access to care 
      was variable. Managed alcohol programs reduced or stabilized alcohol consumption.
      Few studies on managed alcohol programs reported deaths. Conclusions: Substance
      use is a common chronic condition impacting homeless populations. Supervised
      consumption facilities reduce overdose and improve access to care, while
      pharmacological interventions may play a role in reducing harms and addressing
      other morbidity. High quality evidence on managed alcohol programs is limited.

TI  - Management of veterinary anaesthesia in small animals: A survey of current
      practice in Quebec.
LID - e0227204
AB  - Objective: To describe how small animal anaesthesia is performed in
      French-speaking Eastern Canada, and the variations between practices, in
      particular based on practice type, veterinarian gender and experience. Design:
      Observational study, survey. Sample: 156 respondents. Procedure: A questionnaire 
      was designed to assess current small animal anaesthesia practices in
      French-speaking Eastern Canada, mainly in the province of Quebec. The
      questionnaire was available through SurveyMonkey, and consisted of four parts:
      demographic information about the veterinarians surveyed, evaluation and
      management of anaesthetic risk, anaesthesia procedure, monitoring and safety.
      Gender, year of graduation, and type of practice were tested as potential risk
      factors. Chi-square exact test was used to study relations between each risk
      factor, and the effect of the selected risk factor on each response of the
      survey. For ordinal data, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to maximize
      power. Results: Response rate over a period of 3 months was 20.85% (156
      respondents). Overall, the way anaesthesia is performed by most respondents does 
      not meet international guidelines, such as patient preparation and evaluation
      prior to anaesthesia, not using individualised protocols (for 41%), not obtaining
      intravenous access (12.4% use it for all their anaesthesia in cats, and 30.6% in 
      dogs), lack of patient monitoring at certain intervals for 55% of the responses, 
      and client prompted optional analgesia (for 29% of respondents). Some practices
      are more compliant than others. Among them, referral centres generally offer
      better care than general practices. Conclusions and clinical relevance: The level
      of care in anaesthesia and analgesia in practices in French-speaking Eastern
      Canada is concerning, highlighting the need for more sustained continuing
      education.

TI  - Chronic Non-Malignant Pain in Patients with Cancer Seen at a Timely Outpatient
      Palliative Care Clinic.
LID - 214
AB  - Palliative care is seeing cancer patients earlier in the disease trajectory with 
      a multitude of chronic issues. Chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) in cancer
      patients is under-studied. In this prospective study, we examined the prevalence 
      and management of CNMP in cancer patients seen at our supportive care clinic for 
      consultation. We systematically characterized each pain type with the Brief Pain 
      Inventory (BPI) and documented current treatments. The attending physician made
      the pain diagnoses according to the International Association for the Study of
      Pain (IASP) task force classification. Among 200 patients (mean age 60 years, 69%
      metastatic disease, 1-year survival of 77%), the median number of pain diagnosis 
      was 2 (IQR 1–2); 67 (34%, 95% CI 28–41%) had a diagnosis of CNMP; 133 (67%) had
      cancer-related pain; and 52 (26%) had treatment-related pain. In total, 12/31
      (39%) patients with only CNMP and 21/36 (58%) patients with CNMP and other pain
      diagnoses were on opioids. There was a total of 94 CNMP diagnoses among 67
      patients, including 37 (39%) osteoarthritis and 20 (21%) lower back pain; 30
      (32%) were treated with opioids. In summary, CNMP was common in the timely
      palliative care setting and many patients were on opioids. Our findings highlight
      the need to develop clinical guidelines for CNMP in cancer patients to
      standardize its management.

TI  - Effects of Ovariohysterectomy and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy on Systemic
      Inflammation and Oxidation in Dogs.
LID - 506
AB  - Introduction: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves breathing 100% oxygen in 
      a specialized compression chamber leading to hyperoxia. This treatment modality
      is associated with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and healing properties in
      people and laboratory animals. However, there are relatively few reports that
      evaluate the effects of HBOT in companion animals. The goal of this study was to 
      investigate the physiological effects of HBOT on surgically induced systemic
      inflammation and oxidation in dogs.Material and Methods: Twelve healthy female
      beagle dogs were spayed and randomized into control and HBOT groups (n = 6). Both
      groups received conventional post-ovariohysterectomy therapy, and the HBOT group 
      received two hyperbaric treatments at 2.0 atmosphere of absolute pressure and
      100% oxygen for 35 min, 6 and 18 h after surgery. Blood samples were collected 3 
      h prior to ovariohysterectomy, 6, 18, and 30 h after surgery, prior to HBOT when 
      applicable. Inflammatory biomarkers, including C-reactive protein, circulating
      cytokines, and changes in iron homeostasis were evaluated at each time point to
      determine the effects of surgery and HBOT on inflammation. Similarly, serum total
      oxidant status and total antioxidant status were measured to assess the oxidative
      stress. Pain and incision scores were recorded and compared between
      groups.Results: Following ovariohysterectomy, all dogs had significantly
      increased serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, KC-like, IL-6, and
      increased unsaturated iron-binding capacity compared to their pre-surgical values
      (p < 0.02), while serum iron, total iron-binding capacity and transferrin
      saturation were significantly decreased after surgery (p < 0.02). There was no
      significant difference between the control group and the HBOT group for any of
      the variables. There were no overt adverse effects in the HBOT group.Conclusion: 
      This is the first prospective randomized controlled study to investigate the
      effects of HBOT on surgically induced systemic inflammation in dogs. While
      elective ovariohysterectomy resulted in mild inflammation, the described HBOT
      protocol portrayed no outward adverse effect and did not induce any detectable
      pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, or antioxidant effects. Additional
      investigation is required to identify objective markers to quantify the response 
      to HBOT and determine its role as an adjunctive therapy in dogs with more severe,
      complicated or chronic diseases.

TI  - Healthcare Resource Use and Cost: The Impact of Adopting an Abuse-Deterrent
      Formulation of Extended Release Morphine.
PG  - 35-44
AB  - Background: Development of abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs) of prescription
      opioids (RxO) is an important step toward reducing misuse and abuse.
      Morphine-ARER (MorphaBond™ ER) is an extended-release (ER) morphine sulfate
      tablet formulated to deter misuse/abuse via intravenous (IV) and intranasal (IN) 
      routes of administration. Objective: A model was developed to estimate the budget
      impact to a hypothetical commercial health plan of 10 million members 2 years
      after adding morphine-ARER to drug formulary. Methods: We analyzed incremental
      health care resource use (HCRU) associated with RxO misuse/abuse based on a
      health plan’s RxO formulary coverage and patterns of misuse/abuse. Misuse/abuse
      rates, incremental HCRU and associated costs were based on the 2015 National
      Survey on Drug Use and Health, an analysis of claims from OptumHealth Care
      Solutions, Inc. (2013–2015) and published literature. RxO formulary shares were
      based on 2016–2017 Symphony Retail Prescription data. Morphine-ARER was assumed
      to capture 20 and 30 percent from branded and 0.3 and 0.6 percent from generic
      non-ADF ER morphine, in the first and second years, respectively. Proportions of 
      misuse/abuse deterred by physical/chemical properties of morphine-ARER were
      assumed to be 90 percent via IV and 60 percent via IN administration, with
      further IN deterrence based on results from morphine-ARER’s human abuse liability
      study. Results: Adding morphine-ARER to formulary resulted in a potential
      decrease in abuse-related healthcare costs by $557,321 (−$0.00232 per-member
      per-month [PMPM]), offsetting a pharmacy cost increase of $217,045 (+$0.00090
      PMPM), resulting in net cost-savings of $0.00142 PMPM over 2 years, based on
      certain model assumptions. Conclusion: Placing morphine-ARER on a health plan’s
      drug formulary may result in reduced misuse/abuse and overall cost savings.

TI  - Case report: Successful induction of buprenorphine/naloxone using a microdosing
      schedule and assertive outreach.
LID - 2
AB  - Background: The requirement for moderate withdrawal prior to initiation can be a 
      barrier to buprenorphine/naloxone induction. Case presentation: We aimed to use a
      microdosing regimen to initiate regular dosing of buprenorphine/naloxone in a
      high-risk patient with a history of failed initiations due, in part, to
      withdrawal symptoms. Using an assertive outreach model and a
      buprenorphine/naloxone microdosing schedule, we initiated treatment of an
      individual’s opioid use disorder. There was a successful buprenorphine/naloxone
      microdosing induction as the team reached a therapeutic dose of
      buprenorphine/naloxone. Including the induction period, the medication was used
      consistently for 4 weeks. Conclusions: A microdosing schedule can be used to
      induce a patient onto buprenorphine/naloxone with no apparent withdrawal;
      gradually reducing illicit substance use. This case report builds on previous
      literature, highlighting ways to minimize barriers to induction of
      buprenorphine/naloxone, using a microdosing schedule and assertive outreach.
      Given the safety profile of buprenorphine and its potential to be a lifesaving
      intervention, a larger study of microdosing is indicated.

TI  - Association of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants use and
      falls in trauma patients: Conditional effect of age.
LID - e0227696
AB  - Introduction: The relationship between benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic
      antidepressants and trauma is of great importance because of increased
      consumption and the growing evidence of a positive association among older
      adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effect size of the
      association between the consumption of psychotropic medications /opioids and
      falls in patients who have suffered trauma by studying the role of other
      variables in this relationship. Method: From 2011 to 2016, the presence of
      benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and other drugs in 1060
      patients admitted for trauma at a level I trauma hospital was analysed.
      Multivariate models were used to measure the adjusted effect size of the
      association between consumption of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic
      antidepressants and falls, and the effect of age on this association was studied.
      Results: A total of 192 patients tested positive for benzodiazepines, opioids and
      tricyclic antidepressants, with same-level falls being the most frequent
      mechanism of injury in this group (40.1%), with an odds ratio of 1.96
      (1.40–2.75), p < 0.001. Once other covariates were introduced, this association
      was not observed, leaving only age, gender (woman) and, to a lesser extent,
      sensory conditions as variables associated with falls. Age acted as an effect
      modifier between benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic antidepressants and
      falls, with significant effect sizes starting at 51.9 years of age. Conclusions: 
      The association between the consumption of benzodiazepines, opioids and tricyclic
      antidepressants and falls in patients admitted for trauma is conditioned by other
      confounding variables, with age being the most influential confounding variable.

TI  - Estimating the impact of drug use on US mortality, 1999-2016.
LID - e0226732
AB  - The impact of rising drug use on US mortality may extend beyond deaths coded as
      drug-related to include excess mortality from other causes affected by drug use. 
      Here, we estimate the full extent of drug-associated mortality. We use annual
      death rates for 1999–2016 by state, sex, five-year age group, and cause of death 
      to model the relationship between drug-coded mortality—which serves as an
      indicator of the population-level prevalence of drug use—and mortality from other
      causes. Among residents aged 15–64 living in the 50 US states, the estimated
      number of drug-associated deaths in 2016 (141,695) was 2.2 times the number of
      drug-coded deaths (63,000). Adverse trends since 2010 in midlife mortality are
      largely attributable to drug-associated mortality. In the absence of drug use, we
      estimate that the probability of dying between ages 15 and 65 would have
      continued to decline after 2010 among men (to 15% in 2016) and would have
      remained at a low level (10%) among women. Our results suggest that an additional
      3.9% of men and 1.8% of women died between ages 15 and 65 in 2016 because of drug
      use. In terms of life expectancy beyond age 15, we estimate that drug use cost
      men 1.4 years and women 0.7 years, on average. In the hardest-hit state (West
      Virginia), drug use cost men 3.6 and women 1.9 life years. Recent declines in US 
      life expectancy have been blamed largely on the drug epidemic. Consistent with
      that inference, our results imply that, in the absence of drug use, life
      expectancy at age 15 would have increased slightly between 2014 and 2016.
      Drug-associated mortality in the US is roughly double that implied by drug-coded 
      deaths alone. The drug epidemic is exacting a heavy cost to American lives, not
      only from overdoses but from a variety of causes.

TI  - Hepatitis C Virus Prevalence in 50 U.S. States and D.C. by Sex, Birth Cohort, and
      Race: 2013‐2016.
PG  - 355-70
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver‐related morbidity
      and mortality, and more than 2 million adults in the United States are estimated 
      to be currently infected. Reducing HCV burden will require an understanding of
      demographic disparities and targeted efforts to reduce prevalence in populations 
      with disproportionate disease rates. We modeled state‐level estimates of
      hepatitis C prevalence among U.S. adults by sex, birth cohort, and race during
      2013‐2016. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data were used in
      combination with state‐level HCV‐related and narcotic overdose–related mortality 
      data from the National Vital Statistics System and estimates from external
      literature review on populations not sampled in the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey. Nationally, estimated hepatitis C prevalence was 1.3% among
      males and 0.6% among females (prevalence ratio [PR] = 2.3). Among persons born
      during 1945 to 1969, prevalence was 1.6% compared with 0.5% among persons born
      after 1969 (PR = 3.2). Among persons born during 1945 to 1969, prevalence ranged 
      from 0.7% in North Dakota to 3.6% in Oklahoma and 6.8% in the District of
      Columbia. Among persons born after 1969, prevalence was more than twice as high
      in Kentucky, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and West Virginia compared with the national
      average. Hepatitis C prevalence was 1.8% among non‐Hispanic black persons and
      0.8% among persons of other races (PR = 2.2), and the magnitude of this disparity
      varied widely across jurisdictions (PR range: 1.3‐7.8). Overall, 23% of prevalent
      HCV infections occurred among non‐Hispanic black persons, whereas 12% of the
      population was represented by this racial group. These estimates provide
      information on prevalent HCV infections that jurisdictions can use for
      understanding and monitoring local disease patterns and racial disparities in
      burden of disease.

TI  - Dopamine D3 Receptor Antagonism Reverses the Escalation of Oxycodone
      Self-administration and Decreases Withdrawal-Induced Hyperalgesia and
      Irritability-Like Behavior in Oxycodone-Dependent Heterogeneous Stock Rats.
LID - 292
AB  - Prescription opioids, such as oxycodone, are highly effective analgesics for
      clinical pain management, but approximately 25% of patients who are prescribed
      opioids misuse them, and 5%–10% develop an opioid use disorder (OUD). Effective
      therapies for the prevention and treatment of opioid abuse and addiction need to 
      be developed. The present study evaluated the effects of the highly selective
      dopamine D3 receptor antagonist VK4-116
      ([R]-N-[4-(4-[3-chloro-5-ethyl-2-methoxyphenyl]piperazin-1-yl)-3-hydroxybutyl]-1H
      -indole-2-carboxamide) on oxycodone addictive-like behaviors. We used a model of 
      extended access to oxycodone self-administration and tested the effects of
      VK4-116 on the escalation of oxycodone self-administration and withdrawal-induced
      hyperalgesia and irritability-like behavior in male and female rats. Pretreatment
      with VK4-116 (5–25 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently decreased the escalation of
      oxycodone self-administration and reduced withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia and
      irritability-like behavior in opioid-dependent rats. These findings demonstrate a
      key role for D3 receptors in both the motivation to take opioids and negative
      emotional states that are associated with opioid withdrawal and suggest that D3
      receptor antagonism may be a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of
      OUD.

TI  - Palliative care for patients with substance use disorder and multiple problems: a
      qualitative study on experiences of healthcare professionals, volunteers and
      experts-by-experience.
LID - 8
AB  - Background: There is little information about how healthcare professionals feel
      about providing palliative care for patients with a substance use disorder (SUD).
      Therefore, this study aims to explore: 1) the problems and needs experienced by
      healthcare professionals, volunteers and experts-by-experience (HCP/VE) during
      their work with patients with SUD in a palliative care trajectory and; 2) to make
      suggestions for improvements using the quality of care model by Donabedian
      (Structure, Process, Outcome). Methods: A qualitative study was conducted,
      consisting of six focus group interviews which consisted of HCP/VE working with
      patients with SUD in a palliative care phase. At the end of the focus group
      interviews, participants structured and summarized their experiences within a
      Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) framework. Interview
      transcripts (other than the SWOT) were analysed by the researchers following
      procedures from the Grounded Theory Approach (‘Grounded Theory Lite’).
      SWOT-findings were not subjected to in-depth analysis. Results: HCP/VE stated
      that within the Structure of care, care networks are fragmented and HCP/VE often 
      lack knowledge about patients’ multiplicity of problems and the time to unravel
      these. Communication with this patient group appears limited. The actual
      care-giving Process requires HCP/VE a lot of creativity and time spent seeking
      for cooperation with other caregivers and appropriate care settings. The latter
      is often hindered by stigma. Since no formalized knowledge is available,
      care-delivery is often exclusively experience-based. Pain-medication is often
      ineffective due to active substance use. Finally, several Outcomes were brought
      forward: Firstly, a palliative care phase is often identified only at a late
      stage. Secondly, education and a (mobile) team of expertise are desired. Thirdly,
      care for the caregivers themselves is often de-prioritized. Conclusions: Better
      integration and collaboration between the different professionals with extensive 
      experience in addiction, palliative and general curative care is imperative to
      assure good palliative care for patients with SUD. Currently, the resources for
      this care appear to be insufficient. Development of an educational program and
      social mapping may be the first steps in improving palliative care for patients
      with severe SUD.

      retrospective cohort study.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Pain is a common and burdensome complication in patients with acute
      stroke. We assessed the impact of impaired communication in stroke patients on
      pain assessment and treatment. Methods: We included 909 (507 male, mean age
      71.8 years) patients admitted to our stroke unit from 01/2015 to 12/2015 in the
      analysis. Patients were assigned to four groups: able to communicate (AC), not
      able to communicate prior to index stroke (P-NAC), due to focal symptoms of index
      stroke (S-NAC), due to a reduced level of consciousness (C-NAC). Pain prevalence,
      documentation of pain and use of analgesics were evaluated. C-NAC patients were
      excluded from analyses regarding analgesic treatment due to relevant differences 
      in patient characteristics. Results: 746 patients (82.1%) were classified as AC, 
      25 (2.8%) as P-NAC, 90 (9.9%) as S-NAC and 48 (5.3%) as C-NAC. Pain was
      documented on the Numeric Rating Scale and in form of free text by nurses and
      physicians. Nurses documented pain more frequently than physicians (p < 0.001).
      Pain prevalence was 47.0% (n.s. between groups). The use of analgesic medication 
      increased from 48.7% in the AC group, to 76.0% in the P-NAC group, and 77.8% in
      the S-NAC group (p < 0.001). Opioid use was significantly more frequent in NAC
      patients (p < 0.001). The response to the treatment was poorly documented with
      significantly lowest rates in S-NAC patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study 
      suggests that post-stroke pain in patients with inability to communicate is not
      attended enough, not systematically assessed and therefore not sufficiently
      treated.

TI  - The Value Proposition for Pathologists: A Population Health Approach.
LID - 2374289519898857
AB  - The transition to a value-based payment system offers pathologists the
      opportunity to play an increased role in population health by improving outcomes 
      and safety as well as reducing costs. Although laboratory testing itself accounts
      for a small portion of health-care spending, laboratory data have significant
      downstream effects in patient management as well as diagnosis. Pathologists
      currently are heavily engaged in precision medicine, use of laboratory and
      pathology test results (including autopsy data) to reduce diagnostic errors, and 
      play leading roles in diagnostic management teams. Additionally, pathologists can
      use aggregate laboratory data to monitor the health of populations and improve
      health-care outcomes for both individual patients and populations. For the
      profession to thrive, pathologists will need to focus on extending their roles
      outside the laboratory beyond the traditional role in the analytic phase of
      testing. This should include leadership in ensuring correct ordering and
      interpretation of laboratory testing and leadership in population health
      programs. Pathologists in training will need to learn key concepts in informatics
      and data analytics, health-care economics, public health, implementation science,
      and health systems science. While these changes may reduce reimbursement for the 
      traditional activities of pathologists, new opportunities arise for value
      creation and new compensation models. This report reviews these opportunities for
      pathologist leadership in utilization management, precision medicine, reducing
      diagnostic errors, and improving health-care outcomes.

TI  - COPD and asthma in patients with opioid dependency: a cross-sectional study in
      primary care.
LID - 4
AB  - Patients treated for drug addiction have high asthma and COPD prevalence rates.
      The relative contributions of cigarette smoking, smoking intensity and possible
      smoking of other substances has not been described. We aimed to describe the
      prevalence and determinants of asthma and COPD in patients prescribed methadone
      as opioid substitution therapy (OST). In a cross-sectional study of an anonymised
      patient-level primary care dataset of UK inner-city general practices (n = 46),
      321,395 patients aged ≥18 years were identified. A total of 676 (0.21%) had a
      record of a methadone ever issued in primary care. The association between
      respiratory disease and methadone prescribing was examined using logistic
      regression. Models were adjusted for potential effects of clustering by practice.
      A total of 97.3% of patients prescribed methadone were cigarette smokers, either 
      current (81.2%) or ex-smokers (16.1%). The prevalences of asthma and COPD were
      higher in methadone patients (14.2% and 12.4%, respectively) compared to
      non-methadone patients (4.4% and 1.1%, respectively). Methadone was an
      independent determinant of asthma, adjusting for smoking status (OR 3.21; 95% CI:
      2.52, 4.10) or for smoking intensity (3.08; 2.27, 4.19), and of COPD, adjusting
      for smoking status (6.00; 4.61, 7.80) or for smoking intensity (5.80; 4.12,
      8.17). COPD and asthma prevalence were substantially higher in those prescribed
      methadone compared to those never prescribed methadone. Prescription of methadone
      was an independent predictor for both COPD and asthma, even after adjustment for 
      smoking status and smoking intensity. Possible explanations include confounding
      by association with smoking of heroin or crack cocaine, both of which may have a 
      causal association with COPD and asthma.

TI  - A rapid access to addiction medicine clinic facilitates treatment of substance
      use disorder and reduces substance use.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: Substance use is prevalent in Canada, yet treatment is inaccessible. 
      The Rapid Access to Addiction Medicine (RAAM) clinic opened at the University
      Health Network (UHN) in January 2018 as part of a larger network of addictions
      clinics in Toronto, Ontario, to enable timely, low barrier access to medical
      treatment for substance use disorder (SUD). Patients attend on a walk-in basis
      without requiring an appointment or referral. We describe the RAAM clinic model, 
      including referral patterns, patient demographics and substance use patterns.
      Secondary outcomes include retention in treatment and changes in both
      self-reported and objective substance use. Methods: The Electronic Medical Record
      at the clinic was reviewed for the first 26 weeks of the clinic’s operation. We
      identified SUD diagnoses, referral source, medications prescribed, retention in
      care and self-reported substance use. Results: The clinic saw 64 unique patients:
      66% had alcohol use disorder (AUD), 39% had opiate use disorder (OUD) and 20% had
      stimulant use disorder. Fifty-five percent of patients were referred from primary
      care providers, 30% from the emergency department and 11% from withdrawal
      management services. Forty-two percent remained on-going patients, 23% were
      discharged to other care and 34% were lost to follow-up. Gabapentin (39%),
      naltrexone (39%), and acamprosate (15%) were most frequently prescribed for AUD. 
      Patients with AUD reported a significant decrease in alcohol consumption at their
      most recent visit. Most patients (65%) with OUD were prescribed buprenorphine,
      and most patients with OUD (65%) had a negative urine screen at their most recent
      visit. Conclusion: The RAAM model provides low-barrier, accessible outpatient
      care for patients with substance use disorder and facilitates the prescription of
      evidence-based pharmacotherapy for AUD and OUD. Patients referred by their
      primary care physician and the emergency department demonstrated a reduction in
      median alcohol consumption and high rates of opioid abstinence.

TI  - Factors predicting one-year post-surgical mortality amongst older Asian patients 
      undergoing moderate to major non-cardiac surgery – a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 11
AB  - Background: While short-term perioperative outcomes have been well studied in
      Western surgical populations, the aim of this study is to look at the one-year
      perioperative mortality and its associated factors in an Asian surgical
      population after non-cardiac surgery. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of
      2163 patients aged above 45 undergoing non-cardiac surgery in a
      university-affiliated tertiary hospital from January to July 2015 was performed. 
      Relevant demographic, clinical and surgical data were analysed to elicit their
      relationship to mortality at one year after surgery. A univariate analysis was
      first performed to identify significant variables with p-values ≤ 0.2, which were
      then analysed using Firth multiple logistic regression to calculate the adjusted 
      odds ratio. Results: The one-year mortality in our surgical population was 5.9%. 
      The significant factors that increased one-year mortality include smoking
      (adjusted OR 2.17 (1.02–4.45), p = 0.044), anaemia (adjusted OR 1.32 (1.16–1.47),
      p < 0.001, for every 1 g/dL drop in haemoglobin level), lower BMI (adjusted OR
      0.93 (0.87–0.98), p = 0.005, for every 1 point increase in BMI), Malay and Indian
      ethnicity (adjusted OR 2.68 (1.53–4.65), p = 0.001), peripheral vascular disease 
      (adjusted OR 4.21 (1.62–10.38), p = 0.004), advanced age (adjusted OR 1.04
      (1.01–1.06), p = 0.004, for every one year increase in age), emergency surgery
      (adjusted OR 2.26 (1.29–3.15), p = 0.005) and malignancy (adjusted OR 3.20
      (1.85–5.52), p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study shows that modifiable risk
      factors such as malnutrition, anaemia and smoking which affect short term
      mortality extend beyond the immediate perioperative period into longer term
      outcomes. Identification and optimization of this subset of patients are
      therefore vital. Further similar large studies should be done to develop a risk
      scoring system for post-operative long-term outcomes. This would aid clinicians
      in risk stratification, counselling and surgical planning, which will help in
      patients’ decision making and care planning.

TI  - The nephrologist's guide to cannabis and cannabinoids.
PG  - 248-57
AB  - Purpose of review: Cannabis (marijuana, weed, pot, ganja, Mary Jane) is the most 
      commonly used federally illicit drug in the United States. The present review
      provides an overview of cannabis and cannabinoids with relevance to the practice 
      of nephrology so that clinicians can best take care of patients. Recent findings:
      Cannabis may have medicinal benefits for treating symptoms of advanced chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease including as a pain adjuvant
      potentially reducing the need for opioids. Cannabis does not seem to affect
      kidney function in healthy individuals. However, renal function should be closely
      monitored in those with CKD, the lowest effective dose should be used, and
      smoking should be avoided. Cannabis use may delay transplant candidate listing or
      contribute to ineligibility. Cannabidiol (CBD) has recently exploded in
      popularity. Although generally well tolerated, safe without significant side
      effects, and effective for a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, 
      consumers have easy access to a wide range of unregulated CBD products, some with
      inaccurate labeling and false health claims. Importantly, CBD may raise
      tacrolimus levels. Summary: Patients and healthcare professionals have little
      guidance or evidence regarding the impact of cannabis use on people with kidney
      disease. This knowledge gap will remain as long as federal regulations remain
      prohibitively restrictive towards prospective research.

AB  - Sepsis, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, is caused by a deregulated
      host response to pathogens, and subsequent life-threatening organ dysfunctions.
      All major systems, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic,
      hematological, and the neurological system may be affected by sepsis. Sepsis
      associated neurological dysfunction is triggered by multiple factors including
      neuro-inflammation, excitotoxicity, and ischemia. Ischemia results from reduced
      cerebral blood flow, caused by extreme variations of blood pressure, occlusion of
      cerebral vessels, or more subtle defects of the microcirculation. International
      guidelines comprehensively describe the initial hemodynamic management of sepsis,
      revolving around the normalization of systemic hemodynamics and of arterial
      lactate. By contrast, the management of sepsis patients suffering from brain
      dysfunction is poorly detailed, the only salient point being mentioned is that
      sedation and analgesia should be optimized. However, sepsis and the hemodynamic
      consequences thereof as well as vasopressors may have severe untoward
      neurological consequences. The current review describes the general neurological 
      complications, as well as the consequences of vasopressor therapy on the brain
      and its circulation and addresses methods for cerebral monitoring during sepsis.

TI  - Behavioral and Neuroanatomical Account of Impulsivity in Parkinson's Disease.
LID - 1338
AB  - Impulse control disorder (ICD) is a major non-motor complication of Parkinson's
      disease (PD) with often devastating consequences for patients' quality of life.
      In this study, we aimed to characterize the phenotype of impulsivity in PD and
      its neuroanatomical correlates.Methods: Thirty-seven PD patients (15 patients
      with ICD, 22 patients without ICD) and 36 healthy controls underwent a
      neuropsychological battery. The test battery consisted of anxiety and depression 
      scales, self-report measures of impulsivity (Barratt scale and UPPS-P),
      behavioral measures of impulsive action (Go/No-Go task, Stop signal task) and
      impulsive choice (Delay discounting, Iowa gambling task), and measures of
      cognitive abilities (working memory, attention, executive function). Patients and
      controls underwent structural MRI scanning.Results: Patients with ICD had
      significantly higher levels of self-reported impulsivity (Barratt scale and Lack 
      of perseverance from UPPS-P) in comparison with healthy controls and
      non-impulsive PD patients, but they performed similarly in behavioral tasks,
      except for the Iowa gambling task. In this task, patients with ICD made
      significantly less risky decisions than patients without ICD and healthy
      controls. Patients without ICD did not differ from healthy controls in
      self-reported impulsivity or behavioral measurements. Both patient groups were
      more anxious and depressive than healthy controls. MRI scanning revealed
      structural differences in cortical areas related to impulse control in both
      patient groups. Patients without ICD had lower volumes and cortical thickness of 
      bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Patients with ICD had higher volumes of right
      caudal anterior cingulate and rostral middle frontal cortex.Conclusions: Despite 
      the presence of ICD as confirmed by both clinical follow-up and self-reported
      impulsivity scales and supported by structural differences in various neural
      nodes related to inhibitory control and reward processing, patients with ICD
      performed no worse than healthy controls in various behavioral tasks previously
      hypothesized as robust impulsivity measures. These results call for caution
      against impetuous interpretation of behavioral tests, since various factors may
      and will influence the ultimate outcomes, be it the lack of sensitivity in
      specific, limited ICD subtypes, excessive caution of ICD patients during testing 
      due to previous negative experience rendering simplistic tasks insufficient, or
      other, as of now unknown aspects, calling for further research.

TI  - Stimulant safe supply: a potential opportunity to respond to the overdose
      epidemic.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: Occurring against the backdrop of an overdose crisis, stimulant use
      and stimulant-involved deaths in North America are increasing at an alarming
      rate. Many of these deaths are being attributed to fentanyl and related analogs, 
      which have been increasingly found within street-level stimulant supplies. Within
      this, people experiencing socio-economic marginalization are at the greatest risk
      of overdose and other harms from adulterated stimulants. Current treatments for
      stimulant use disorder have limited effectiveness, and even less applicability to
      the lived realities of marginalized stimulant users. Emerging technologies, such 
      as drug checking, are being implemented to support safer stimulant use, but the
      accessibility and utility of these technologies to stimulant users are framed by 
      experiences of vulnerability that render them largely ineffective. Stimulant safe
      supply: Solutions that provide a legal and safe supply of non-adulterated
      stimulants of known quality, and within a health care framework, are needed to
      directly address the risk of an increasingly adulterated stimulant supply.
      Similar innovative opioid-focused interventions are being piloted with
      medications that have a similar pharmacological effect as their illicit
      counterparts. While there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for
      stimulant use, research has demonstrated a number of stimulant medications that
      are promising substitutes for cocaine and methamphetamine use. Much like with
      opioid-focused pharmacotherapies, having a consistent and safe supply of
      stimulants can lead to improved health outcomes and will drastically reduce
      overdose risk. However, for a stimulant safe supply intervention to be a success,
      it must provide the high and performance-enhancing effects that people seek from 
      the illicit market, which requires doses and user agency that trials to date have
      not provided. Conclusion: Efforts are needed to investigate the feasibility of
      pharmacological stimulant-based interventions that address safe supply needs. The
      promise of similar opioid-focused approaches in addressing both overdose-related 
      risks and experiences related to vulnerability underscores the need to advance
      safe supply approaches targeted towards people who use stimulants. Given the
      current overdose crisis and rising stimulant use across North America, the
      implementation and evaluation of such novel stimulant-focused interventions
      should be a public health priority.

TI  - Health care professionals’ knowledge of commonly used sedative, analgesic and
      neuromuscular drugs: A single center (Rambam Health Care Campus), prospective,
      observational survey.
LID - e0227499
AB  - Background: Pain management and sedation are important aspects in the treatment
      of hospitalized patients, especially those mechanically ventilated. In many
      hospitals, such patients are treated not only in intensive care units, but also
      in other wards. In the nineteen eighties, numerous studies demonstrated a wide
      array of misconceptions and inadequate knowledge related to commonly used
      sedative, analgesics and muscle relaxants which may prevent appropriate
      treatment. Since these publications, multiple studies have shown that appropriate
      sedation and analgesia are associated with improved clinical outcomes,
      educational programs were developed and guidelines published. Whether the
      personnel’s knowledge kept up with these changes is unknown. The aim of this
      study was to determine the current rate of misconceptions and knowledge gaps
      regarding commonly used sedative, analgesic and neuromuscular drugs. Methods: In 
      this prospective, observational, cross-sectional survey, a questionnaire was
      e-mailed to physicians and nurses routinely treating mechanically ventilated
      patients in Rambam Health Care Campus (Haifa, Israel). Results: 355
      questionnaires were returned. 82.54% knew that midazolam has no analgesic effect.
      71–72% were familiar with the sedative effect of opiates. 27% believed that
      propofol has analgesic properties and 30.52% thought that rocuronium has a
      sedative effect. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that although a lot has
      been done during the last decades in order to improve the treatment of critically
      ill patients, the rate of misconceptions regarding pharmacological
      characteristics of commonly used drugs is unacceptably high. We call for
      performance of similar surveys in other institutes and for immediate action to
      improve patients’ care.

TI  - Association between opioid analgesic therapy and initiation of buprenorphine
      management: An analysis of prescription drug monitoring program data.
LID - e0227350
AB  - Background: In the US, medication assisted treatment, particularly with
      office-based buprenorphine, has been an important component of opioid dependence 
      treatment among patients with iatrogenic addiction to opioid analgesics. The
      predictors of initiating buprenorphine for addiction among opioid analgesic
      patients have not been well-described. Methods: We conducted a time-to-event
      analysis using data from the North Carolina (NC) Prescription Drug Monitoring
      Program (PDMP). Our outcome of interest was time-to-initiation of sublingual
      buprenorphine. Our study population was a prospective cohort of all state
      residents receiving a full-agonist opioid analgesic between 2011 and 2015.
      Predictors of initiation of sublingual buprenorphine examined included: age,
      gender, cumulative pharmacies and prescribers utilized, cumulative opioid
      intensity (defined as cumulative opioid exposure divided by duration of opioid
      exposure), and benzodiazepine dispensing. Findings: Of 4.3 million patients
      receiving opioid analgesics in NC between 2011 and 2015 (accumulated 8.30 million
      person-years of follow-up), and a total of 28,904 patients initiated
      buprenorphine formulations intended for addiction treatment (overall rate 3.48
      per 1,000 person-years). In adjusted multivariate models, the utilization of 3 or
      more pharmacies (HR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.82, 3.05) or 6 or more controlled substance 
      prescribers (HR: 12.09; 95% CI: 10.76, 13.57) was associated with buprenorphine
      initiation. A dose-response relationship was observed for cumulative opioid
      intensity (HR in highest decile relative to lowest decile: 5.05; 95% CI: 4.70,
      5.42). Benzodiazepine dispensing was negatively associated with buprenorphine
      initiation (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.65). Conclusions: Opioid analgesic patients
      utilizing multiple prescribers or pharmacies are more likely to initiate
      sublingual buprenorphine. This finding suggests that patients with multiple
      healthcare interactions are more likely to be treated for high-risk opioid use,
      or may be more likely to be identified and treated for addiction. Future research
      should utilize prescription monitoring program data linked to electronic health
      records to include diagnosis information in analytic models.

TI  - ABC efflux transporters at blood-central nervous system barriers and their
      implications for treating spinal cord disorders.
PG  - 1235-42
AB  - The barriers present in the interfaces between the blood and the central nervous 
      system form a major hurdle for the pharmacological treatment of central nervous
      system injuries and diseases. The family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporters has been widely studied regarding efflux of medications at
      blood-central nervous system barriers. These efflux transporters include
      P-glycoprotein (abcb1), ‘breast cancer resistance protein’ (abcg2) and the
      various ‘multidrug resistance-associated proteins’ (abccs). Understanding which
      efflux transporters are present at the blood-spinal cord, blood-cerebrospinal
      fluid and cerebrospinal fluid-spinal cord barriers is necessary to determine
      their involvement in limiting drug transfer from blood to the spinal cord tissue.
      Recent developments in the blood-brain barrier field have shown that barrier
      systems are dynamic and the profile of barrier defenses can alter due to
      conditions such as age, disease and environmental challenge. This means that a
      true understanding of ABC efflux transporter expression and localization should
      not be one static value but instead a range that represents the complex patient
      subpopulations that exist. In the present review, the blood-central nervous
      system barrier literature is discussed with a focus on the impact of ABC efflux
      transporters on: (i) protecting the spinal cord from adverse effects of
      systemically directed drugs, and (ii) limiting centrally directed drugs from
      accessing their active sites within the spinal cord.

TI  - Challenges and Opportunities in Preclinical Research of Synthetic Cannabinoids
      for Pain Therapy.
LID - 24
AB  - Cannabis has been used in pain management since 2900 BC. In the 20th century,
      synthetic cannabinoids began to emerge, thus opening the way for improved
      efficacy. The search for new forms of synthetic cannabinoids continues and, as
      such, the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive tool for the research 
      and development of this promising class of drugs. Methods for the in vitro
      assessment of cytotoxic, mutagenic or developmental effects are presented,
      followed by the main in vivo pain models used in cannabis research and the
      results yielded by different types of administration (systemic versus intrathecal
      versus inhalation). Animal models designed for assessing side-effects and
      long-term uses are also discussed. In the second part of this review,
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of synthetic cannabinoid
      biodistribution, together with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometric
      identification of synthetic cannabinoids in biological fluids from rodents to
      humans are presented. Last, but not least, different strategies for improving the
      solubility and physicochemical stability of synthetic cannabinoids and their
      potential impact on pain management are discussed. In conclusion, synthetic
      cannabinoids are one of the most promising classes of drugs in pain medicine, and
      preclinical research should focus on identifying new and improved alternatives
      for a better clinical and preclinical outcome.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Opioid Cessation.
LID - 180
AB  - The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) and
      overdose-related deaths. However, the genetic basis for the ability to
      discontinue opioid use has not been investigated. We performed a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) of opioid cessation (defined as abstinence from illicit 
      opioids for >1 year or <6 months before the interview date) in 1130 African
      American (AA) and 2919 European ancestry (EA) participants recruited for genetic 
      studies of substance use disorders and who met lifetime Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for OUD.
      Association tests performed separately within each ethnic group were combined by 
      meta-analysis with results obtained from the Comorbidity and Trauma Study.
      Although there were no genome-wide significant associations, we found suggestive 
      associations with nine independent loci, including three which are biologically
      relevant: rs4740988 in PTPRD (pAA + EA = 2.24 × 10−6), rs36098404 in MYOM2 (pEA =
      2.24 × 10−6), and rs592026 in SNAP25-AS1 (pEA = 6.53 × 10−6). Significant
      pathways identified in persons of European ancestry (EA) are related to vitamin D
      metabolism (p = 3.79 × 10−2) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (p =
      2.39 × 10−2). UK Biobank traits including smoking and drinking cessation and
      chronic back pain were significantly associated with opioid cessation using
      GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores. These results provide evidence for genetic
      influences on opioid cessation, suggest genetic overlap with other relevant
      traits, and may indicate potential novel therapeutic targets for OUD.

TI  - Physical Activity in Eating Disorders: A Systematic Review.
LID - 183
AB  - Abnormally high levels of physical activity have been documented throughout the
      literature in patients with eating disorders (ED), especially those diagnosed
      with anorexia nervosa (AN). Yet no clear definition, conceptualization, or
      treatment of the problematic use of physical activity (PPA) in ED patients
      exists. The aim of this review is to propose a new classification of PPA, report 
      the prevalence, triggers, predictors, maintainers and other related factors of
      PPA in ED patients, in addition to proposing a comprehensive model of the
      development of PPA in AN. A total of 47 articles, retrieved from Medline and Web 
      of Science, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. As a
      result, the new approach of PPA was divided into two groups (group 1 and group 2)
      according to the dimension (quantitative vs qualitative approach) of physical
      activity that was evaluated. The prevalence of PPA in ED was reported in 20 out
      of 47 studies, the comparison of PPA between ED versus controls in 21 articles,
      and the links between PPA and psychological factors in ED in 26 articles,
      including depression (16/26), anxiety (13/26), obsessive–compulsiveness (9/26),
      self-esteem (4/26), addictiveness (1/26), regulation and verbal expression of
      emotions (1/26) and anhedonia (1/26). The links between PPA and ED
      symptomatology, PPA and weight, body mass index (BMI) and body composition in ED,
      PPA and age, onset, illness duration and lifetime activity status in ED, PPA and 
      ED treatment outcome were reported in 18, 15, 7, 5 articles, respectively. All of
      the factors have been systematically clustered into group 1 and group 2. Results 
      focused more on AN rather than BN due to the limited studies on the latter.
      Additionally, a model for the development of PPA in AN patients was proposed,
      encompassing five periods evolving into three clinical stages. Thus, two very
      opposite components of PPA in AN were suggested: voluntarily PPA increased in AN 
      was viewed as a conscious strategy to maximize weight loss, while involuntarily
      PPA increased proportionally with weight-loss, indicating that exercise might be 
      under the control of a subconscious biological drive and involuntary cognition.

TI  - Women’s Perspectives On Provider Education Regarding Opioid Use.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - Objective: To elucidate women’s experiences with opioid medications and their
      perspectives on provider education regarding opioid use, risks and safety.
      Methods: Women with a self-reported history of pain who had been prescribed
      opioids were recruited in 2016 using a convenience sampling approach that
      included an online social media campaign. Participants (N=154) completed online
      surveys and open-ended questions regarding their experiences with pain and
      opioids, and their perspectives on the quality of education they received from
      their providers. Results: Participants reported receiving insufficient education 
      about opioid-related side effects, as reflected in both ratings for the quantity 
      and quality of education they received from their providers. Non-white
      participants reported lower quantity and poorer quality of provider education
      (p<0.05). Themes identified from the qualitative data included frustrations with 
      pain management options, fear of opioids, stigma associated with opioid use, and 
      the need for improved provider education and patient-provider communication.
      Conclusion: Findings suggest that from a patient’s perspective, there is a need
      for enhanced patient-provider communication and education regarding pain
      management and potential opioid-related side effects. Improved physician
      communication and education could promote shared decision-making and result in
      enhanced satisfaction with care and health outcomes.

TI  - Bowel movement frequency and risks of major vascular and non-vascular diseases: a
      population-based cohort study among Chinese adults.
LID - e031028
AB  - Objective: The application of bowel movement frequency (BMF) in primary care is
      limited by the lack of solid evidence about the associations of BMF with health
      outcomes apart from Parkinson’s disease and colorectal cancer. We examined the
      prospective associations of BMF with major vascular and non-vascular diseases
      outside the digestive system. Design: Population-based prospective cohort study. 
      Setting: The China Kadoorie Biobank in which participants from 10 geographically 
      diverse areas across China were enrolled between 2004 and 2008. Participants: 487
      198 participants aged 30 to 79 years without cancer, heart disease or stroke at
      baseline were included and followed up for a median of 10 years. The usual BMF
      was self-reported once at baseline. Primary and secondary outcome measures:
      Incident events of predefined major vascular and non-vascular diseases. Results: 
      In multivariable-adjusted analyses, participants having bowel movements ‘more
      than once a day’ had higher risks of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), heart
      failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) when compared with the reference group (‘once a
      day’). The respective HRs (95% CIs) were 1.12 (1.09 to 1.16), 1.33 (1.22 to
      1.46), 1.28 (1.22 to 1.36), 1.20 (1.15 to 1.26) and 1.15 (1.07 to 1.24). The
      lowest BMF (‘less than three times a week’) was also associated with higher risks
      of IHD, major coronary events, ischaemic stroke and CKD. The respective HRs were 
      1.07 (1.02 to 1.12), 1.22 (1.10 to 1.36), 1.11 (1.05 to 1.16) and 1.20 (1.07 to
      1.35). Conclusion: BMF was associated with future risks of multiple vascular and 
      non-vascular diseases. The integration of BMF assessment and health counselling
      into primary care should be considered.

TI  - Are the MORECare guidelines on reporting of attrition in palliative care research
      populations appropriate? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised
      controlled trials.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: Palliative care trials have higher rates of attrition. The MORECare
      guidance recommends applying classifications of attrition to report attrition to 
      help interpret trial results. The guidance separates attrition into three
      categories: attrition due to death, illness or at random. The aim of our study is
      to apply the MORECare classifications on reported attrition rates in trials.
      Methods: A systematic review was conducted and attrition classifications
      retrospectively applied. Four databases, EMBASE; Medline, CINHAL and PsychINFO,
      were searched for randomised controlled trials of palliative care populations
      from 01.01.2010 to 08.10.2016. This systematic review is part of a larger review 
      looking at recruitment to randomised controlled trials in palliative care, from
      January 1990 to early October 2016. We ran random-effect models with and without 
      moderators and descriptive statistics to calculate rates of missing data.
      Results: One hundred nineteen trials showed a total attrition of 29% (95% CI 28
      to 30%). We applied the MORECare classifications of attrition to the 91 papers
      that contained sufficient information. The main reason for attrition was
      attrition due to death with a weighted mean of 31.6% (SD 27.4) of attrition
      cases. Attrition due to illness was cited as the reason for 17.6% (SD 24.5) of
      participants. In 50.8% (SD 26.5) of cases, the attrition was at random. We did
      not observe significant differences in missing data between total attrition in
      non-cancer patients (26%; 95% CI 18–34%) and cancer patients (24%; 95% CI
      20–29%). There was significantly more missing data in outpatients (29%; 95% CI
      22–36%) than inpatients (16%; 95% CI 10–23%). We noted increased attrition in
      trials with longer durations. Conclusion: Reporting the cause of attrition is
      useful in helping to understand trial results. Prospective reporting using the
      MORECare classifications should improve our understanding of future trials.

TI  - Preventing opioid overdose with peer-administered naloxone: findings from a rural
      state.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: In response to the opioid epidemic, naloxone distribution programs
      aim to prevent overdose death by making naloxone available and training people to
      use it. Peers of individuals at risk of opioid overdose are well-positioned to
      administer naloxone and prevent overdose death. Methods: We conducted key
      informant interviews with 18 individuals with past or current opioid and heroin
      drug use who had administered naloxone to a peer during an overdose emergency.
      Interviews explored individuals’ experiences with administration and their
      recommendations for program and policy improvement. Data were systematically
      coded and analyzed for themes. Results: Participants sought naloxone rescue kits 
      because they perceived high risk of overdose. They described high satisfaction
      with training and felt prepared to administer naloxone during overdose incidents.
      Overwhelmingly, participants perceived naloxone to be effective and emphasized
      the need to make it widely available. Findings suggest that engagement in
      overdose prevention strategies other than naloxone differs by gender, with
      females more likely than males to use multiple different strategies. Participants
      described that overdose experiences do not have a lasting impact on drug use
      behaviors. Conclusions: Findings support the feasibility of naloxone distribution
      to peer opioid and heroin users and provide recommendations for policy
      improvement, including effective and well-advertised Good Samaritan laws and
      links to treatment for opioid use disorder.

TI  - Investigating opioid-related fatalities in southern Sweden: contact with
      care-providing authorities and comparison of substances.
LID - 5
AB  - Background: Opioid-related deaths have increased in Western countries over recent
      decades. Despite numerous studies investigating opioid-related mortality, only a 
      few have focused on the lives of the deceased individuals prior to their deaths, 
      specifically regarding contact with care-providing authorities such as health,
      social and correctional services. Furthermore, a change has been noted in the
      last two decades as to which opioids cause most deaths, from heroin to
      prescription opioids. However, studies comparing fatalities caused by different
      substances are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate contact with
      care-providing authorities during the year prior to death among individuals who
      died as a result of opioid intoxication and to analyse differences relating to
      which opioids caused their deaths. Methods: The study is based on retrospective
      register data and includes 180 individuals with a history of illicit drug use,
      who died from opioid intoxication in Skåne, Sweden, between 1 January 2012 to 31 
      December 2013 and 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016. Intoxications caused by heroin,
      methadone, buprenorphine and fentanyl were included. Data were collected from the
      National Board of Forensic Medicine, regional health care services, municipal
      social services and the Prison and Probation Service. Statistical testing was
      performed using Pearson’s chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test and the
      Mann-Whitney U test to analyse group differences. Results: A total of 89% of the 
      deceased individuals had been in contact with one or more of the care-providing
      authorities during the year prior to death; 75% had been in contact with health
      care, 69% with the social services, 28% with the Prison and Probation Service,
      and 23% had been enrolled in opioid substitution treatment at some point during
      their final year of life. Few differences appeared between the substance groups
      with regard to which opioid contributed to the death. In addition to opioids,
      sedatives were present in more than 80% of the cases. Individuals whose deaths
      were buprenorphine-related had been in contact with the social services to a
      significantly lesser extent during the year prior to death. Conclusions: The
      studied population is characterised by extensive contact with care-providing
      authorities, thus providing numerous opportunities for authorities to reach this 
      group with preventive and other interventions. Few differences emerged between
      groups with regard to which opioid had contributed to the death.

TI  - Mortality in a cohort of 3.1 million children, adolescents and young adults.
PG  - 260-8
AB  - Background: Many youth deaths occur in the first year of life, from prematurity
      and anomalies. Detailing mortality after age 1 year may differentially guide
      preventive strategies in children, adolescents and young adults. Methods: A
      cohort study in Ontario, Canada comprised 3 139 698 children born from 1990 to
      2016. Adjusted HR (aHR) for death between 1 and 24 years were generated,
      comparing demographic variables and parity. Results: After a median of 13.7 years
      of follow-up, 6930 deaths occurred between ages 1 and 24 years (incidence rate
      17.0 per 100 000 person-years), peaking at age 23 years (43.7 per 100 000). The
      aHR for death was higher among males than females (1.44, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.51),
      rural versus urban areas (1.48, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.58), lowest versus highest
      income areas (1.39, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51) and at parity 1 (1.16, 95% CI 1.10 to
      1.23), parity 2 (1.34, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.45), parity 3+ (1.96, 95% CI 1.74 to
      2.21), each relative to a child without an older sibling. Among males, the
      proportion of deaths due to injury jumped from 30% before age 15 years to 65%
      thereafter, and in females, from 28% to 51%. Intentional self-harm/assault
      explained 11% of injury-related deaths among males before age 15 years, and 20%
      thereafter, with respective figures of 18% and 17% for females. Deaths outside of
      hospital increased with age, from 35% at age 1 year, to 66% at age 22 years.
      Conclusion: There is a heightened susceptibility of dying starting at age 15
      years, especially among males, from injury, and arising outside of hospital.

TI  - Equipping Farrowing Pens with Straw Improves Maternal Behavior and Physiology of 
      Min-Pig Hybrid Sows.
LID - 105
AB  - Simple Summary: This study used different sow breeds combined with an enriched
      environment to relieve stress and to improve the welfare level of sows. Both
      groups of sows were in loose-housed pens. Sows living in a barren environment
      (BE) without straw were compared with sows in farrowing crates that received 3.5 
      kg of straw daily (enriched environment (EE)). Compared with BE sows, EE sows
      showed more nest-building behavior prior to farrowing, more nursing behavior, and
      less ventral recumbency behavior during the first three days postpartum.
      Furthermore, compared with BE sows, EE sows tended to have higher concentrations 
      of serum oxytocin and prolactin, while the concentration of cortisol was lower,
      suggesting an increase in maternal behavior and a reduction of stress in this
      group. In addition, the concentration of oxytocin and both the frequency and
      duration of prepartum nest-building behavior were higher in Duroc × Min and
      Landrace × Min sows compared with Landrace × Yorkshire sows. However, the
      concentration of prolactin was significantly lower in both Duroc × Min and
      Landrace × Min sows than in Landrace × Yorkshire sows, indicating that hybrid
      sows of Min-pig inherited good maternal characteristics. Based on these results, 
      straw enrichment improved Min-pig hybrid sow welfare during farrowing and
      lactation. Abstract: This study investigated the effects of two factors, enriched
      environment (EE) and different crossbreeds, on the maternal behavior and
      physiology of Min-pig hybrid sows. The analysis was performed on a total of 72
      multiparous sows, including Duroc × Min pig (DM), Landrace × Min pig (LM), and
      Landrace × Yorkshire (LY) sows, using a total of 24 sows per cross. The sows were
      housed in two different farrowing pens, one with straw (EE) and one without straw
      (barren environment (BE)). The results showed that nest-building behavior,
      including the frequency, total duration, and bout duration, was significantly
      higher in EE sows than in BE sows (p < 0.01). The frequency and duration of
      prepartum nest-building behavior were higher in DM and LM sows than in LY sows (p
      < 0.0001). During the first three days postpartum, EE sows spent a shorter time
      in ventral recumbency compared with BE sows (p < 0.05). The oxytocin (p < 0.05)
      and prolactin (p < 0.01) concentrations of EE sows were significantly higher than
      in BE sows; however, the concentration of cortisol followed the opposite (p <
      0.01). The concentration of oxytocin was significantly higher in DM and LM sows
      than in LY sows (p < 0.01). In conclusion, both EE increased the expression of
      hormones related to parental behaviors and prenatal nesting and nursing behavior 
      of sows. Furthermore, an EE can also reduce stress in sows. Min-pig hybrids may
      inherit highly advantageous characteristics of maternal behavior of Min-pig sows.

TI  - Sensor Technologies to Manage the Physiological Traits of Chronic Pain: A Review.
LID - 365
AB  - Non-oncologic chronic pain is a common high-morbidity impairment worldwide and
      acknowledged as a condition with significant incidence on quality of life. Pain
      intensity is largely perceived as a subjective experience, what makes challenging
      its objective measurement. However, the physiological traces of pain make
      possible its correlation with vital signs, such as heart rate variability, skin
      conductance, electromyogram, etc., or health performance metrics derived from
      daily activity monitoring or facial expressions, which can be acquired with
      diverse sensor technologies and multisensory approaches. As the assessment and
      management of pain are essential issues for a wide range of clinical disorders
      and treatments, this paper reviews different sensor-based approaches applied to
      the objective evaluation of non-oncological chronic pain. The space of available 
      technologies and resources aimed at pain assessment represent a diversified set
      of alternatives that can be exploited to address the multidimensional nature of
      pain.

TI  - Exploring psychological symptoms and associated factors in patients receiving
      medication-assisted treatment for opioid-use disorder.
LID - e8
AB  - Background: Patients receiving treatment for opioid-use disorder (OUD) may
      experience psychological symptoms without meeting full criteria for psychiatric
      disorders. The impact of these symptoms on treatment outcomes is unclear. Aims:
      To determine the prevalence of psychological symptoms in a cohort of individuals 
      receiving medication-assisted treatment for OUD and explore their association
      with patient characteristics and outcomes in treatment. Method: Data were
      collected from 2788 participants receiving ongoing treatment for OUD recruited in
      two Canadian prospective cohort studies. The Maudsley Addiction Profile
      psychological symptoms subscale was administered to all participants via
      face-to-face interviews. A subset of participants (n = 666) also received
      assessment for psychiatric disorders with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
      Interview. We used linear regression analysis to explore factors associated with 
      psychological symptom score. Results: The mean psychological symptom score was
      12.6/40 (s.d. = 9.2). Participants with psychiatric comorbidity had higher scores
      than those without (mean 16.8 v. 8.6, P<0.001) and 31% of those with psychiatric 
      comorbidity reported suicidal ideation. Higher psychological symptom score was
      associated with female gender (B = 1.59, 95% CI 0.92–2.25, P<0.001),
      antidepressant prescription (B = 4.35, 95% CI 3.61–5.09, P<0.001), percentage of 
      opioid-positive urine screens (B = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01–0.03, P<0.001), and use of
      non-opioid substances (B = 1.92, 95% CI 0.89–2.95, P<0.001). Marriage and
      employment were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusions:
      Psychological symptoms are associated with treatment outcomes in this population 
      and the prevalence of suicidal ideation is an area of concern. Our findings
      highlight the ongoing need to optimise integrated mental health and addictions
      services for patients with OUD.

TI  - Non-Operating Room Anesthesia: Patient Selection and Special Considerations.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Non-operating room anesthesia (NORA) represents a growing field of medicine with 
      an increasing trend in the number of cases performed over the previous decade. As
      a result, anesthesia providers will need to enhance their familiarity with the
      resources, personnel, and environment outside of the operating room. Anesthesia
      delivery in NORA settings should be held with the same high-quality standards as 
      that within the operating room. This review looks at special considerations in
      patient selection and the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative
      periods. In addition, there is a discussion on the unique aspects of specific
      NORA areas and the considerations that come with them.

TI  - A multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial of rifampin to reduce pedal
      amputations for osteomyelitis in veterans with diabetes (VA INTREPID).
LID - 23
AB  - Background: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus continues to inexorably rise in
      the United States and throughout the world. Lower limb amputations are a
      devastating comorbid complication of diabetes mellitus. Osteomyelitis increases
      the risk of amputation fourfold and commonly presages death.Antimicrobial therapy
      for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) varies greatly, indicating that high
      quality data are needed to inform clinical decision making. Several small trials 
      have indicated that the addition of rifampin to backbone antimicrobial regimens
      for osteomyelitis outside the setting of the diabetic foot results in 28 to 42%
      higher cure rates. Methods/design: This is a prospective, randomized,
      double-blind investigation of the addition of 6 weeks of rifampin, 600 mg daily, 
      vs. matched placebo (riboflavin) to standard-of-care, backbone antimicrobial
      therapy for DFO. The study population are patients enrolled in Veteran Health
      Administration (VHA), ages ≥18 and ≤ 89 years with diabetes mellitus and definite
      or probable osteomyelitis of the foot for whom an extended course of oral or
      intravenous antibiotics is planned. The primary endpoint is amputation-free
      survival. The primary hypothesis is that using rifampin as adjunctive therapy
      will lower the hazard rate compared with the group that does not use rifampin as 
      adjunctive therapy. The primary hypothesis will be tested by means of a two-sided
      log-rank test with a 5% significance level. The test has 90% power to detect a
      hazard ratio of 0.67 or lower with a total of 880 study participants followed on 
      average for 1.8 years. Discussion: VA INTREPID will test if a rifampin-adjunctive
      antibiotic regimen increases amputation-free survival in patients seeking care in
      the VHA with DFO. A positive finding and its adoption by clinicians would reduce 
      lower extremity amputations and their associated physical and emotional impact
      and reduce mortality for Veterans and for the general population with diabetic
      foot osteomyelitis. Given that rifampin-adjunctive regimens are currently
      employed for therapy for the majority of DFO cases in Europe, and only in a small
      minority of cases in the United States, the trial results will impact therapeutic
      decisions, even if the null hypothesis is not rejected. Trial registration:

TI  - Anaphylaxis-Induced Atrial Fibrillation and Anesthesia: Pathophysiologic and
      Therapeutic Considerations.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in western society
      affecting more than 35 million individuals worldwide annually. It is a common
      postoperative complication and may also occur spontaneously during general and
      local anesthesia administration. Aging, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
      cardiovascular diseases including cardiomyopathies, congenital cardiac anomalies,
      heart failure, myocardial ischemia, pericarditis, previous cardiac surgery,
      vascular disease, and valvular heart disease are some correlated factors. Beyond 
      age, increased incidence of atrial fibrillation has been correlated to autoimmune
      system activation as it is the underlying mechanism of persistent atrial
      fibrillation development. Current research supports an association between the
      complement system activation and lymphocyte-pro-inflammatory cytokines release
      with the cardiac conduction system and atrial fibrosis. The loss of CD28 antigen 
      from CD4+ CD28+ T lymphocytes seems to play a major role in atrial fibrillation
      development and prognosis. Except atrial fibrillation, a variety of additional
      electrocardiographic changes, resembling those with digitalis intoxication may
      accompany anaphylaxis and particularly Kounis syndrome. Histamine is one
      well-known mediator in allergic and inflammatory conditions as physiologically
      regulates several cardiovascular and endothelial functions with arrhythmogenic
      potential. The increased oxidative stress, measured by the redox potentials of
      glutathione, has been correlated with atrial fibrillation incidence and
      prevalence. The use of antazoline, a first-generation antihistamine agent used
      for rapid conversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation in patients with
      preserved left ventricular function and for rapid atrial fibrillation termination
      during accessory pathway ablation denotes that anaphylaxis-induced histamine
      production could be the cause of atrial fibrillation at least in some instances. 
      The anaphylaxis diagnosis in anesthesia can be challenging owing to the absence
      of cutaneous manifestetions such as flushing, urticaria, or angioedema.
      Anticoagulation for stroke prevention, rate and rhythm control medications,
      invasive methods such as radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation of pulmonary
      veins as well surgical ablation constitute the treatment basis of atrial
      fibrillation. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of atrial fibrillation by
      cardiologists, anesthesiologists and surgeons, as well as potential treatments,
      to optimize care is of paramount importance.

TI  - The Use of Opioids and Antipsychotics in Elderly with Dementia – Have Opioids
      Replaced Antipsychotics in Treating Behavioral Symptoms in Dementia?
PG  - 259-67
AB  - Background:: Opioids are used with increasing frequency. Elderly with dementia
      are prescribed opioids more frequent than elderly without. One possible
      explanation is that opioids may be used not only to treat pain but also
      behavioral symptoms. Objective:: To test the hypothesis that strong opioid use,
      especially transdermal formulations, had increased, especially in elderly with
      dementia, in parallel with a decrease in antipsychotic use. Methods::
      Population-based cross-sectional study conducted using nationwide Danish
      registers with data on Denmark’s entire elderly population age ≥65 (2000:
      n = 802,106; 2015: n = 1,056,476). The registers were used to identify elderly
      with and without dementia and filled prescriptions for opioids and
      antipsychotics. Annual prevalence of opioid and antipsychotic use from 2000–2015 
      was calculated. Results:: Prevalence of opioid use increased by 35% (24.2 to
      32.5%) among elderly with dementia and by 13% among elderly without (14.9 to
      16.8%) from 2000–2015. The disproportionate increase in opioid use among elderly 
      with dementia was mainly driven by an increase in strong opioids (dementia: 11.7 
      to 23.1%; without dementia: 5.9 to 7.4%). Use of antipsychotics decreased during 
      the same period (dementia: 31.3 to 19.3%; no dementia: 4.5 to 2.7%). Conclusion::
      From 2000–2015, use of opioids among the elderly increased with a
      disproportionately higher increase among elderly with dementia. The parallel
      decrease in the use of antipsychotics may suggest that opioids to some extent
      have replaced antipsychotics in managing behavioral symptoms, despite safety
      concerns and lack of evidence for effect of opioids. Future research should focus
      on potential risks associated with increased opioid use.

TI  - Long-Term Trends in Postoperative Opioid Prescribing, 1994 to 2014.
LID - e19.00171
AB  - Opioids are routinely prescribed to manage acute postoperative pain, but changes 
      in postoperative opioid prescribing associated with the marketing of long-acting 
      opioids such as OxyContin have not been described in the surgical
      cohort.Methods:: Using a large commercial claims data set, we studied
      postoperative opioid prescribing after selected common surgical procedures
      between 1994 and 2014. For each procedure and year, we calculated the mean
      postoperative morphine milligram equivalents (MME) filled on the index
      prescription and assessed the proportion of patients who filled a high-dose
      prescription (≥350 MME). We reported changes in postoperative opioid prescribing 
      over time and identified predictors of filling a high-dose postoperative opioid
      prescription. Results:: We identified 1,321,264 adult patients undergoing
      selected common surgical procedures between 1994 and 2014, of whom 80.3% filled a
      postoperative opioid prescription. One in five surgery patients filled a
      high-dose postoperative opioid prescription. Between 1994 and 2014, the mean MME 
      filled increased by 145%, 84%, and 85% for lumbar laminectomy/laminotomy, total
      knee arthroplasty, and total hip arthroplasty, respectively. The procedures most 
      likely to be associated with a high-dose opioid fill were all orthopaedic
      procedures (AOR 5.20 to 7.55, P < 0.001 for all). Patients whose postoperative
      opioid prescription included a long-acting formulation had the highest odds of
      filling a prescription that exceeded 350 MME (AOR 32.01, 95% CI, 30.23–33.90).
      Discussion:: After the US introduction of long-acting opioids such as OxyContin, 
      postoperative opioid prescribing in commercially insured patients increased in
      parallel with broader US opioid-prescribing trends, most notably among patients
      undergoing orthopaedic surgical procedures. The increase in the mean annual MME
      filled starting in the late 1990s was driven in part by the higher proportion of 
      long-acting opioid formulations on the index postoperative opioid prescription
      filled by orthopaedic surgery patients.

TI  - Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Neither Improves Survival nor Reduces Myocardial 
      or Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation
      (TAVI).
LID - 160
AB  - Background: Peri-interventional myocardial injury occurs frequently during
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We assessed the effect of remote 
      ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on myocardial injury, acute kidney injury (AKIN) 
      and 6-month mortality in patients undergoing TAVI. Methods: We performed a
      prospective single-center controlled trial. Sixty-six patients treated with RIPC 
      prior to TAVI were enrolled in the study and were matched to a control group by
      propensity-score. RIPC was applied to the upper extremity using a conventional
      tourniquet. Myocardial injury was assessed using high-sensitive troponin-T
      (hsTnT), and kidney injury was assessed using serum creatinine levels. Data were 
      compared with the Wilcoxon-Rank and McNemar tests. Mortality was analysed with
      the log-rank test. Results: TAVI led to a significant rise of hsTnT across all
      patients (p < 0.001). No significant inter-group difference in maximum troponin
      release or areas-under-the-curve was detected. Medtronic CoreValve and Edwards
      Sapien valves showed similar peri-interventional troponin kinetics and patients
      receiving neither valve did benefit from RIPC. AKIN occurred in one RIPC patient 
      and four non-RIPC patients (p = 0.250). No significant difference in 6-month
      mortality was observed. No adverse events related to RIPC were recorded.
      Conclusion: Our data do not show a beneficial role of RIPC in TAVI patients for
      cardio- or renoprotection, or improved survival.

      enolase (NSE) and lactate in cardiac arrest survivors treated with targeted
      temperature management (TTM) and to investigate whether a combination of NSE and 
      lactate could increase prognostic information. This observational, retrospective,
      cohort study was conducted between January 2013 and December 2018; data were
      extracted from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry. We collected serial
      serum NSE and lactate levels during TTM. The primary endpoint was poor
      neurological outcome at 28 days from cardiac arrest. Of all 160 included
      patients, 98 (61.3%) had poor neurological outcomes. Areas under the curves
      (AUCs) for NSE were 0.797, 0.871, and 0.843 at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively
      (all p < 0.05). AUCs for lactate were 0.669, 0.578, 0.634, and 0.620 at 0, 24,
      48, and 72 h, respectively (all p < 0.05). Although the combination of initial
      lactate and NSE at 48 h yielded the highest discovered AUC (0.877) it was not
      statistically different from that for the 48 h NSE alone (p = 0.692). During the 
      TTM, NSE at 48 h from cardiac arrest was the most robust prognostic marker in
      comatose cardiac arrest survivors. However, a combination of the 48 h NSE with
      lactate did not increase the prognostic information.

TI  - A Case of Kratom-induced Seizures.
LID - e6588
AB  - Kratom or Mitragna speciosa is a tropical tree that is indigenous to Southeast
      Asia, where it has been used for various medicinal reasons. In the West, it is
      used in the self-treatment of opioid withdrawal, pain, and a variety of mood and 
      anxiety states. Two active ingredients in kratom are mitragynine and
      7-hydroxymitragynine, which have affinity at the mu-opioid receptor among others.
      Kratom is easily available over the Internet and its use is increasing in the
      United States. It is currently listed by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a
      drug of concern. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration started issuing a
      series of warnings about kratom, and by early 2018, it released a statement
      identifying 44 deaths related to kratom use. The Centers for Disease Control and 
      Prevention has also reported 91 deaths directly linked to kratom use in 2019.
      Although its safety profile needs additional research for clarification, there
      have been reports of kratom-induced or kratom-related respiratory depression,
      hypothyroidism, secondary hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, psychosis, and
      seizures. We report a case of kratom-induced tonic-clonic seizures in a
      27-year-old Caucasian male with a psychiatric history of anxiety,
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine use disorder, and opioid
      use disorder. He was hospitalized after a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure. There
      was no significant metabolic abnormality on laboratory testing. Spinal cord and
      brain imaging were unremarkable, whereas his urine toxicology was positive for
      opioids only, which was likely a false-positive result due to cross-reactivity
      with his sleeping aids. He was evaluated by the Consultation-Liaison
      Psychiatry team for psychotic symptoms. On evaluation, the patient’s psychosis
      had resolved, but he endorsed racing thoughts, significant anxiety, and insomnia.
      He admitted to drinking three to four 8-mL bottles of Kratom daily for
      one-and-a-half years to self-medicate his anxiety after losing his health
      insurance. In the hospital, he was treated with anxiolytics, counseled to abstain
      from Kratom use, and was referred for substance use disorder treatment. This case
      highlights the life-threatening complications of Kratom that is easily available 
      online.

TI  - Respiratory Rate Monitoring in Clinical Environments with a Contactless
      Ultra-Wideband Impulse Radar-based Sensor System.
PG  - 3366-75
AB  - Respiratory rate is an extremely important but poorly monitored vital sign for
      medical conditions. Current modalities for respiratory monitoring are suboptimal.
      This paper presents a proof of concept of a new algorithm using a contactless
      ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radar-based sensor to detect respiratory rate in
      both a laboratory setting and in a two-subject case study in the Emergency
      Department. This novel approach has shown correlation with manual respiratory
      rate in the laboratory setting and shows promise in Emergency Department
      subjects. In order to improve respiratory rate monitoring, the UWB technology is 
      also able to localize subject movement throughout the room. This technology has
      potential for utilization both in and out of the hospital environments to improve
      monitoring and to prevent morbidity and mortality from a variety of medical
      conditions associated with changes in respiratory rate.

      Enhance Access to Treatment Following Near-Fatal Opioid Overdose.
PG  - 3488-96
AB  - The opioid epidemic is a growing public health emergency in the United States,
      with deaths from opioid overdose having increased five-fold since 1999. Emergency
      departments (EDs) are the primary sites of medical care after near-fatal opioid
      overdose but are poorly equipped to provide adequate substance use treatment
      planning prior to discharge. In many underserved locales, limited access to
      clinicians trained in addiction medicine and behavioral health exacerbates this
      disparity. In an effort to improve post-overdose care in the ED, we developed a
      telemedicine protocol to facilitate timely access to substance use disorder
      evaluations. In this paper, we describe the conception and refinement of the
      telemedicine program, our experience with the first 20 participants, and
      potential implications of the platform on health disparities for individuals with
      opioid use disorder.

TI  - Analysis of Anesthesia Methods in Percutaneous Kyphoplasty for Treatment of
      Vertebral Compression Fractures.
LID - 3965961
AB  - Aim: Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) is a routine operation for the treatment of
      vertebral compression fracture (VCF). Both local anesthesia and general
      anesthesia are widely used for PKP. However, which type of anesthesia is better
      for PKP still remains uncertain. This study aimed to find out whether local
      anesthesia or general anesthesia is more suitable for PKP. Methods: This is a
      retrospective clinical trial. A total of 85 single-level VCF patients who
      received PKP 12 months ago were recruited in this study. 45 patients who received
      local anesthesia were in group L, and 40 patients with general anesthesia were in
      group G. Clinical, radiological, and economic data between the two groups were
      collected. Results: No difference was found on preoperative data between the two 
      groups. The duration of operation time in group L was longer than that in group
      G. Within 12 months after PKP, more complications happened in group G than those 
      in group L. Results: No difference was found on preoperative data between the two
      groups. The duration of operation time in group L was longer than that in group
      G. Within 12 months after PKP, more complications happened in group G than those 
      in group L. Conclusion: Both local anesthesia and general anesthesia were
      reliable for PKP. However, local anesthesia was more efficient and safer with
      less expense and more bearable pain when compared with general anesthesia.

TI  - Systemic lidocaine versus ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block for
      postoperative analgesia: A comparative randomised study in bariatric surgical
      patients.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - Background and Aims:: The multimodal analgesia strategies to minimise
      opioid-related side effects are highly desirable in bariatric surgical
      procedures. We evaluated the efficacy of ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis 
      plane (USG-TAP) block and intravenous lidocaine for postoperative analgesia in
      obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Methods:: We studied 56
      patients with body mass index >35 kg/m2. They were randomly allocated to
      Lidocaine group (Group A) and USG-TAP group (Group B). Group A patients were
      given intravenous Lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) bolus followed by (1.5 mg/kg/h) infusion.
      Group B patients were given ultrasound-guided bilateral TAP block using 20 cc of 
      0.375% ropivacaine each side. Postoperative numeric rating pain scale score (NRS)
      hours were compared. Other parameters compared were total fentanyl requirement,
      sedation score, postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV) score and patient
      satisfaction score. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
      Results:: The patient in the Group A had lower resting NRS score (P < 0.05)
      postoperatively and less fentanyl consumption (P < 0.001) than in Group B. The
      difference in the sedation scores (P = 0.161) and PONV (P = 0.293) score was
      found to be statistically insignificant between Group A and B. The difference
      between the two groups was statistically significant with respect to patient
      satisfaction score with majority of patients having an excellent patient
      satisfaction score in Group A as compared to Group B. Conclusion:: Intravenous
      Lidocaine as part of multimodal analgesic technique in obese patients undergoing 
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery improves pain score and reduces opioid requirement
      as compared to USG-TAP Block.

TI  - Enhanced External Counterpulsation Efficacy on Exercise Endurance in COPD
      Patients and Healthy Subjects: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - Purpose: Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is popular in China for the
      treatment of coronary heart diseases, but it may be an effective treatment for
      other populations. This study aimed to explore the effect of EECP on exercise
      endurance of healthy people and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      patients and provide intervention measures to improve their physical condition.
      Patients and methods: Patients were enrolled in this pilot randomized controlled 
      trial at Jiangbin Hospital, China, between March 1st and May 30th, 2018. They
      were randomly divided into the EECP and non-EECP groups. According to their
      maximal oxygen uptake, the volunteers were also sub-grouped into the normal, low 
      exercise endurance, and COPD subgroups. Differences in exercise endurance were
      evaluated between the EECP and non-EECP groups before and after treatment.
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testng included anaerobic threshold oxygen uptake
      (AT-VO2Kg), maximum oxygen uptake (Max-VO2Kg), anaerobic threshold pulse
      (AT-O2puls), anaerobic threshold metabolic equivalent (AT-Mets), and maximum
      metabolic equivalent (Max-Mets). Results: 72 volunteers were enrolled. The EECP
      and non-EECP groups were similar in terms of age, sex, body mass index, blood
      pressure, heart rate, breathing frequency, AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg, AT-O2puls,
      AT-Mets, and Max-Mets (P > 0.05) before treatment. EECP significantly improved
      AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg, AT-O2puls, AT-Mets, and Max-Mets compared with the non-EECP 
      group (P<0.05). When analyzed according to sub-groups, the AT-VO2Kg, Max-VO2Kg,
      AT-O2puls, AT-Mets, and Max-Mets of the normal, low exercise endurance, and COPD 
      subgroups were all significantly increased after EECP (P<0.05). Conclusion: EECP 
      significantly improved the exercise endurance of normal adults, low endurance
      adults, and COPD patients. Registration number: ChiCTR1900021993.

TI  - Identifying appropriate outcomes to help evaluate the impact of the Canadian
      Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for Non-Cancer Pain.
LID - 6
AB  - Background: The Canadian Guideline for Safe and Effective Use of Opioids for
      Chronic Non-Cancer Pain (COG) was developed in response to increasing rates of
      opioid-related hospital visits and deaths in Canada, and uncertain benefits of
      opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Following publication, we developed a
      list of evaluable outcomes to assess the impact of this guideline on practice and
      patient outcomes. Methods: A working group at the National Pain Centre at
      McMaster University used a modified Delphi process to construct a list of
      clinical and patient outcomes important in assessing the uptake and application
      of the COG. An advisory group then reviewed this list to determine the relevance 
      and feasibility of each outcome, and identified potential data sources. This
      feedback was reviewed by the National Faculty for the Guideline, and a National
      Advisory Group that included the creators of the COG, resulting in the final list
      of 5 priority outcomes. Results: Five outcomes were judged clinically important
      and feasible to measure: 1) Effects of opioids for CNCP on quality of life, 2)
      Assessment of patient’s risk of addiction before starting opioid therapy, 3)
      Monitoring patients on opioid therapy for aberrant drug-related behaviour, 4)
      Mortality rates associated with prescription opioid overdose and 5) Use of
      treatment agreements with patients before initiating opioid therapy for CNCP.
      Data sources for these outcomes included patient’s medical charts, e-Opioid
      Manager, prescription monitoring programs and administrative databases.
      Conclusion: Measuring the impact of best practice guidelines is infrequently
      done. Future research should consider capturing the five outcomes identified in
      this study to evaluate the impact of the COG in promoting evidence-based use of
      opioids for CNCP.

TI  - Why Are Women Prone to Restless Legs Syndrome?
LID - 368
AB  - Restless legs syndrome is a relatively common neurologic disorder considerably
      more prevalent in women than in men. It is characterized by an
      inactivity-induced, mostly nocturnal, uncomfortable sensation in the legs and an 
      urge to move them to make the disagreeable sensation disappear. Some known genes 
      contribute to this disorder and the same genes contribute to an overlapping
      condition—periodic leg movements that occur during sleep and result in insomnia. 
      Dopamine and glutamate transmission in the central nervous system are involved in
      the pathophysiology, and an iron deficiency has been shown in region-specific
      areas of the brain. A review of the literature shows that pregnant women are at
      particular risk and that increased parity is a predisposing factor.
      Paradoxically, menopause increases the prevalence and severity of symptoms. This 
      implies a complex role for reproductive hormones. It suggests that changes rather
      than absolute levels of estrogen may be responsible for the initiation of
      symptoms. Both iron (at relatively low levels in women) and estrogen (at
      relatively high oscillating levels in women) influence dopamine and glutamate
      transmission, which may help to explain women’s vulnerability to this condition. 
      The syndrome is comorbid with several disorders (such as migraine, depression,
      and anxiety) to which women are particularly prone. This implies that the
      comorbid condition or its treatment, or both, contribute to the much higher
      prevalence in women than in men of restless legs syndrome.

PG  - 45S-52S
AB  - Study design:: Invited narrative review. Objectives:: The aim of this review was 
      to summarize current literature regarding risk factors that surgeons can optimize
      in the preoperative setting in the spinal surgery patient, in order to reduce
      complications and improve patient-reported outcomes. Methods:: Review of the
      relevant literature by the authors. Results:: Modifiable risk factors identified 
      relative to the patient include obesity, malnutrition/nutrient deficiency,
      diabetes/hyperglycemia, preoperative anemia, vitamin D/DEXA (dual-energy
      radiograph absorptiometry), nicotine use/smoking, and opioid use/psychosocial
      factors. Conclusion:: By maximizing a patient’s physiological and psychological
      status prior to elective spine surgery, we may move closer to achieving the goals
      of value-based care: improving patient-reported outcomes while decreasing the
      cost of care.

TI  - Circadian disruption of core body temperature in trauma patients: a single-center
      retrospective observational study.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: Circadian clock alterations were poorly reported in trauma patients, 
      although they have a critical role in human physiology. Core body temperature is 
      a clinical variable regulated by the circadian clock. Our objective was to
      identify the circadian temperature disruption in trauma patients and to determine
      whether these disruptions were associated with the 28-day mortality rate.
      Methods: A retrospective and observational single-center cohort study was
      conducted. All adult severe trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit
      of Aix Marseille University, North Hospital, from November 2013 to February 2018,
      were evaluated. The variations of core body temperature for each patient were
      analyzed between days 2 and 3 after intensive care unit admission. Core body
      temperature variations were defined by three parameters: mesor, amplitude, and
      period. A logistic regression model was used to determine the variables
      influencing these three parameters. A survival analysis was performed assessing
      the association between core body temperature rhythm disruption and 28-day
      mortality rate. A post hoc subgroup analysis focused on the patients with head
      trauma. Results: Among the 1584 screened patients, 248 were included in this
      study. The period differed from 24 h in 177 (71%) patients. The mesor value (°C) 
      was associated with body mass index and ketamine use. Amplitude (°C) was
      associated with ketamine use only. The 28-day mortality rate was 18%. For all
      trauma patients, age, body mass index, intracranial hypertension, and amplitude
      were independent risk factors. The patients with a mesor value < 36.9 °C
      (p < 0.001) and an amplitude > 0.6 °C (p < 0.001) had a higher 28-day mortality
      rate. Among the patients with head trauma, mesor and amplitude were identified as
      independent risk factors (HR = 0.40, 95% CI [0.23–0.70], p = 0.001 and HR = 4.73,
      95% CI [1.38–16.22], p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our results highlight an association
      between core body temperature circadian alteration and 28-day mortality rate.
      This association was more pronounced in the head trauma patients than in the
      non-head trauma patients. Further studies are needed to show a causal link and
      consider possible interventions.

TI  - Patients with more comorbidities have better detection of chronic conditions, but
      poorer management and control: findings from six middle-income countries.
LID - 9
AB  - Background: The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is rising rapidly in
      middle-income countries (MICs), where NCDs are often undiagnosed, untreated and
      uncontrolled. How comorbidity impacts diagnosis, treatment, and control of NCDs
      is an emerging area of research inquiry and have important clinical implications 
      as highlighted in the recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
      guidelines for treating patients suffering from multiple NCDs. This is the first 
      study to examine the association between increasing numbers of comorbidities with
      being undiagnosed, untreated, and uncontrolled for NCDs, in 6 large MICs.
      Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organisation Study of
      Global Ageing and Adult Health (WHO SAGE) Wave 1 (2007–10), which consisted of
      adults aged ≥18 years from 6 populous MICs, including China, Ghana, India,
      Mexico, Russia and South Africa (overall n = 41, 557). Results: A higher number
      of comorbidities was associated with better odds of diagnosis for hypertension,
      angina, and arthritis, and higher odds of having treatment for hypertension and
      angina. However, more comorbidities were associated with increased odds of
      uncontrolled hypertension, angina, arthritis, and asthma. Comorbidity with
      concordant conditions was associated with improved diagnosis and treatment of
      hypertension and angina. Conclusion: Patients with more comorbidities have better
      diagnosis of chronic conditions, but this does not translate into better
      management and control of these conditions. Patients with multiple NCDs are high 
      users of health services and are at an increased risk of adverse health outcomes.
      Hence, improving their access to care is a priority for healthcare systems.

TI  - Brainstem dysfunction in critically ill patients.
LID - 5
AB  - The brainstem conveys sensory and motor inputs between the spinal cord and the
      brain, and contains nuclei of the cranial nerves. It controls the sleep-wake
      cycle and vital functions via the ascending reticular activating system and the
      autonomic nuclei, respectively. Brainstem dysfunction may lead to sensory and
      motor deficits, cranial nerve palsies, impairment of consciousness, dysautonomia,
      and respiratory failure. The brainstem is prone to various primary and secondary 
      insults, resulting in acute or chronic dysfunction. Of particular importance for 
      characterizing brainstem dysfunction and identifying the underlying etiology are 
      a detailed clinical examination, MRI, neurophysiologic tests such as brainstem
      auditory evoked potentials, and an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid. Detection
      of brainstem dysfunction is challenging but of utmost importance in comatose and 
      deeply sedated patients both to guide therapy and to support outcome prediction. 
      In the present review, we summarize the neuroanatomy, clinical syndromes, and
      diagnostic techniques of critical illness-associated brainstem dysfunction for
      the critical care setting.

LID - 15
AB  - Background: In pharmacological conditioning associations are formed between the
      effects of medication and contextual factors related to the medication.
      Pharmacological conditioning with placebo medication can result in comparable
      treatment effects and reduced side effects compared to regular treatment in
      various clinical populations, and may be applied to achieve enhanced drug
      effects. In the current study protocol, pharmacological conditioning is applied
      to achieve enhanced treatment effects in patients with recent-onset rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). The results from this study broaden the knowledge on the
      potential of pharmacological conditioning and provide a potential innovative
      treatment option to optimize long-term pharmacological treatment effectiveness
      for patients with inflammatory conditions, such as recent-onset RA. Methods: A
      multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial is conducted in patients with
      recent-onset RA. Participants start on standardized pharmacological treatment for
      16 weeks, which consists of methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg/week and a tapered schedule 
      of prednisone 60 mg or 30 mg. After 4 months, participants in clinical remission 
      (based on the rheumatologist’s opinion and a targeted score below 1.6 on a
      44-joint disease activity score (DAS44)) are randomized to 1 of 2 groups: (1) the
      control group (C), which continues with a standardized treatment schedule of MTX 
      15 mg/week or (2) the pharmacological conditioning group (PC), which receives an 
      MTX treatment schedule in alternating high and low dosages. In the case of
      persistent clinical remission after 8 months, treatment is tapered and
      discontinued linearly in the C group and variably in the PC group. Both groups
      receive the same cumulative amount of MTX during each period. Logistic regression
      analysis is used to compare the proportion of participants with drug-free
      clinical remission after 12 months between the C group and the PC group.
      Secondary outcome measures include clinical functioning, laboratory assessments, 
      and self-reported measures after each 4-month period up to 18 months after study 
      start. Discussion: The results from this study broaden the knowledge on the
      potential of pharmacological conditioning and provide a potential innovative
      treatment option to optimize long-term pharmacological treatment effectiveness in
      patients with inflammatory conditions, such as recent-onset RA. Trial

TI  - A call for consensus in defining efficacy in clinical trials for opioid
      addiction: combined results from a systematic review and qualitative study in
      patients receiving pharmacological assisted therapy for opioid use disorder.
LID - 30
AB  - Background: Given the complex nature of opioid addiction treatment and the rising
      number of available opioid substitution and antagonist therapies (OSAT), there is
      no ‘gold standard’ measure of treatment effectiveness, and each successive trial 
      measures a different set of outcomes which reflect success in arbitrary or
      opportune terms. We sought to describe the variation in current outcomes employed
      across clinical trials for opioid addiction, as well as determine whether a
      discrepancy exists between the treatment targets that patients consider important
      and how treatment effectiveness is measured in the literature. Methods: We
      searched nine commonly used databases (e.g., EMBASE, MEDLINE) from inception to
      August 1, 2015. Outcomes used across trials were extracted and categorized
      according to previously established domains. To evaluate patient-reported goals
      of treatment, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 adults undergoing
      methadone treatment. Results: We identified 60 trials eligible for inclusion.
      Once outcomes were categorized into eight broad domains (e.g.,
      abstinence/substance abuse), we identified 21 specific outcomes with furthermore 
      53 subdomains and 118 measurements. Continued opioid use and treatment retention 
      were the most commonly reported measures (46%, n = 28). The majority of patients 
      agreed that abstinence from opioids was a primary goal in their treatment,
      although they also stressed goals under-reported in clinical trials. Conclusions:
      There is inconsistency in the measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of
      OSATs. Individual and population level decision making is being guided by a
      standard of effect considered useful to researchers yet in direct conflict with
      what patients deem important. Trial registration: PROSPERO, CRD42013006507.

TI  - Potential of animal models for advancing the understanding and treatment of pain 
      in Parkinson’s disease.
LID - 1
AB  - Pain is a commonly occurring non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD).
      Treatment of pain in PD remains less than optimal and a better understanding of
      the underlying mechanisms would facilitate discovery of improved analgesics.
      Animal models of PD have already proven helpful for furthering the understanding 
      and treatment of motor symptoms of PD, but could these models offer insight into 
      pain in PD? This review addresses the current position regarding pain in
      preclinical models of PD, covering the face and predictive validity of existing
      models and their use so far in advancing understanding of the mechanisms
      contributing to pain in PD. While pain itself is not usually measured in animals,
      nociception in the form of thermal, mechanical or chemical nociceptive thresholds
      offers a useful readout, given reduced nociceptive thresholds are commonly seen
      in PD patients. Animal models of PD including the reserpine-treated rat and
      neurodegenerative models such as the MPTP-treated mouse and 6-hydroxydopamine
      (6-OHDA)-treated rat each exhibit reduced nociceptive thresholds, supporting face
      validity of these models. Furthermore, some interventions known clinically to
      relieve pain in PD, such as dopaminergic therapies and deep brain stimulation of 
      the subthalamic nucleus, restore nociceptive thresholds in one or more models,
      supporting their predictive validity. Mechanistic insight gained already includes
      involvement of central and spinal dopamine and opioid systems. Moving forward,
      these preclinical models should advance understanding of the cellular and
      molecular mechanisms underlying pain in PD and provide test beds for examining
      the efficacy of novel analgesics to better treat this debilitating non-motor
      symptom.

TI  - Adverse drug reactions in primary care: a scoping review.
LID - 5
AB  - Background: Medication-related adverse events, or adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
      are harmful events caused by medication. ADRs could have profound effects on the 
      patients’ quality of life, as well as creating an increased burden on the
      healthcare system. ADRs are one of the rising causes of morbidity and mortality
      internationally, and will continue to be a significant public health issue with
      the increased complexity in medication, to treat various diseases in an aging
      society. This scoping review aims to provide a detailed map of the most common
      adverse drug reactions experienced in primary healthcare setting, the drug
      classes that are most commonly associated with different levels/types of adverse 
      drug reactions, causes of ADRs, their prevalence and consequences of experiencing
      ADRs. Methods: We systematically reviewed electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE,
      Embase, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and
      Scopus. In addition, the National Patient Safety Foundation Bibliography and the 
      Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and Patient Safety Net Bibliography
      were searched. Studies published from 1990 onwards until December 7, 2018 were
      included as the incidence of reporting drug reactions were not prevalent before
      1990. We only include studies published in English. Results: The final search
      yielded a total of 19 citations for inclusion published over a 15-year period
      that primarily focused on investigating the different types of adverse drug
      reactions in primary healthcare. The most causes of adverse events were related
      to drug related and allergies. Idiosyncratic adverse reactions were not very
      commonly reported. The most common adverse drug reactions reported in the studies
      included in this review were those that are associated with the central nervous
      system, gastrointestinal system and cardiovascular system. Several classes of
      medications were reported to be associated with adverse events. Conclusion: This 
      scoping review identified that the most causes of ADRs were drug related and due 
      to allergies. Idiosyncratic adverse reactions were not very commonly reported in 
      the literature. This is mainly because it is hard to predict and these reactions 
      are not associated with drug doses or routes of administration. The most common
      ADRs reported in the studies included in this review were those that are
      associated with the central nervous system, gastrointestinal system and
      cardiovascular system. Several classes of medications were reported to be
      associated with ADRs.

TI  - Mu Opioid Receptor 1 (MOR-1) Expression in Colorectal Cancer and Oncological
      Long-Term Outcomes: A Five-Year Retrospective Longitudinal Cohort Study.
LID - 134
AB  - Preclinical evidence has shown increased expression of mu opioid receptor 1
      (MOR-1) in colorectal cancer although its association with disease-free and
      overall survival (DFS and OS) has not been investigated. We hypothesized that
      MOR-1 was overexpressed in tumor samples compared to normal tissue and this was
      associated with decreased DFS and OS. We carried out a retrospective study
      assessing the association of MOR-1 tumor expression with long-term outcomes by
      immunohistochemistry in normal and tumor samples from 174 colorectal cancer
      patients. The primary endpoint was five years of DFS. Secondary endpoints were
      five years of OS, the difference in MOR-1 expression between normal and tumor
      tissue and the occurrence of postoperative complications. Multivariable Cox
      regression showed no significant association between MOR-1 expression and DFS (HR
      0.791, 95% CI 0.603–1.039, p = 0.092). MOR-1 expression was higher in tumor
      tissue compared to non-tumor tissue. No associations were found between MOR-1
      expression and OS or postoperative complications. These findings suggest that
      although MOR-1 is over-expressed in colorectal cancer samples there is no
      association to increased risk of recurrence or mortality. Future studies are
      warranted to elucidate the role of cancer stage, genetic polymorphism, and
      quantitative assessment of MOR-1 over-expression on long-term outcomes in
      colorectal cancer.

TI  - Multifactorial Scores and Biomarkers of Prognosis of Acute Pancreatitis:
      Applications to Research and Practice.
LID - 338
AB  - Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe inflammation of the pancreas presented with
      sudden onset and severe abdominal pain with a high morbidity and mortality rate, 
      if accompanied by severe local and systemic complications. Numerous studies have 
      been published about the pathogenesis of AP; however, the precise mechanism
      behind this pathology remains unclear. Extensive research conducted over the last
      decades has demonstrated that the first 24 h after symptom onset are critical for
      the identification of patients who are at risk of developing complications or
      death. The identification of these subgroups of patients is crucial in order to
      start an aggressive approach to prevent mortality. In this sense and to avoid
      unnecessary overtreatment, thereby reducing the financial implications, the
      proper identification of mild disease is also important and necessary. A large
      number of multifactorial scoring systems and biochemical markers are described to
      predict the severity. Despite recent progress in understanding the
      pathophysiology of AP, more research is needed to enable a faster and more
      accurate prediction of severe AP. This review provides an overview of the
      available multifactorial scoring systems and biochemical markers for predicting
      severe AP with a special focus on their advantages and limitations.

TI  - The analgesic efficacy and safety of peri-articular injection versus
      intra-articular injection in one-stage bilateral total knee arthroplasty: a
      randomized controlled trial.
LID - 2
AB  - Background: As an essential component of multimodal analgesia approaches after
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA), local infiltration analgesia (LIA) can be
      classified into peri-articular injection (PAI) and intra-articular injection
      (IAI) according to administration techniques. Currently, there is no definite
      answer to the optimal choice between the two techniques. Our study aims to
      investigate analgesic efficacy and safety of PAI versus IAI in patients receiving
      simultaneous bilateral TKA. Methods: This randomized controlled trial was
      conducted from February 2017 and finished in July 2018. Sixty patients eligible
      for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to
      receive PAI on one side and IAI on another. Primary outcomes included numerical
      rating scale (NRS) pain score at rest or during activity at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h,
      48 h, and 72 h following surgery. Secondary outcomes contained active or passive 
      range of motion (ROM) at 1, 2, and 3 days after surgery, time to perform straight
      leg raise, wound drainage, operation time, and wound complications. Results:
      Patients experienced lower NRS pain scores of the knee receiving PAI compared
      with that with PAI during the first 48 h after surgery. The largest difference of
      NRS pain score at rest occurred at 48 h (PAI: 0.68, 95%CI[0.37, 0.98]; IAI: 2.63,
      95%CI [2.16, 3.09]; P < 0.001); and the largest difference of NRS pain score
      during activity also took place at 48 h (PAI: 2.46, 95%CI [2.07, 2.85]; IAI:
      3.90, 95%CI [3.27, 4.52]; P = 0.001). PAI group had better results of range of
      motion and time to perform straight leg raise when compared with IAI group. There
      were no differences in operation time, wound drainage, and wound complication.
      Conclusion: PAI had the superior performance of pain relief and improvement of
      range of motion to IAI. Therefore, the administration technique of peri-articular
      injection is recommended when performing local infiltration analgesia after total
      knee arthroplasty. Trial registration: The trial was retrospectively registered
      in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry as ChiCTR1800020420 on 29th December,
      2018. Level of evidence: Therapeutic Level I.

TI  - The Detection of Opioid Misuse and Heroin Use From Paramedic Response
      Documentation: Machine Learning for Improved Surveillance.
LID - e15645
AB  - Background: Timely, precise, and localized surveillance of nonfatal events is
      needed to improve response and prevention of opioid-related problems in an
      evolving opioid crisis in the United States. Records of naloxone administration
      found in prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) data have helped estimate
      opioid overdose incidence, including nonhospital, field-treated cases. However,
      as naloxone is often used by EMS personnel in unconsciousness of unknown cause,
      attributing naloxone administration to opioid misuse and heroin use (OM) may
      misclassify events. Better methods are needed to identify OM. Objective: This
      study aimed to develop and test a natural language processing method that would
      improve identification of potential OM from paramedic documentation. Methods:
      First, we searched Denver Health paramedic trip reports from August 2017 to April
      2018 for keywords naloxone, heroin, and both combined, and we reviewed narratives
      of identified reports to determine whether they constituted true cases of OM.
      Then, we used this human classification as reference standard and trained 4
      machine learning models (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector
      machines, and L1-regularized logistic regression). We selected the algorithm that
      produced the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for model
      assessment. Finally, we compared positive predictive value (PPV) of the highest
      performing machine learning algorithm with PPV of searches of keywords naloxone, 
      heroin, and combination of both in the binary classification of OM in unseen
      September 2018 data. Results: In total, 54,359 trip reports were filed from
      August 2017 to April 2018. Approximately 1.09% (594/54,359) indicated naloxone
      administration. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement regarding OM in the
      narrative, 57.6% (292/516) were considered to include information revealing OM.
      Approximately 1.63% (884/54,359) of all trip reports mentioned heroin in the
      narrative. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 95.5% (784/821) were
      considered to include information revealing OM. Combined results accounted for
      2.39% (1298/54,359) of trip reports. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 
      77.79% (907/1166) were considered to include information consistent with OM. The 
      reference standard used to train and test machine learning models included
      details of 1166 trip reports. L1-regularized logistic regression was the highest 
      performing algorithm (AUC=0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.97) in identifying OM. Tested on
      5983 unseen reports from September 2018, the keyword naloxone inaccurately
      identified and underestimated probable OM trip report cases (63 cases; PPV=0.68).
      The keyword heroin yielded more cases with improved performance (129 cases;
      PPV=0.99). Combined keyword and L1-regularized logistic regression classifier
      further improved performance (146 cases; PPV=0.99). Conclusions: A machine
      learning application enhanced the effectiveness of finding OM among documented
      paramedic field responses. This approach to refining OM surveillance may lead to 
      improved first-responder and public health responses toward prevention of
      overdoses and other opioid-related problems in US communities.

PG  - 66-72
AB  - Background:: The literature on sexual dysfunction in patients on
      buprenorphine-naloxone (BNX) substitution is limited. Materials and Methods::
      This research aimed to study the prevalence and correlates of sexual dysfunction 
      in men on BNX substitution therapy. We recruited consecutive forty men from BNX
      clinic, who had received BNX for at least 6 months, who were free from any recent
      illicit drug use (confirmed by urine chromatographic immune assay), and who were 
      either married or had a stable sexual partner. Men with other psychiatric and
      substance use disorders (except tobacco) were excluded from the study. Data for
      the control group were obtained from a published study (with similar selection
      criteria) from our center. We assessed sexual dysfunction with two
      cross-culturally validated instruments: Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX)
      and International Index of Erectile Function. Results:: The sample had a mean age
      of 31.6 (±8) years; the mean duration of BNX treatment was 9 (±4.2) months and
      the mean BNX dose was 4.5 (±1.6) mg. ASEX showed the prevalence of sexual
      dysfunction to be 40%. The IIEF demonstrated intercourse dissatisfaction (95%)
      and hypoactive sexual desire (92.5%) as almost universal, while 77.5% of the
      participants reported erectile dysfunction. In comparison to the published data, 
      these figures were significantly more than among the controls. We found no
      correlation of sexual dysfunction with marital status, age, duration or dose of
      BNX, duration of illicit opioid use, the severity of opioid dependence, and
      tobacco dependence. Conclusion:: All men on BNX maintenance therapy must be
      screened for sexual dysfunction. With the rapid scaling up of office-based BNX
      substitution, assessment and management of sexual dysfunction ought to be
      incorporated in the training curriculum.

      depression in the United States: 2014 through 2019.
LID - 4
AB  - Background: Understanding how patients are treated in the real-world is vital to 
      identifying potential gaps in care. We describe the current pharmacologic
      treatment patterns for the treatment of depression. Methods: Patients with
      depression were identified from four large national claims databases during
      1/1/2014–1/31/2019. Patients had ≥2 diagnoses for depression or an inpatient
      hospitalization with a diagnosis of depression. Patients were required to have
      enrollment in the database ≥1 year prior to and 3 years following their first
      depression diagnosis. Treatment patterns were captured at the class level and
      included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, other
      antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics/sedatives, and antipsychotics. Treatment 
      patterns were captured during all available follow-up. Results: We identified
      269,668 patients diagnosed with depression. The proportion not receiving any
      pharmacological treatment during follow-up ranged from 29 to 52%. Of the treated,
      approximately half received ≥2 different classes of therapy, a quarter received
      ≥3 classes and more than 10% received 4 or more. SSRIs were the most common
      first-line treatment; however, many patients received an anxiolytic,
      hypnotic/sedative, or antipsychotic prior to any antidepressive treatment.
      Treatment with a combination of classes ranged from approximately 20% of
      first-line therapies to 40% of fourth-line. Conclusions: Many patients diagnosed 
      with depression go untreated and many others receive a non-antidepressant
      medication class as their first treatment. More than half of patients received
      more than one type of treatment class during the study follow up, suggesting that
      the first treatment received may not be optimal for most patients.

      surgery: Meta-analysis.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: Although enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has made great
      progress in the field of surgery, the guidelines point to the lack of
      high-quality evidence in upper gastrointestinal surgery. Methods: Randomized
      controlled trials in four electronic databases that involved ERAS protocols for
      upper gastrointestinal surgery were searched through December 12, 2018. The
      primary endpoints were lung infection, urinary tract infection, surgical site
      infection, postoperative anastomotic leakage and ileus. The secondary endpoints
      were postoperative length of stay, the time from end of surgery to first flatus
      and defecation, and readmission rates. Subgroup analysis was performed based on
      the type of surgery. Results: A total of 17 studies were included. The results of
      the meta-analysis indicate that there was a decrease in rates of lung infection
      (RR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.33 to 0.75), postoperative length of stay (MD = -2.53,
      95%CI: − 3.42 to − 1.65), time until first postoperative flatus (MD = -0.64,
      95%CI: − 0.84 to − 0.45) and time until first postoperative defecation
      (MD = -1.10, 95%CI: − 1.74 to − 0.47) in patients who received ERAS, compared to 
      conventional care. However, other outcomes were not significant difference. There
      was no significant difference between ERAS and conventional care in rates of
      urinary tract infection (P = 0.10), surgical site infection (P = 0.42),
      postoperative anastomotic leakage (P = 0.45), readmissions (P = 0.31) and ileus
      (P = 0.25). Conclusions: ERAS protocols can reduce the risk of postoperative lung
      infection and accelerating patient recovery time. Nevertheless, we should also
      consider further research ERAS should be performed undergoing gastrectomy and
      esophagectomy.

      saturation in home care: a preliminary retrospective cohort study.
LID - 3
AB  - Background: The role of oxygen therapy in end-of-life care for patients with
      advanced cancer is incompletely understood. We aimed to evaluate the association 
      between oxygen use and survival in patients with advanced cancer and low oxygen
      saturation in home care. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a 
      primary care practice in suburban Tokyo. Adult patients in home care with
      advanced cancer demonstrating first low oxygen saturation (less than 90%)
      detected in home visits were consecutively included in the study. Cox
      proportional hazards regression was used to investigate the effect of oxygen use 
      on overall survival and survival at home, adjusted for systolic blood pressure,
      decreased level of consciousness, dyspnea, oral intake, performance status, and
      cardiopulmonary comorbidity. Results: Of 433 identified patients with advanced
      cancer, we enrolled 137 patients (oxygen use, n = 35; no oxygen use, n = 102) who
      developed low oxygen saturation. In multivariable analysis, the adjusted hazard
      ratio (HR) of oxygen use was 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.39–1.17) for death
      and 0.70 (0.38–1.27) for death at home. In patients with dyspnea, the HR was 0.35
      (0.13–0.89) for death and 0.33 (0.11–0.96) for death at home; without dyspnea, it
      was 1.03 (0.49–2.17) for death and 0.84 (0.36–1.96) for death at home.
      Conclusions: Oxygen use was not significantly associated with survival in
      patients with advanced cancer and low oxygen saturation, after adjusting for
      potential confounders. It may not be necessary to use oxygen for prolongation of 
      survival in such patients, particularly in those without dyspnea.

TI  - A rapid positive influence of S-ketamine on the anxiety of patients in palliative
      care: a retrospective pilot study.
LID - 1
AB  - Background: Patients in palliative care need rapid-acting pharmacological options
      for psychological distress. N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine is known to 
      have a fast onset of anti-depressant and anxiolytic action. Its S-enantiomer
      S-ketamine (or esketamine) is an analgesic used as a routine treatment for
      refractory pain as an intravenous infusion (0.25 mg/kg over 45 min). This study
      investigates whether S-ketamine pain therapy has a positive impact on
      psychological distress caused by anxiety and depression in palliative care.
      Methods: Patient routine data from a palliative care unit of a tertiary care
      hospital were used in a retrospective analysis after positive ethics approval.
      Eight patients, who received analgesic S-ketamine treatment, were compared to a
      control group matched by gender and age. The main analysis was conducted using
      three-way mixed MANOVA followed by two-way mixed ANOVA. Target variables were the
      values for anxiety and depression in the state-trait anxiety-depression inventory
      STADI. The predictor variables were the time of measurement before (T1) and after
      (T2) S-ketamine application and group membership. Results: Comparison of the
      S-ketamine group (n = 8; 4 male, 4 female; average age 52 years) with the control
      group (n = 8; 3 male, 5 female; average age 55 years) revealed a significant
      multivariate effect on anxiety and depression F(1, 14) = 4.78; p = 0.046;
      r = 0.50. The univariate comparisons showed a significant reduction of the
      anxiety scores from T1 to T2 in the S-ketamine group compared to the control
      group F(1, 14) = 10.14; p = 0.007; r = 0.65. With regard to depression, there was
      no significant reduction from T1 to T2 in the group comparison F(1, 14) = 1.60;
      p = 0.23; r = 0.32. No long-lasting effects on pain were found. Conclusions: Our 
      findings show that psychological distress of patients in palliative care may
      improve after a single administration of S-ketamine, which mainly alleviates
      anxiety in those patients. Limitations of this study arise from
      non-randomization, retrospective analysis and low sample size. Therefore, further
      prospective and ideally randomized studies are necessary.

TI  - Cannabinoids and Opioids in the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.
LID - e00120
AB  - In traditional medicine, Cannabis sativa has been prescribed for a variety of
      diseases. Today, the plant is largely known for its recreational purpose, but it 
      may find a way back to what it was originally known for: a herbal remedy. Most of
      the plant's ingredients, such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol,
      cannabigerol, and others, have demonstrated beneficial effects in preclinical
      models of intestinal inflammation. Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids)
      have shown a regulatory role in inflammation and mucosal permeability of the
      gastrointestinal tract where they likely interact with the gut microbiome.
      Anecdotal reports suggest that in humans, Cannabis exerts antinociceptive,
      anti-inflammatory, and antidiarrheal properties. Despite these reports, strong
      evidence on beneficial effects of Cannabis in human gastrointestinal diseases is 
      lacking. Clinical trials with Cannabis in patients suffering from inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) have shown improvement in quality of life but failed to
      provide evidence for a reduction of inflammation markers. Within the endogenous
      opioid system, mu opioid receptors may be involved in anti-inflammation of the
      gut. Opioids are frequently used to treat abdominal pain in IBD; however, heavy
      opioid use in IBD is associated with opioid dependency and higher mortality. This
      review highlights latest advances in the potential treatment of IBD using
      Cannabis/cannabinoids or opioids.

TI  - The Evolving Microbiome from Pregnancy to Early Infancy: A Comprehensive Review.
LID - 133
AB  - Pregnancy induces a number of immunological, hormonal, and metabolic changes that
      are necessary for the mother to adapt her body to this new physiological
      situation. The microbiome of the mother, the placenta and the fetus influence the
      fetus growth and undoubtedly plays a major role in the adequate development of
      the newborn infant. Hence, the microbiome modulates the inflammatory mechanisms
      related to physiological and pathological processes that are involved in the
      perinatal progress through different mechanisms. The present review summarizes
      the actual knowledge related to physiological changes in the microbiota occurring
      in the mother, the fetus, and the child, both during neonatal period and beyond. 
      In addition, we approach some specific pathological situations during the
      perinatal periods, as well as the influence of the type of delivery and feeding.

TI  - Potentially inappropriate prescribing in dementia: a state-of-the-art review
      since 2007.
LID - e029172
AB  - Objectives: Dementia frequently occurs alongside comorbidities. Coexisting
      conditions are often managed with multiple medications, leading to increased risk
      of potentially inappropriate medication and adverse drug reactions. We aimed to
      estimate prevalence of, and identify factors reported to be associated with,
      potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) for older individuals diagnosed with 
      dementia. Design: We used a state-of-the-art review approach, selecting papers
      written in English and published from 2007 to January 2018. Publications were
      retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria included a
      formal diagnosis of dementia, a formal classification of PIP and reported
      prevalence of PIP as an outcome. Random effects models were used to provide a
      pooled estimate of prevalence of PIP. The Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional
      Studies (AXIS tool) was used to assess bias in the included studies. Results: The
      bibliographic search yielded 221 citations, with 12 studies meeting the inclusion
      criteria. The estimates of PIP prevalence for people living with dementia ranged 
      from 14% to 64%. Prevalence was 31% (95% CI 9 to 52) in the community, and 42%
      (95% CI 30 to 55) in nursing/care homes. PIP included prescribing likely related 
      to dementia (eg, hypnotics and sedative and cholinesterase inhibitors) and
      prescribing related to treatment of comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular drugs and
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication). Higher levels of comorbidity were
      associated with increased risk of PIP; however, only one study investigated
      associations with specific comorbidities of dementia. Conclusion: PIP remains a
      significant issue in healthcare management for people living with dementia.
      Higher levels of comorbidity are associated with increased prevalence of PIP, but
      the specific conditions driving this increase remain unknown. Further work is
      necessary to investigate PIP related to the presence of common comorbidities in
      patients living with dementia.

TI  - Antipsychotic Use in the Prevention and Treatment of Intensive Care Unit Delirium
      in Pediatric Patients.
PG  - 81-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the antipsychotics, route of administration, dosage
      regimen, and outcomes reported to prevent or treat delirium in hospitalized
      children. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts
      were searched using the keywords “haloperidol,” “olanzapine,” “quetiapine,”
      “risperidone,” “ziprasidone,” and “delirium.” Articles evaluating the use of
      these agents to manage delirium in hospitalized children that were published
      between 1946 and August 2019 were included. Two authors independently screened
      each article for inclusion. Reports were excluded if they were published
      abstracts or included fewer than 3 patients in the report. RESULTS: Thirteen
      reports that included 370 children receiving haloperidol, quetiapine, olanzapine,
      and/or risperidone for delirium treatment were reviewed. Most children received
      haloperidol (n = 131) or olanzapine (n = 125). Significant variability in dosing 
      was noted. A total of 23 patients (6.2%) had an adverse drug event, including 13 
      (56.5%) who experienced dystonia and 3 (13.0%) with a prolonged corrected QT
      interval. Most reports described improvement in delirium symptoms; however, only 
      5 reports used a validated screening tool for PICU delirium to evaluate
      antipsychotic response. CONCLUSIONS: Most reports noted efficacy with
      antipsychotics, but these reports were limited by sample size and lacked a
      validated PICU delirium tool. Future research is needed to determine the optimal 
      agent and dosage regimen to treat PICU delirium.

PG  - 59-64
AB  - The opioid crisis has shaped the national public health dialogue for some time
      now. A “call to action” is a strong and resounding cry from multiple disciplines.
      This piece intends to detail the nuts and bolts of prescribing medications used
      for the treatment of opioid use disorder. The underlying message here is that
      opioid use disorder is a chronic, treatable illness and physicians of all
      specialties have a responsibility to not turn a blind eye.

TI  - Ventilator Support and Oxygen Therapy in Palliative and End-of-Life Care in the
      Elderly.
PG  - 54-60
AB  - Elderly patients suffering from chronic cardio-pulmonary diseases commonly
      experience acute respiratory failure. As in younger patients, a well-known
      therapeutic approach of noninvasive mechanical ventilation is able to prevent
      orotracheal intubation in a large number of severe scenarios in elderly patients.
      In addition, this type of ventilation is frequently applied in elderly patients
      who refuse intubation for invasive mechanical ventilation. The rate of failure of
      noninvasive ventilation may be reduced by means of the integration of new
      technological devices (i.e., high-flow nasal cannula, extracorporeal CO2 removal,
      cough assistance and high-frequency chest wall oscillation, and fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy). Ethical issues with end-of-life decisions and the choice of the
      environment are not clearly defined in the treatment of elderly with acute
      respiratory insufficiency.

TI  - Nicotinic-nAChR signaling mediates drug resistance in lung cancer.
PG  - 1125-40
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Cigarette smoking is 
      the most common risk factor for lung carcinoma; other risks include genetic
      factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, secondhand smoke, and air pollution.
      Nicotine, the primary addictive constituent of cigarettes, contributes to cancer 
      progression through activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs),
      which are membrane ligand-gated ion channels. Activation of nicotine/nAChR
      signaling is associated with lung cancer risk and drug resistance. We focused on 
      nAChR pathways activated by nicotine and its downstream signaling involved in
      regulating apoptotic factors of mitochondria and drug resistance in lung cancer. 
      Increasing evidence suggests that several sirtuins play a critical role in
      multiple aspects of cancer drug resistance. Thus, understanding the consequences 
      of crosstalk between nicotine/nAChRs and sirtuin signaling pathways in the
      regulation of drug resistance could be a critical implication for cancer therapy.

TI  - The Evolving Pharmacotherapeutic Landscape for the Treatment of Sickle Cell
      Disease.
LID - e2020010
AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an extremely heterogeneous disease that has been
      associated with global morbidity and early mortality. More effective and
      inexpensive therapies are needed. During the last five years, the landscape of
      the pharmacotherapy of SCD has changed dramatically. Currently, 54 drugs have
      been used or under consideration to use for the treatment of SCD. These fall into
      3 categories: the first category includes the four drugs (Hydroxyurea,
      L-Glutamine, Crizanlizumab tmca and Voxelotor) that have been approved by the
      United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on successful clinical
      trials. The second category includes 22 drugs that failed, discontinued or
      terminated for now and the third category includes 28 drugs that are actively
      being considered for the treatment of SCD. Crizanlizumab and Voxelotor are
      included in the first and third categories because they have been used in more
      than one trial. New therapies targeting multiple pathways in the complex
      pathophysiology of SCD have been achieved or are under continued investigation.
      The emerging trend seems to be the use of multimodal drugs (i.e. drugs that have 
      different mechanisms of action) to treat SCD similar to the use of multiple
      chemotherapeutic agents to treat cancer.
